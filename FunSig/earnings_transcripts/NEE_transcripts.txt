===== 2025 Q1  (2025-04-23 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the NextEra Energy, Inc. First Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in the listen-only-mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mark Eidelman, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Mark Eidelman: Thank you, Dorwin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter 2025 financial results conference call for NextEra Energy. With me this morning are John Ketchum, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; Brian Bolster, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; Armando Pimentel, President and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light Company; Rebecca Kujawa, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources; Mark Hickson, Executive Vice President of NextEra Energy; and Mike Dunne, Treasurer of NextEra Energy. John will start with opening remarks, and then Mike will provide an overview of our first quarter results. Our executive team will then be available to answer your questions. We will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call in the Risk Factors section of the accompanying presentation or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found on our website at www.nexteraenergy.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. Today's presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of historical non-GAAP measures to the closest GAAP financial measure. With that, I'll turn the call over to John.
John Ketchum: Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy is once again off to a strong start for the year, delivering solid first quarter results. Adjusted earnings per share increased by nearly 9% year-over-year, reflecting solid financial and operational performance across FPL and Energy Resources. FPL placed into service 894 megawatts of new solar and Energy Resources originated approximately 3.2 gigawatts of new renewables and storage projects. We continue to see strong demand for new sources of generation across all sectors of the U.S. economy. For perspective, we expect more than 450 gigawatts of cumulative demand for new generation between now and 2030 in the United States. To meet this demand, we believe it's important to exercise what I describe as energy realism and energy pragmatism. Let me explain. Energy realism is about embracing all forms of energy solutions and understanding the demand for electricity in the United States is here now, and it's not slowing down. Frankly, it's unlike anything we've ever seen since the end of World War II. Energy pragmatism is about recognizing some technology is ready at scale today and other technology needs more time to get there, and there will be significant trade-offs with regard to the timing and cost of each. Today, renewables and battery storage are the lowest cost form of power generation and capacity. And we can build these projects and get new electrons on the grid in 12 to 18 months. We should be thinking about renewables and battery storage as a critical bridge to when other technology is ready at scale like new gas-fired plants. We expect 75 gigawatts of new gas to come online between now and 2030. That is significant for sure, but nowhere close to meeting the over 450 gigawatts of total generation we believe are needed. It's also important to understand that gas-fired plants will come online at a higher cost than renewables and storage. That's because gas turbines are in short supply and in high demand. It's also proving difficult to reestablish the highly skilled workforce required to build these complex power plants. Gas-fired combined cycle plants rely on approximately 1,000 workers across dozens of niche trades. We've learned EPCs are hiring thousands of extra people to address high washout rates with some workers leaving earlier for higher-paying jobs building, for example, LNG terminals, data centers, semiconductor chip manufacturing facilities and other industrial facilities. Other workers are showing up to job sites without the necessary skills. All of this puts upward pressure on prices and the time to build gas plants. It's why the cost to build a gas-fired plant has tripled in the last few years and is poised to increase even further due to tariff exposure. We believe nuclear will continue to play an important role in meeting demand. But again, we need to be practical about when that will happen. There are limited opportunities to restart shuttered nuclear units. Two are underway in our sector, and we continue to evaluate bringing our own Duane Arnold facility in Iowa back online. Beyond those limited opportunities, SMR technology is still 10 years away at scale in the best of scenarios and at a much higher price point than gas-fired generation. There's also an option to defer coal retirements to meet demand. But even if we kept online every coal plant in America slated to retire, it would only add approximately 40 gigawatts to the grid. And many are months away from retirement or are already slated to be converted to gas, again, far short of the over 450 gigawatts needed between now and 2030. Bottom line, don't take this as picking winners and losers. It's not nor can it be. America is going to need all forms of energy to meet this enormous demand. But we need to be practical about when technologies will be available at scale and how much they'll cost when they show up, all of which factors into how Americans pay - how much Americans pay on their electric bill each month. This is why energy policy in Washington is so important and why we cannot isolate ourselves to just a couple of technologies like gas and nuclear, which are much more expensive than they've ever been and take far longer to build. We say all this as a company in our space that does it all. NextEra Energy is the quintessential all forms of energy company. We know renewables and storage because we're a world leader in the space. We know gas because we operate the largest gas-fired fleet in America and have built more gas-fired generation than anyone over the last 2 decades. We know nuclear because we operate one of the largest fleets in the United States. And we know how to serve growth because we've been doing it for decades across the United States and in Florida, which brings me to Florida Power & Light Company. FPL is proof that embracing all forms of energy works, especially during periods of growth. Florida is the nation's third largest state and people continue to move here. In fact, we've added more than 1.3 million new customer accounts in the last 20 years, making us roughly 30% larger than we were in 2005. Despite the incredible growth, FPL consistently delivers high reliability while having customer bills significantly below the national average. And we continue to deliver what we believe is the best customer value proposition. As we celebrate our 100-year anniversary at FPL, our vision remains the same, to continue making smart capital investments for the benefit of our customers, be an industry leader on cost and deliver high reliability and outstanding customer service while keeping bills low for our customers. To continue driving customer value and to power Florida's growth, we've been deploying the most cost-effective option for customers, solar and storage and now have approximately 8.4 gigawatts of solar and batteries installed across Florida. In all, our generation strategy has saved customers more than $16 billion in avoided fuel costs since 2001. Looking ahead, at FPL, we continue to see growth on the horizon, and we are projecting to add roughly 335,000 customer accounts through 2029. To continue to meet growth and reliably serve customers, FPL plans to invest nearly $50 billion from 2025 to 2029 and add more than 25 gigawatts of new generation of battery storage by 2034. On February 28, we submitted testimony and detailed information for FPL's 2025 base rate proceeding. The overall proposal for our 2026 through 2029 base rate plan is consistent with the test year letter filed in December. The stability of multiyear plans has allowed FPL to focus on efficiency in the business, which is critical to keeping customer bills low and has enabled FPL to maintain a strong balance sheet, which allows for consistent access to the capital markets. We look forward to the opportunity to showcase our long-term track record of providing low bills and high reliability for Floridians and our plans to build an even more resilient energy future for Florida. We believe FPL is strategically positioned as Florida remains one of the fastest-growing states in the U.S. and we plan to meet Florida's long-term growth outlook with investments in generation, transmission and distribution infrastructure, which we believe will further enhance our best-in-class customer value proposition. Energy Resources had a strong quarter, originating approximately 3.2 gigawatts of new renewables and battery storage projects. This marks the fifth time over the past 7 quarters that Energy Resources has added more than 3 gigawatts to its backlog, a sign of the continued strong demand for new generation. Energy Resources also had its largest solar origination quarter and largest solar and battery storage origination quarter ever, again, demonstrating the strong demand for renewables and storage because they are low cost and can be deployed now. Assuming we achieve the midpoint of our development expectations range, Energy Resources will be operating in more than 70 gigawatt generation and storage portfolio by the end of 2027. Taking FPL and Energy Resources together, we believe NextEra Energy has the most comprehensive power generation business in the world and is well positioned to capitalize on long-term growth prospects. There has been ample discussion about tariffs these last few weeks. While this has forced some companies to look at their supply chains for the first time, we've spent the last 3 years diversifying and domesticating ours to strategically position our supplier relationships to manage potential disruption. For perspective, we've dramatically diversified where we source our solar panels. As a result, we don't source solar panels from countries impacted by the antidumping and countervailing duty tariff rates announced earlier this week. Plus, we source our wind turbines from the U.S. with manufacturing in Florida. And because of our buying power, we have been able to significantly shift tariff risk to suppliers. After discussion with our suppliers, we currently estimate Energy Resources has less than $150 million in tariff exposure through 2028 on over $75 billion in expected capital spend. That's less than 0.2% of potential impact to our capital spend before exercising contractual trade measure protections in our contracts with customers. Size and scale matter more than ever in today's environment. Suppliers want us to be repeat customers, and our customers want certainty, certainty that comes with doing business with an industry leader like NextEra Energy that has a long track record of delivering on its commitments. Once we work with our customers, we expect our $150 million tariff exposure to be significantly reduced, potentially down to zero. Still, we continue to look for ways to further mitigate trade risk and use our supply chain management capabilities to create new opportunities. Our team had the foresight last year to secure arrangements to purchase U.S.-made batteries for a significant portion of our backlog with the remainder of the batteries sourced outside of China where tariff exposure is contractually allocated to the supplier. Batteries are already more than two times cheaper than gas-fired plants available now and much more flexible to interconnect to the grid. Taking most tariff exposure off the table for our customers in need of battery storage solutions is a big win and a way for us to meet demand while keeping bills low for customers. Our battery sourcing strategy gives us optionality and favorable pricing through our already secured domestic battery supply contracts. In short, our tariff exposure on batteries is expected to be negligible and we expect our domestic sourcing options to create significant competitive advantages for us and our customers going forward as we originate new battery storage projects. Finally, we now have nearly $37 billion of interest rate hedges in place that allows us to flexibly manage interest rate exposure over the coming years, including interest rate hedges on 100% of our backlog and a large portion of our upcoming maturities. In fact, we entered into swaps as part of our programmatic hedging strategy when interest rates sharply declined in early April after reciprocal tariffs were announced, putting our hedged risk-free rate at roughly 3.9%. Our interest rate sensitivity is included in the appendix of today's presentation. Before I hand it over to Mike, I want to briefly touch on last month's planned leadership transition announcement. As we announced in March, after 18 years of service to NextEra Energy, Rebecca Kujawa will be retiring. Rebecca has had an incredible career at our company and has brought a strong strategic perspective and leadership approach to everything she's accomplished. Brian Bolster will succeed Rebecca as President and CEO of NextEra Energy Resources. Brian has done an amazing job as our CFO and has the ideal combination of capabilities, experience and customer relationships to lead one of America's largest energy infrastructure development companies. Mike Dunne has been promoted and will succeed Brian as CFO of NextEra Energy. Mike has deep financial acumen and vast knowledge of the energy industry, having spent his entire career in this sector. Both Brian and Mike are effectively transitioning into their new roles. We believe we have the best team in the industry with a track record of delivering day in and day out. There is no team better equipped or better positioned to help meet this unique moment. That's not to say it will be easy. The enormous electricity demand in the United States creates challenges and not getting this right risks higher power prices. But this is where NextEra Energy shines. We thrive when the stakes are high. We lean into complexity. It's what differentiates us. So many companies are approaching this moment from a standing start. We've been running this marathon for decades, and I couldn't be more optimistic about our prospects to deliver for our customers with the outstanding team we have in place. With that, let me turn it over to Mike, who will review first quarter results in more detail.
Mike Dunne: Thanks, John. For the first quarter of 2025, FPL's earnings per share increased $0.07 year-over-year. The principal driver of this performance was FPL's regulatory capital employed growth of approximately 8.1% year-over-year. We continue to expect FPL to realize more than 10% average annual growth in regulatory capital employed over our current rate agreement's 4-year term, which runs through 2025. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $2.4 billion for the quarter, and we expect FPL's full year capital investments to be between $8 billion and $8.8 billion. For the 12 months ending March 2025, FPL's reported return on equity for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.6%. During the first quarter, we utilized approximately $622 million of reserve amortization, leaving FPL with a balance of roughly $274 million. As we previously discussed, FPL historically uses more reserve amortization in the first half of the year. We expect this trend to continue this year. This quarter, FPL placed into service 894 megawatts of new cost-effective solar, putting FPL's owned and operated solar portfolio at over 7.9 gigawatts, which is the largest utility-owned solar portfolio in the country. In April, FPL filed its annual 10-year site plan, which continues to indicate that solar and storage are the most cost-effective options for customers to add reliable grid energy and capacity over the next decade. The 2025 plan projects the need for over 17 gigawatts of cost-effective solar generation across our service territory over the next 10 years. And as a complement to FPL's planned solar additions, FPL is planning to deploy over 7.6 gigawatts of battery storage, which provides cost-effective capacity. With this plan, we expect to increase FPL's solar mix from approximately 9% of our total generation in 2024 to approximately 35% in 2034, while continuing to provide customers with low cost and reliable energy. As John mentioned, on February 28, we submitted testimony and detailed supporting information for FPL's 2025 base rate proceeding. We are requesting a base rate adjustment of approximately $1.5 billion starting in January 2026. $927 million in January 2027 and a solar and base rate adjustment or SoBRA mechanism to recover revenue requirements for solar and battery storage projects in 2028 and 2029. With the proposed base rate adjustments and current projections for fuel and other costs, we believe that FPL's typical residential customer bill will grow at an average rate of about 2.5% from January in 2025 through the end of 2029, which is expected to result in FPL's typical residential bill being approximately 25% below the projected national average and more than 20% lower than our typical bills 20 years ago when adjusted for inflation. Florida Public Service Commission has established a schedule for this proceeding, beginning with quality of service hearings in May and technical hearings in mid-August. The proceedings would likely conclude in the fourth quarter with staff recommendation and commission rulings on revenue requirements and rates. We look forward to the opportunity to present our case to the commission this summer and are focused on achieving a balanced outcome that supports continued smart investments for the benefit of our customers. Key indicators show that Florida's economy remains healthy. Florida continues to be one of the fastest-growing states in the nation and had 3 of the 5 fastest-growing U.S. metro areas between 2023 and 2024. FPL had a strong quarter of customer growth, with the average number of customers increasing by nearly 108,000 from the comparable prior year period. FPL's first quarter retail sales increased by approximately 1.8% year-over-year. After taking weather into account, first quarter retail sales increased by roughly 0.6% on a weather-normalized basis from the comparable prior year period, driven primarily by continued favorable underlying population growth. Now let's turn to Energy Resources, which reported adjusted earnings growth of nearly 10% year-over-year. Contributions from new investments increased $0.12 per share year-over-year, primarily reflecting continued growth in our power generation portfolio. Our existing clean energy portfolio declined $0.03 per share during the quarter associated with various puts and takes in the business. And the comparative contribution from our customer supply business decreased by $0.01 per share. Contributions from NextEra Energy Transmission increased $0.01 per share year-over-year. All other impacts decreased by $0.05 per share, driven by higher interest costs of $0.06 per share, half of which are related to new borrowing costs to support our new investments. As we previously disclosed and as we deemphasize the business, we have reclassified gas infrastructure to include gas pipelines and existing clean energy and upstream gas infrastructure in customer supply. Gas pipelines and upstream gas infrastructure each had a $0.01 decline in the quarter. Energy Resources originated approximately 3.2 gigawatts of new renewables and storage to the backlog. With these additions, our backlog now totals roughly 28 gigawatts after taking into account 0.7 gigawatts of new projects placed into service since our last earnings call. This highlights the continued strong growth for renewables and storage. We're also excited to announce our first solar repowering project, which we expect to be completed in 2026. Going forward, we plan to include both wind and solar repowering megawatts in the newly updated repowering line of our development expectations. Our backlog additions represent the diverse power demand that we are seeing across industries. Roughly 40% of our backlog additions are driven by commercial and industrial customer demand, while 60% are driven by demand from power companies. As evidenced by our nearly 1 gigawatt additions, our customers continue to choose battery storage as the lowest cost, ready now solution to meet their capacity needs. Turning now to our first quarter 2025 consolidated results. Adjusted earnings from Corporate and Other decreased by $0.03 per share year-over-year. Our long-term financial expectations remain unchanged. We will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted EPS expectation ranges in 2025, 2026 and 2027. From 2023 to 2027, we expect that our average annual growth in operating cash flow will be at or above our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. We also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at a roughly 10% rate per year through at least 2026 off of a 2024 base. As always, our expectations assume our caveats. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we will open the line for questions.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Steve Fleishman: Yeah. Good morning. Thank you. So first, just related to the tariff disclosure you provided, which sounded very good. The - the battery portion where you're moving a lot domestic, I assume that means you're also getting domestic battery cells as part of that. Is that right?
John Ketchum: The way the contract works, we get certain components - Steve, sorry, I cut off there for a minute. Let me start over. So with the battery - the domestic battery contract that we have entered into, it is assembled here in the United States. There are certain components that come in from outside the United States, but because it's assembled here and has enough concentration here in the U.S., it qualifies for domestic content. And we have contractual protections in the agreement in place regarding the qualification for domestic content. And also to the extent that there is any tariff exposure related to any imported parts or components related to those batteries, those are protected as well and backstopped by substantial credits. So that is a domestic contract, and that's the way investors should think about it.
Steve Fleishman: Got it. Thanks for that. And then just in terms of the exposure on the tariff exposure, which you know, you've talked for a long time about making sure that you're protected there with your suppliers. Obviously, one of the issues can be making sure that the suppliers still supply while they absorb tariffs. Just how do you feel about the supplier health to kind of meet the commitments as well?
John Ketchum: I feel good. I feel very good for two reasons. One, given the buying power that NextEra has, suppliers don't want to disappoint, and they want to make sure they fall through. They're looking at this as a long game for their business. Second, the way our contracts are set up with our credit protections in the agreement, there's a very strong incentive to fall through on those commitments. And then the third point that I would make is that, the U.S. still remains an extremely attractive market to suppliers across the globe, meaning that they have a lot of margin when they deliver into the U.S. And when we put those three things together, I lose no sleep over whether or not our suppliers will fall through on their commitments and deliver into the U.S.
Steve Fleishman: Yeah. Got it. Makes sense. And then just on the - switching to a lot of focus these days on IRA, obviously, and changes and specifically on transferability. And so maybe just one clarification on transferability. In the event, hypothetically, if it were to go away in the future in a bill, do you - would it still be applicable for existing assets that were done under transferability as well as safe harbor assets on transferability?
John Ketchum: Yeah. So I mean, there was a recent piece of legislation that was brought forward that basically, you know, the Fedorchak [ph] bill, I'll use that as an example to answer the question. So on the Fedorchak [ph] bill, the way it was structured is that you'd see tech neutral eliminated through a phase down, but with transferability eventually being phased out there. However, under the non-tech neutral portion, there would be an ability to continue the safe harbor for 4 years and transferability is left in place there. So it all comes down to the drafting Steve, at the end of the day, that's how that bill was drafted. It would depend on the ultimate outcome and drafting of future bills. But let me just make a couple of comments on transferability. We spent a lot of time obviously advocating for tax credits and transferability for good reason. And the reasons are, I think, well known by investors. Gas has its limitations in terms of availability for the reasons I went through in the prepared remarks. They're a lot more expensive. Gas turbines have been hit by tariffs, too, and a lot of folks don't talk about that, which is actually going to - I think we had put the proxy at 2,400 a kW at our Development Day. It's probably closer to 2,600 to 2,800 today when you factor in tariffs, gas turbines have actually been hit harder than, I think, solar or wind or storage in that regard. And so we need a bridge. And that bridge has to come from renewables and storage because we have all this demand today. It's got to be met by something. And the ability to transfer credits, it goes hand in glove with the credit itself. You have to be able to monetize the credit to be able to get the benefit back to the customer. And I'll use a couple of examples. I mean, utilities, for example, right? And this is one of the things that we continue to stress in Washington. Utilities historically have struggled to use tax equity financing. Commissions won't approve it. It's - you have to sell half the plant to qualify for tax equity financing. And so how do you get the benefit, which we calculate to be a 12% increase in household income to the ultimate utility customer without the ability to transfer the credit. Nuclear, I'll use as an example. So with nuclear, a tax equity structure doesn't work, right? There's no bank that's going to take a 50% ownership interest in a nuclear plant. And so you have to have transferability for nuclear as well. And nuclear is going to play an important part of our future. It's definitely a focus of this administration. 45X as well. If you didn't have transferability on credits for wind, solar, storage, nuclear, 45X becomes very difficult, right? How do you stimulate all these investments, 80% of which are going into Republican jurisdictions, when you're trying to convince a CEO to build a manufacturing facility under 45X, but if the credit is not there with the ability to transfer it on the back end for wind, solar, battery storage, the demand for the product is not there either. And so what's the incentive to invest billions of dollars in the manufacturing facility under a 45X credit. So when you put all of these things together, credits and transferability go together. You have to - you can't have one without the other. That's the message we're bringing to Washington. It's one that's being well understood. I think the evidence lies in the fact that we just had 21 house representatives, Republican House Representatives sign on to a letter saying, don't touch the credits, don't touch transferability. We had 4 senators say the same, you know, sign on to a very similar letter. They get it. They get the 2 go together. Will it be a little bit of a bumpy ride as we maybe see some proposed bills? Sure. But I think at the end of the day, folks in Washington understand that transferability and tax credits are hand in glove and go together. You have to have an ability to monetize the tax credit.
Steve Fleishman: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, John team, thank you all very much. And it's congrats - congrats again on all the new roles here. Very well deserved. John, maybe just to start with a little bit of a more mundane question. You're talking about going to the higher end of the range here at near [ph] Do you want to talk a little bit about what the contributing factors are there for '25? And then I've got a quick follow-up on what you just said there.
John Ketchum: Yeah. So when I think about higher end of the range, I start with the first quarter results, right? I mean we're already out of the gate at 9%. And we have a business plan that we feel good about, feel good about executing against. And I don't think there's a whole lot more to say about that.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Awesome. Thank you. And then look, I really appreciate the details on transferability. I know folks have been very keen to hear from you guys on that. Related here, can you speak a little bit on the timing dynamics on when and how that ultimately will work? You say in your remarks, once we work with our customers, how do you think about the impact 150 from a timing perspective on '25 versus is that really going to get to that zero in '26? It seems like this is sort of an assumption that principally the tariff impact is going to impact customers with higher PPAs and you're going to go back to them today, perhaps like what we saw before with maybe some of the COVID impacts.
John Ketchum: So Julien, your question is on tariffs, right, not transferability.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yeah, sorry. Yeah, sorry. No, I thank you on the transferability.
John Ketchum: So let me make sure I got focused on transferability. You pivoted tariffs. Can you clarify your question on tariffs, just so I understand the question.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yeah. The timing of that, right? So you talk about supply chain, you say once you work with your customers, how do you think about the time line for working with your customers? And is the reason for your tariff exposure to be fairly low principally because you are passing along those costs to your customers in revised PPAs? Or do you have existing contractual terms?
John Ketchum: Yeah. So let me take those in pieces. Let's just start with the supplier first. So when we look at our entire backlog, right? And we look at our projected Q2 originations, and we look out at the development expectations that we've told investors, we think that we're looking at around $150 million of exposure on tariffs. That is based on the contractual protections we have in our existing contracts with suppliers and the discussions that we have had with them since Liberation Day on April 2. So that's the first piece. So that works you down to $150 million. Then the point we were making in the prepared remarks is that not only do we have the ability to shift tariff risk to suppliers and supply contracts, which I just covered, we also have trade measure protection provisions in our customer contracts. So we believe we got a really good shot at working with our customers to take that $150 million exposure down significantly and perhaps even down to zero if we use the track record we had around circumvention, a lot of lessons learned there. And these are rights that we already have embedded in our agreements. And so when I think about where we stand, I feel very good about tariffs. It's just not going to have much of an impact at all on our business.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: If I can clarify quickly, the reason there's 150 is because you have to go back and clarify the contract?
John Ketchum: The reason that it is 150 is that there are certain risk-sharing mechanisms in contracts. Most of the contracts, the supplier takes all the risk. Some of the contracts, they take almost all of the risk, except for a small sliver that we work through with them.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. All right. Thank you guys very much. Thank you, John.
John Ketchum: And Julien, I want to make one more point, and I want to make sure folks understand this from the remarks. That's $150 million on $75 billion of CapEx. That's less than 0.2%. And we feel like we've got a good shot at getting that to zero.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Incredible. Honestly.
John Ketchum: And final point I'll make is, and Steve asked me a little bit about it, but there's been a lot written about battery exposure. We don't have battery exposure. Full stop. We do not have battery exposure. We are really well positioned. We entered into a domestic contract. We have actually a real opportunity rather than a risk around batteries.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Nick Campanella with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Nick Campanella: Hey, good morning. And thanks for taking the question. So maybe just to close the loop on the tariff discussions, just where do you think returns are from an IRR perspective or an ROE perspective? These protections that you have in place versus your competitors should make you more competitive, I would think. Does that boost your returns? Or do you see these kind of remaining flat in the post-tariff world? Maybe you could address that.
John Ketchum: Yeah, I mean - yeah, I mean, great - that's a great question, Nick. So I look at it a couple of different ways. I mean, first of all, we're in great shape on our returns for all the obvious reasons we just covered. So I don't think I need to spend time on that. I look at this as a huge opportunity for us because we compete again against a lot of small developers, and they don't have the buying power or the leverage in contracts to be able to shift risk like we can. We started looking at this 3 years ago. We've been at it. We didn't just wake up on November 6 and say, oh my God, what do we do about our supply chain? I mean we've been thinking about this for years. And so we put the right things in place. This is going to create a lot of opportunity for us. So if circumvention is any example, what happened in circumvention is a lot of small developers blew themselves up, couldn't satisfy their commitments with their customers and a lot of demand came our way. And so I would expect - that's my point around opportunity that given the position that we're in around tariffs, I expect a lot of opportunity to come our way as small developers just aren't in the position we are. They're trying to absorb a significant amount of risk, particularly those that are - that have entered into contracts for batteries, because they probably are buying from Chinese manufacturers and don't have domestic contracts and don't have the position that we have.
Nick Campanella: Thanks for that. And then just maybe a quick update on where you stand in the Duane Arnold contracting opportunity. I think you were working through an engineering study beforehand. How is that kind of progressing? And how have discussions been in terms of getting a contract for this site? Thanks.
John Ketchum: It's going great. We continue to make a lot of progress at Duane Arnold. We have seen no showstoppers there and continue to see a lot of demand for generation from the project. So I think it continues to be an opportunity that's exciting for us. And look, we continue to work it as we move forward.
Nick Campanella: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Jeremy Tonet: Hi. Good morning.
John Ketchum: Good morning.
Jeremy Tonet: I just want to touch base, I guess, on the GEV partnership and if there's any update that you can provide to us granted it's recent since you talked about the Developer Day, but just wondering, any updated thoughts to share there?
John Ketchum: Yeah. I mean things with - under the framework agreement continue to advance. We've been doing work together on the customer origination side. As a matter of fact, we hosted an event last week that we call Deploy following Development Day, where Scott and I jointly hosted a number of companies across various sectors. And very fruitful, and we continue to try to advance opportunities on that front, particularly around large-scale load.
Jeremy Tonet: Okay. Great. Thanks. And maybe just kind of continuing with this a little bit more. I just wanted to see, I guess, you talked a lot about gas development time line for new turbines. But just as we look in the outer years here, just wondering how you think, I guess, gas power factors in for hyperscalers specifically, I guess, how conversations are going there, given decarbonization goals, but the attributes that gas can offer as well? Just any updated thoughts there would be great.
John Ketchum: Yeah. It's interesting because we talked a lot about this at Development Day. I mean there's three things we shoot for, right? One is just achieving the development expectations. I'll call it kind of the, the status quo plain vanilla business that we advance every quarter. The second is large load, and that kind of falls into two camps. One is behind the meter discussions and the second is front of the meter discussions. And we continue to see a strong preference by hyperscalers for front of the meter solutions, which means ultimately a 3-way conversation, right, between us, investor-owned utilities and the hyperscaler because the hyperscaler wants two things, right? They want the reliability that comes with being interconnected to the grid that you don't get from behind the meter. And two, they want the optionality of being able to monetize power if need be, which also comes by being interconnected to - to the grid. So that's kind of how I see the market moving forward. We also do continue dialogue around behind the meter. There's a premium, obviously, that has to be paid for the additional redundancy you have to build on the generation side. But for some, that's worth pursuing because the grid could be difficult to access in certain parts of the United States, can take 5, 7 years. And is the additional premium for redundant generation worth the avoided cost of not having to go through trying to get interconnected. But even in those situations, they're looking for a path ultimately to be interconnected to the grid. And from a gas standpoint, which is really your question, definitely something that they are looking at as part of the solution. But they also remain observant and cautious about wanting to understand what the carbon offset is to the emissions off the plant, which is, I think, where our skill set comes in - comes to bear perfectly because we can, through VPPAs and other arrangements provide a nice combination of gas-fired generation together with renewable solutions that provide a nice large-scale fix that can leave the site essentially carbon neutral or close to carbon neutral at the end of the day, which is very attractive to these customers. And I think that is why we are uniquely positioned to serve that market in partnership with the terrific relationships that we've been able to build with investor-owned utilities over the last 20 or 30 years and with the strong relationships we have with the hyperscale market. So more to come on that.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. That's helpful. I'll leave it there. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
David Arcaro: Hey, good morning. Thanks so much. I wanted to go back to transferability just for a quick follow-up there. Wondering what the contingency plan might be if there were changes or restrictions on the use of tax credit transfers. What would the financing alternative be as you think about your overall kind of holistic financing plan?
John Ketchum: Yeah. Great question. So as we look and if you think about our company over 2 decades before 2022, we had - we used tax equity to finance our tax credits, and we able to do that in a very programmatic and good basis. If we look today, we are seeing a flight to quality from tax equity providers coming to us where they're looking because our projects get done on time, because they perform. And what we've seen over the course of the last 2 years is essentially a doubling of the tax equity providers looking to work with us. Also, a key piece of our transfer program allows us to pick the best project returns between transferability and tax equity. When it comes to PTC projects, the returns can be higher in times of transferability, but from a credit perspective, essentially the same outcome. So as we work through, we've done this for 20 years. We're seeing tax equity come to us. And we're - so we're not saying that there will be no impacts. We feel very good about where we sit from a financing perspective for transferability.
David Arcaro: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then I appreciate the comments you gave to Jeremy's question. I was wondering maybe a bit higher level, what are you seeing in terms of renewable demand trends from tech customers, specifically in data center opportunities? Has there been, I guess, any change in the interest there or the load growth or demand growth that you're seeing from the data center side of things?
John Ketchum: Short answer is no change. We continue to see a lot of appetite for renewables and it fits perfectly with the discussion that we continue to have on the GE Vernova side around providing gas-fired generation as a potential solution as well. But they remain very focused too on renewables, right? They're ready now. They're low cost. They're an offset for gas if they ultimately decide to go that route in a part of the country that doesn't have excess grid capacity and the load studies taking too long to complete. And when I look at the demand and the outlook in the renewable sector going forward, and we always are looking a quarter out or so. I mean, we just continue to see strong demand across the board and with hyperscalers being a nice size part of that.
David Arcaro: Okay. Excellent. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Carly Davenport with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Carly Davenport: Hey. Good morning. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Maybe a higher-level one. Just as you think about the backlog additions, can you talk a bit about the 2024 to 2027 plan relative to the additions for post-2027 delivery? Do you see any risk around project slippage beyond the current plan into 2028 plus just given the more uncertain macro environment and potentially more complex contract discussions? Or you still feel confident in the execution there?
John Ketchum: Yeah, Carly, I mean good question. So maybe I'll start just with circumvention and remind folks that when we saw circumvention, we did see some shifting out in demand, right? And that's impacted, I think, our - some of the near-term development expectations with us forecast to come in the low end of the range on the '24, '25 numbers. You can see that in the development forecast write-up. But then we were also able to push those projects in the '26, '27, '28 and some of the out years. I think that dynamic was more specific to circumvention than it is here. I think here, there's just so much demand and the need for electrons right now where customers just can't afford to wait. And gas is such a long-term solution. I mean, we've gone up from 4.5 years to build a combined cycle unit to 6 or longer. And so needing the electrons now, I think that is foreseeing more near-term demand. Obviously, some of the impact too will ultimately depend on where we come out with Washington, but you've heard my comments there.
Carly Davenport: Great. That's really helpful. Thank you. I'll leave it there.
Operator: The next question comes from Bill Appicelli with UBS. Please go ahead.
Bill Appicelli: Hi. Good morning. Just a couple of questions on the utility. The 10-year site plan that you guys filed, how should we think about that impacting the capital expenditure program relative to the $34 billion to $37 billion, does that have any impact on that? And or is it sort of post that? And should we assume a higher run rate than the sort of 8.8 to 8.9 that you've outlined for '26, '27?
Armando Pimentel: It's Armando, Bill. Good morning. I don't think you think about it any differently. The CapEx plan that we filed in our rate case for the next 4 years is roughly $50 billion of CapEx, right, over the next over the next 4 years. The 8.8% or so that you just highlighted is roughly in line with what our expectations would be over the next 4 years. And it's driven by making sure that we continue to do the best thing for our customers. We expect 335,000 new customers over the next 4 years in the FPL area, and that drives a lot of investment, one, and then the additional investment, part of that $50 billion is to make sure that we can continue to make our customers' value proposition better. So I think it's more of the same.
Bill Appicelli: Okay. And then regarding the rate case, is settlement still a preferred outcome here? And is that window of time ahead of those technical hearings in August?
John Ketchum: I think settlement is always something that's on the table. Obviously, it takes 2 sides to - in our case, since there's a number of interveners, more than 2 sides to come together to get to, for us, a conclusion that's good for our customers, right? This is all about our customers and making sure that we can get the best outcome for them long term. If you look at historically, excuse me, where we've had settlements, they've generally been anywhere from 6 weeks before the rate case is supposed to start, which in this case would be mid-August to right before, right after the actual rate case. So if there is going to be a settlement, then that's the likely outcome. Certainly, it could happen outside of that time. It could happen at any time. But our focus right now is really on putting together the best case that we can for our customers starting mid-August.
Bill Appicelli: Okay. And then just one last quick one. The 11.6% ROE, given the amount of surplus amortization that was utilized, I mean, should that trend a little bit lower over the balance of the year? Or is the expectation that, that can be maintained?
John Ketchum: So we're required at the beginning of the year to file with our commission and let them know what our expectations are for the year. Obviously, that can change. You saw that change last year when we lowered it. But our expectation is that 11.6% is about right based on the expectations that we have for normal weather this year. We'll obviously take a look at that every quarter, but 11.6% is our expectation for the year right now.
Bill Appicelli: Great. Thank you so much.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session and our conference. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q4  (2025-01-24 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the NextEra Energy Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Also note today's event is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the floor over to Mark Eidelman, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Mark Eidelman: Thank you, Jamie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results conference call for NextEra Energy. With me this morning are John Ketchum, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; Brian Bolster, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; Armando Pimentel, President and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light Company; Rebecca Kujawa, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources; and Mark Hickson, Executive Vice President of NextEra Energy. John will start with opening remarks and then Brian will provide an overview of our results. Our executive team will then be available to answer your questions. We will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call, and the Risk Factors section of the accompanying presentation or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found on our website www.nexteraenergy.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. Today's presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information, reconciliations of historical non-GAAP measures to the closest GAAP financial measure. With that, I'll turn the call over to John.
John Ketchum: Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy had strong operational and financial performance in 2024, delivering full year adjusted earnings per share of $3.43, up over 8% from 2023, once again at the high end of our adjusted EPS expectations range. Since 2021, we have delivered compound annual growth and adjusted EPS of over 10%, which is the highest among all top 10 power companies. In fact, if you looked over the last five, 10, 15 and 20 years, you will see the same absolute and relative performance. Our consistent financial outperformance is due first and foremost to the efforts and execution by our team. I couldn't be more proud of how our team has continued to deliver and I firmly believe that our track record of execution positions us to lead the build out of energy infrastructure across the country in the coming years. NextEra Energy offers a unique value proposition with two strong businesses that we believe are strategically well-positioned to meet the growing needs of our customers with outstanding prospects for future growth. FPL is the largest electric utility in the U.S. and Energy Resources is the world's leader in renewables and storage. Together, we operate the largest natural gas fire generation fleet in the country are one of the largest nuclear operators in the U.S. and are widely viewed as an industry leader in transmission. We are one of the top five infrastructure investors in the United States and we have invested more than $150 billion in our nation's energy infrastructure over the last decade, building everything from nuclear upgrades, natural gas pipelines and natural gas fire generation to battery storage and renewables. Over the next four years alone, we plan to invest roughly $120 billion across the country, which would allow us to grow our combined fleet to roughly 121 gigawatts. FPL and Energy Resources individually have executed well, delivering value for our customers and shareholders. We have one of the sector's strongest balance sheets and between the two companies, we placed into service approximately 8.7 gigawatts of new renewables and storage projects in 2024. Let me start by giving you an update on each of our businesses and then provide you with some comments on the state of our industry. FPL continued to deliver what we believe is the best customer value proposition in one of the fastest growing states in the U.S. As we approach our 100 year anniversary at FPL, our vision remains the same to continue making smart capital investments for the benefit of our customers, be an industry leader on costs and deliver high reliability and outstanding customer service, while keeping bills as low as possible for our customers. In 2024, we continue to see the fruits of that smart capital spend. For nearly two decades, FPL has invested in building a stronger, smarter and more storm resilient grid. The performance of our system demonstrates that FPL's hardening, undergrounding, automation and smart grid investments are providing significant benefits to our customers. Our investments in smart grid technology enabled us to avoid more than 2.7 million outages in 2024, and those investments paid off as our team responded exceptionally well in response to Hurricanes Debby, Helene and Milton. We are able to deliver this performance and keep our bills 40% below the national average because of our focus on capital and operating efficiency and innovation. FPL continued to make smart capital investments in low cost solar generation and battery storage, further reducing our overall fuel cost. During the year, we placed into service more than 2.2 gigawatts of new cost effective solar and we expect to add more than 15 gigawatts by 2033. When combined with generation modernizations, these additions have saved customers more than $16 billion since 2001. We also continue to focus on running the business more efficiently. In 2024, we improved upon our best-in-class non-fuel O&M cost per customer, which was already 70% better than the industry's national average, saving customers over $3 billion per year versus an average performing utility. Innovation has been one of the keys to our operating efficiency. FPL is the only utility in the nation to remotely operate its fossil fleet. Our Fleet Control Center is one of the world's largest monitoring and diagnostic centers and the first in the industry to remotely operate a more than 20 gigawatt natural gas combined cycle fleet from a single location, providing real time troubleshooting with engineering, maintenance and operation support and delivering world class predictive analytics and diagnostics. This is just one example of the innovative efforts by FPL to reduce costs for our customers, while continuing to provide exceptional service. Late last year, FPL filed a test year letter with the Florida Public Service Commission to initiate a rate proceeding for new rates beginning in January 2026. The stability of multi-year rate plans has allowed FPL to focus on efficiency in the business, which is critical to keeping customer bills as low as possible and has enabled FPL to maintain a strong balance sheet, which allows for consistent access to the capital markets. We look forward to the opportunity to showcase our long-term track record of providing low bills and high reliability for Floridians and our plans to build an even more resilient energy future for Florida. We believe FPL is strategically well positioned as Florida remains one of the fastest growing states in the U.S. with a population growth rate that is expected to grow 60% more than the national average by 2030. We plan to meet Florida's long-term growth outlook with investments in generation, transmission and distribution infrastructure, which we believe will further enhance our best-in-class customer value proposition. Energy Resources had another record year of new renewables and storage origination, adding more than 12 gigawatts to our backlog, which includes approximately 3.3 gigawatts since our last call, a sign of the momentum of demand for new generation in renewables and storage in particular. These additions to our backlog increased 30% from the 9 gigawatts we originated in 2023, our second best year ever. To put that into context, 12 gigawatts is the size of a large utility in the U.S. Energy Resources also had a record year in solar origination and a record year in battery storage origination, again demonstrating the strong demand for renewables and storage because they are low cost and can be deployed now. Focusing for a moment on battery storage. We have deployed more than 3.4 gigawatts in total and currently have more than 7.2 gigawatts in our backlog. Our extensive portfolio of existing operating sites, which have excess transmission capacity and are nearly 30 gigawatts of standalone storage interconnection queue positions, means we can dramatically speed up our deployments, a distinct competitive advantage that no one else in this industry has. We also continue to be a leader in serving data center customers with our total renewables portfolio, including assets in operation and in backlog at 8.3 gigawatts. However, one point that I believe is being overlooked is that power demand is everywhere across all sectors and increasingly across utilities, municipalities and electric cooperatives as our 12 gigawatt year of backlog additions reflects. And as demand for power increases across all customer classes as we advance our domestic economic agenda, so does the potential price of power unless we bring new generation online quickly to meet that demand. Customers of all types are looking for low cost ways to meet their growing power needs while reducing their exposure to higher power prices over time. Given the current power demand environment, it is more important than ever to unleash all forms of electric generation, starting with renewables, which are ready now, as I will discuss more in a minute. There is no better example of this than our own portfolio. We have originated more than 3 gigawatts in three of the last five quarters and assuming we achieve the midpoint of our development expectations range, Energy Resources will be operating a roughly 75 gigawatt renewables portfolio by the end of 2027, which would be larger than the installed renewables capacity of all but seven countries. In 2024, we continue to demonstrate our leadership as a supplier of choice for buyers of new generation. We announced two framework agreements with two Fortune 50 companies that have the potential to develop renewables and storage projects totaling up to 10.5 gigawatts between now and 2030, as well as a joint development agreement with Entergy. When combined, our announced framework agreements total up to a potential 15 gigawatts, demonstrating our unique position in the market and our customers' confidence in our ability to help meet the nation's need for power. And we are not sitting still as we think about our value proposition for our customers. We are constantly looking to make sure we have the most comprehensive solution set. That is why today we are pleased to announce a framework agreement with GE Vernova, where we will partner to build natural gas powered generation solutions. This agreement has the potential to support multiple gigawatts for data centers, the reshoring of manufacturing and the electrification of industry, as well as serve investor-owned utilities, municipalities, cooperatives and commercial and industrial customers. Nobody has built more gas-fired generation over the last decade than NextEra Energy and nobody has sold more gas turbines than GE Vernova. This collaboration brings together the nation's leading operator of natural gas-fired generation and NextEra Energy and the world's leader in natural gas and electrification technology and GE Vernova to jointly develop opportunities that we believe will enable significantly more renewables to meet growing power demand by pairing low-cost renewables for energy with gas-fired generation for capacity. Over the next four years, the companies plan to collaborate to identify key locations on the energy grid that would benefit from new generation. GE Vernova will incorporate its world class natural gas generation technologies and critical electric -- electrification solutions while leveraging its financial service capabilities. NextEra Energy expects to provide customers with integrated renewable storage and gas-fired solutions for large loads, something we can uniquely deliver with our scale, experience, technology and unmatched development skills. This framework agreement is just another example of why we believe Energy Resources has the most comprehensive power generation business in the world and is better positioned than ever to capitalize on long-term growth prospects. Before I turn it over to Brian, I want to take a moment to make some comments regarding the industry as we look to the years ahead. The need to add to the country's power infrastructure is no longer in doubt. Our industry's mandate is to deliver new generation and capacity solutions at the lowest cost possible in order for the U.S. to achieve the new administration's energy dominance agenda. As a leading American energy producer, this is an agenda that we support and believe we are well-positioned to deliver on. At NextEra Energy, we know all forms of energy will be required to meet that mandate. If we don't build new generation to keep up with increasing demand for electricity, power prices are going to go up or perhaps worse, new technology or manufacturing load won't be able to connect to the grid, which would slow economic growth and we can miss opportunities to further our leadership in AI. Renewables and storage are ready now to meet that demand and will help lower power prices. Gas-fired generation is moving forward, but won't be available at scale until 2030 and then only in certain pockets of the U.S. In addition, gas-fired generation is more expensive than it's been with costs having more than doubled over the last five years due to the limited supply of gas turbines, a constrained supply chain and much higher EPC costs. Nuclear continues to be a much longer term option in our opinion, due to first of a kind risks and uncertainty with near-term opportunities centered on recommissioning and upgrade projects. Nuclear plants across the country are already serving existing demand and there are only a few nuclear plants that could be recommissioned in the near-term in an economic way. We are continuing to make progress in evaluating the recommissioning of our Duane Arnold nuclear plant in Iowa. Recently, we filed notice with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to request a licensing change, an important first step in establishing the regulatory pathway to restore the facility's operating license and potentially restart plant operations as early as the end of 2028. While this is just one part of our broader efforts with regulators, government officials, potential customers and other stakeholders, we are encouraged by the positive responses we have received so far from all parties involved. We also continue to evaluate alternatives such as SMRs. However, due to the risks and uncertainty, the practical reality is we are unlikely to add multiple gigawatts of new nuclear to the grid over the next decade. That means we need renewables and storage to meet that -- to meet demand that is here today. And as we move towards the next decade, we can supplement renewables and storage with natural gas-fired generation, and to a more limited extent, nuclear given the time it will take to develop and build. We know this because we have experience across the entire energy value chain. Our mission is to provide our customers with the lowest cost, most reliable energy no matter where they are located. We've been doing it for decades in Florida and across the country and are positioned to keep doing it for years to come. Our scale and experience tells us that all forms of power generation and capacity will be needed as the U.S. tries to keep up with demand. And that same scale and experience also tells us that renewables and storage should continue to be a critical source of new energy and capacity across the country because they are lowest cost and can be deployed now. With that, let me turn it over to Brian, who will review the 2024 results in more detail.
Brian Bolster: Thanks, John. Let's begin with FPL's detailed results. For the full year 2024, FPL's adjusted earnings per share increased $0.12 versus 2023. The principal driver of FPL's 2024 full year performance was regulatory capital employed growth of approximately 10%. We continue to expect FPL's average annual growth in regulatory capital employed to be roughly 10% over the four year term of our current rate agreement, which runs through 2025. For the full year 2024, FPL's reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.4%. During the full year 2024, we used $328 million of reserve amortization, leaving FPL with a year end 2024 balance of $895 million. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $1.8 billion in the fourth quarter, bringing its full year capital investments to a total of roughly $8.2 billion. Key indicators show that the Florida economy remains strong and Florida's population continues to be one of the fastest growing in the country. Its GDP is now roughly $1.7 trillion, an increase of approximately 7% over last year. For the fourth quarter of 2024, FPL's retail sales increased 1.1% from the prior year on a weather normalized basis, driven primarily by continued strong customer growth. In the fourth quarter of 2024, we added nearly 119,000 customers as compared to the prior year comparable quarter, bringing our total customer accounts to over 6 million. For the full year 2024, FPL's retail sales increased 1.9% from the prior year on a weather normalized basis, also driven primarily by the strong customer growth in our service territory. As John mentioned, FPL is preparing to file a base rate case proposal that would cover the four years beginning 2026 through 2029 and provide customers longer term visibility to the cost of electricity. As a reminder, for the period 2022 through the end of 2025, FPL plans to invest approximately $36 billion with additional significant investments expected in 2026 and beyond to continue to meet the growing needs of Florida's economy. This capital will allow FPL to continue delivering outstanding value for Florida customers by keeping reliability high and fuel and other costs as low as possible. While the benefit of building a stronger, smarter grid and a cleaner, more efficient generation fleet are passed along regularly to customers, through higher service reliability and lower bills, we must periodically seek recovery for these long-term investments through base rates. While the details are still being finalized, we expect the proposal to include base rate adjustments of approximately $1.55 billion starting in January of 2026 and $930 million starting in January of 2027. We also expect the proposal to request support for continued deployment of low cost generation and capacity additions and the continuation of our solar and battery base rate adjustment or SoBRA mechanism to recover the revenue requirements of these cost effective projects. FPL plans to propose an ROE midpoint at 11.9% with an allowed ROE band of plus or minus 1%. The 11.9% estimated cost of equity reflects appreciably higher interest rates and other capital markets factors we have experienced since our last rate case and which we expect to continue during the term of the proposed four year rate plan. FPL also expects to propose maintaining FPL's long standing equity ratio approved in prior base rate cases, which is intended to keep it in a position to continue to access capital as needed through 2029. We continue to believe that a strong balance sheet, which starts with an appropriate equity layer and which supports strong credit ratings remains critical to ensure FPL maintains uninterrupted access to the capital markets, even in times of significant market disruption. It also allows us to attract capital to support the investments FPL is making to further improve the value we offer customers. FPL estimates that its proposal, along with the projections for fuel and other costs, will grow a typical residential customer bill by an average annual rate of approximately 2.5% from January 2025 through 2029. If the full amount of the requests were granted under our proposal and assuming other utilities experienced bill increases only at their historical rates of increase, we expect FPL's typical customer bills will continue to remain significantly lower than the national average through 2029. To put this proposal in context, it would result in a typical customer bill in January 2026 that is nearly 21% less than it was in real terms 20 years ago, even with our proposed base rate increases. We look forward to the opportunity to present the details of our case and expect to make our formal filing with testimony and required detailed data in February. The timeline for proceeding will ultimately be determined by the commission, but we currently expect that we will have hearings in the third quarter and a final commission decision in the fourth quarter in time for new rates to go in effect in January of 2026. We're open to the possibility of resolving our rate request through a fair settlement agreement. During the course of the past 22 years, FPL has entered into five multi-year settlement agreements that have provided customers with a high degree of rate stability and certainty and helped FPL execute to deliver its best-in-class customer value proposition. Our core focus will be to pursue a fair and objective review of our case that supports continued execution of our successful strategy for customers and we plan to continue to provide updates throughout the process. Now let's turn to Energy Resources, which reported full year adjusted earnings growth of more than 13% year-over-year. For the full year, contributions from new investments increased by $0.48 per share, reflecting continued growth of demand for our renewables and storage portfolio. Contributions from existing clean energy assets increased by $0.03 per share, primarily reflecting improved wind resource during the year and the impact of certain revenue and PTC escalation benefits inherent in our existing assets. Contributions from our gas infrastructure business decreased by $0.08 per share, most of which was recognized in the second quarter. As we discussed at the time, a combination of higher depletion expense related to an expectation for lower production, certain non-recurring items and the sale of the Texas pipeline portfolio resulted in lower relative earnings in that quarter. Contributions since that time have been effectively flat, consistent with the expectations we provided in the second quarter. Our customer supply and trading business, which you will recall, had a strong earnings in 2023, decreased results by $0.04 per share, driven by normalization of origination activity and margins, which is consistent with our expectations. Other impacts decreased results by $0.24 per share year-over-year. This decline reflects higher interest cost of $0.13 per share, nearly half of which is new borrowing to support our build and half of which reflects increased borrowing costs on existing debt. Energy Resources, again, for the third year in a row delivered our best year ever for origination, adding more than 12 gigawatts of new renewables and battery storage projects to our backlog, which includes approximately 3.3 gigawatts since our last call. Our 2024 origination performance reflects continued strong demand from power and commercial and industrial customers looking for the least cost alternative to serve load and meet increasing demand. Our renewables backlog now stands at more than 25 gigawatts after taking into account roughly 2.4 gigawatts of new projects placed into service since our third quarter call. We believe our more than 25 gigawatt backlog provides terrific visibility into Energy Resources' ability to deliver attractive growth in years ahead. Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the full year, adjusted earnings per share from our Corporate and Other segment decreased by $0.01 per share year-over-year. We successfully supported the growth in our underlying businesses from our strong operating cash flows and grew 2024 cash flow from operations by more than 17%, well in excess of adjusted earnings. We also continue to focus on protecting our project economics at Energy Resources as well as minimizing the cost of refinancing at the parent. We now have $28.5 billion of interest rate hedges in place. To put this all in perspective, NextEra Energy's sensitivity for an immediate 50 basis point upward shift in the yield curve has on average $0.01 to $0.03 of expected adjusted EPS impact in 2025, 2026 and 2027, which is equivalent to less than 1% of our adjusted EPS expectations. The sensitivity, of course, assumes we do not implement other offsetting initiatives, including, among others, our normal process of cost reductions and capital efficiency opportunities. As a reminder, the current interest rate environment is taking into account in our financial expectations. Overall, our funding plans for 2024 through 2027 remain consistent with the information we shared previously. For each of the last 15 years, NextEra Energy has met or exceeded its financial expectations, which is a record we're proud of. And once again our long-term financial expectations remain unchanged. We will be disappointed if we're not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted EPS expectation ranges in 2025, 2026 and 2027. From 2023 to 2027, we continue to expect that our average annual growth and operating cash flow will be at or above our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. And we will also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at roughly 10% per year through at least 2026 off a 2024 base. As always, our expectations assume our caveats. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we will open the line for questions.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will open the line for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead with your question.
Steve Fleishman: Yeah. Hi. Good morning. Thanks. Just a couple of high level questions. So on the GEV framework agreement announcement, could you maybe give a little more color on, would you co-own projects with them and also just would you only be doing contracted projects, long-term contracts or would you consider doing kind of new build merchant like in ERCOT or PJM? Thanks on that.
John Ketchum: Steve, thanks for the question. First of all, we're very excited about this framework agreement with GE Vernova. Again, as I said in the prepared remarks, nobody has built more gas-fired generation in this country really, not only over the last decade, the last two decades than NextEra. So we've got significant experience. We have an 80 year relationship with GE, just terrific relationship, not only on the renewable side but also on the gas-fired generation side with all that we have historically done. So I think you're bringing two powerhouses together with experience in gas-fired generation. The idea would be to go after and target large load customers and do it in an integrated way where we can combine gas-fired generation with renewable battery storage solutions. And each party would bring the expertise that you would expect to the table. In terms of the ownership, yes, they would be co-owned as part of a 50-50 joint venture. These would be long-term contracted assets as well. We could contemplate in the right situation with the right customer, also potentially a build on transfer on gas-fired generation as well if it was part of a larger transaction that included renewables and other growth opportunities. But we're very excited about this. I think it enables us to bring a comprehensive solution set that is right down our alley.
Steve Fleishman: Yeah. No, it makes a lot of sense. I assume it gets you access to turbines kind of relatively quickly as well. Just one other question on, I think, we call it the elephant in the room, the new administration and just the kind of, I guess, the announcement on the wind -- limits on wind leases on federal lands and then also [Technical Difficulty] on kind of where things stand on IRA risks? Would love any commentary on those topics. Thanks.
John W. Ketchum: Sure, Steve. Let me go ahead and take that. First of all, with the executive orders as a whole, very consistent with our beliefs that we need electrons. We need electrons right now and we need to unleash the American energy industry and achieve energy dominance. So we embrace the new administration's mandates that have come out in these executive orders. And as part of achieving energy dominance, we're going to need all of the above solutions. We can't afford to take any options off the table. We're going to need gas. We're going to need nuclear. We're going to need renewables. We're going to need storage as well. But we can't wait because that demand is here today. I mean, if you think about it, power demand is higher than it's ever been in this country. The only close analogy you could draw is to the last industrial revolution. And we're expecting load demand to increase over 80% over the next five years, six-fold over the next 20 years. And if you think about generation types and needing all of the above, they're not all created equally in terms of timing, which is one of the things that I hit in my prepared remarks. Renewables are here today. You can build a wind project in 12 months, a storage facility in 15 months and a solar project in 18 months. With gas-fired generation, we're pleased with our announcement with GE Vernovo. With gas-fired generation, the country is starting from a standing start. And we've got to go find the sites. We've got to develop these sites. We've got to get gas to those sites. If we got to get hands-on gas turbines. If you take all those things together and you think about when is gas really going to be able to contribute at scale, I mean, we're looking to -- looking at 2030 and nuclear later than that. And we need shovels in the ground today because our customers need the power right now. I mean, if you think about it from a customer standpoint, they have already built new manufacturing facilities or well down the road that are going to need electrons. Our utility customers have already shut down existing generation. They're counting on these renewable projects, some of which include wind to show up to be able to provide the electrons. So we don't have reliability issues with their customers because right now, we are short power in this country. And so when I think about wind and I think about our own portfolio, we don't have any offshore wind, as you all know, we've never been in the offshore wind business. And we only -- we -- all of our onshore projects are on private land except for one. And that's a very positive fact. And the permitting process is rather limited for onshore private land solutions. And I go back to our customers' need the power right now. They're building new manufacturing. Utilities have already planned for it. And I know this administration, they support low cost energy, they support domestic job creation. So, I remain very optimistic that we're going to be able to work through any issues that may come up along the way and feel good about the future of our program.
Steve Fleishman: Great. Thank you very much.
John Ketchum: And Steve, on IRA, let me hit your last one on IRA. That's really a lot of...
Steve Fleishman: Okay. Yeah.
John Ketchum: That's really a lot of the same points. I mean, obviously, we've been spending a lot of time in Washington on advocacy around IRA. And what I will say there is, again, it's all about electrons and needing electrons right now. The power demand is here today. We need to serve it. Renewables pay -- play a very important role in all forms of energy solution. We're going to need gas to back up renewables. We'll have nuclear, later next decade. But right now, if we need solutions that are going to deliver electrons to the grid, so we don't have a power crisis. And that is the thing that is not being overlooked at all by folks that we are meeting with in Congress. And then there's the other factor that, look, this is a terrific American industry. We are creating a substantial number of jobs right here in our backyard and 80% of those jobs are -- and investments are incurring in Republican states. Take our own CapEx. We've been top five infrastructure investor over the last five years, fully expect that to be the case over the next four years. NextEra is going to invest $120 billion over the next four years. That's our expectation. And again, 80% of those dollars is going into Republican states, that’s a lot of manufacturing, a lot of job creation, a lot of property taxes, a lot of economic benefits. So those are the messages that we're trying to make sure we get across in Washington around the IRA discussion.
Steve Fleishman: Great. Very helpful. Thank you.
John Ketchum: Thank you, Steve.
Operator: Our next question comes from Shahriar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead with your question.
Shahriar Pourreza: Hey, guys. Good morning.
John Ketchum: Good morning, Shar.
Shahriar Pourreza: Good morning. Just real quick, John, I know you noted the time to market for nuclear is between the '27 and '30 timeframe. I guess, where does Duane Arnold fall within that timeframe? And also, there's obviously one restart out there and there's a cost estimate. Is there anything you can provide just directionally for Duane Arnold restart versus the comp that's out there? And would you potentially look to expand the site if there's support from a counterparty or the federal government? Thanks.
John Ketchum: Yeah. Hey, thanks, Shar, for the question. So, happy to say that we have made our filing with the NRC around the licensing to recommission that facility. We have more work to do. Some of that work includes work with customers. I'm certainly not going to put the cost estimate out there that would hurt our negotiating position in those discussions. And you could rest assured that we are in active discussions with customers today. There's a lot of interest in the plant as we look forward. But my comments around nuclear are really, look as one of the largest nuclear operators in the country, we obviously know a lot about it. I think the near-term opportunities are around the recommissioning with Palisades of Crane (ph) of Duane Arnold as well. And those are really the ones that I think I would confine to the timeframe of being over the next three, four, five years. As you think about next decade, and my comments around next decade, those are really more around the small module reactors, which are still a first of a kind technology have some uncertainty in terms of developing and permitting and the ability of them to be able to be delivered to market on-time and on-schedule. And so as we think about small module reactors and we have a team internally at NextEra Energy that is focusing on nothing, but small modular reactors. We'd love to be able to develop them. But as we get into them, there are some practical limitations. So if we're thinking as a country about their ability to contribute to all the power demand that we see that's here right now, my only comment is that I would think about them more as a next decade solution probably middle of the latter part of the next decade if we're thinking about small modular reactors at scale and cost continues to remain a wildcard.
Shahriar Pourreza: Got it. Maybe just -- I'll just ask in a slightly different way. Just what's the condition of the plant right now, I guess, on Duane Arnold?
John Ketchum: The Duane Arnold plan is really in good shape. I mean, the only issue that we had -- if I think about the facility and the condition that it's in, I mean, I think about the reactor itself and very good condition. The only damage that we ever sustained at Duane Arnold was a derecho that took down the cooling tower, but building a cooling tower is run of the mill. I mean, you build them at gas plants, you build them at nuclear facilities as well. So that's pretty conventional construction, so not a whole lot of risk there.
Shahriar Pourreza: Got it. That's perfect. And then just lastly on, just to follow up on Steve's gas question there. 2030 plus, just to me, seems a little far out just given the hyperscalers' needs, including just the trends around additionality and speed to market. I think supply chain should start to ease in the next couple of years. I guess, just directionally, this could be pretty, I guess, a quite sizable opportunity for NextEra. I guess, when can this sort of start to become accretive to growth and hit the backlog? Thanks.
John Ketchum: Yeah. Hey, thanks, Shar for the question. So my comments on gas are, when you look at finding a site, getting it permitted, getting gas to the facility, getting it interconnected and then the equipment limitations of actually getting a turbine slot, getting access to that turbine and then the EPC labor. Remember, we -- this is an industry that really hasn't seen any active development or construction in years. And so that's my comment earlier about really beginning from a standing start. And so, all of that puts pressure on cost. I mean, we've seen enormous demand, as you know, from GE Vernova's commentary for gas turbines and it's not only domestic, it's international and that's more than double the cost of a gas turbine. And EPC labor is in such short supply that the costs there have tripled. And I look back to just our last gas-fired facility that we built here in Florida, Dania Beach. If we take the cost we paid for that facility on a dollar per KW basis to today, I mean, we -- the cost has tripled in price. And so, those are some of the sensitivity. So it's not only time, but it's money as well and making sure that we can put an economic solution in front of the customer in terms of when it contributes, consistent with that timeframe. I mean, I think it's the that 2030 and beyond timeframe. And don't get me wrong, there are probably some pockets of the country that would be an exception. ERCOT, you can build more quickly than you can in other parts of the country. Other parts of the country are just more difficult, right, because you have to deal with courts. We know from our own experience with what it took to get the MVP pipeline built in the Mid-Atlantic region if you think about PJM, in particular. It's just not easy to get the gas to those facilities and to get gas infrastructure built. This new administration certainly is undoubtedly going to move forward with reforms that will make that easier to achieve, but there could be litigation over those things as well. So as we put all the pieces together, we're just being practical, we're just being realistic, we see it more as a later this decade solution.
Shahriar Pourreza: Fantastic. Thanks again, John. Send my best to the team. Appreciate it.
John Ketchum: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey. Good morning, team. Thank you guys very much. Appreciate it. Hey, so maybe to follow-up a little bit on some of the core questions here. How do you think about getting into this gas business? I know you talked about development kind of in the 2030 plus. Any thoughts about strategically entering into it in a proactive way from an acquisition perspective to create some origination prospects right to leverage off of? And then related, how are you thinking about this XPLR pivot and having sort of a development sell down partner? I note, for instance, your comment earlier about a 50-50 development effort with GV using their financial services effort. How do you think about the renewable side of that equation in terms of no longer having the same sell down vehicles you did before? Thoughts about the monetization factor?
John Ketchum: Yeah. Let me take those in pieces. So if I think about the gas business and your question about whether or not we would look to do something through an acquisition, I don't think we need to do that. And here's why we don't need to do that Julien is, we are a giant development company, right, that is our business. We are a massive development company that's been up and running for the better part of a couple of decades. We have all the pieces in place already. We have a land team. We have a permitting team. We have gas infrastructure, capability to build gas pipeline laterals, to build new gas pipelines. We have a transmission business. There wouldn't be a whole lot to be gained for us adding a piece but through an acquisition. Given that we already have all those components in place internally, it's an easy pivot for us to move into gas and we've already been up and running in that and already have put together a nice pipeline and we'll continue to grow that as we move forward. On the XPLR side, I really don't want to answer any questions about XPLR on this call, given that we have a call scheduled for Tuesday, but I will answer your question about sell-down vehicles and recycling capital generically for NextEra Energy. I think, as you can see with the reaffirmation of our capital recycling plan and our equity plan that we've included in today's call, there are no changes, right? No changes at all. And so we feel good about where we are in terms of our ability to recycle capital, and it has no impact again on our equity needs. And we have plenty of outlets available to be able to do that, whether that would be through XPLR or some other avenue, as we've talked about in the past.
Brian Bolster: Julien, I'd just remind you that over the past, 18, 24 months, we've recycled several billion dollars of capital that had nothing to do with XPLR. So, not only are we very comfortable with our expectations, we've been recycling capital now for a good several years through other avenues.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yeah. All right, indeed. All righty. Well, best of luck here. Appreciate it. Talk to you soon.
John Ketchum: Julien, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nick Campanella from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.
Nick Campanella: Hey, good morning. Thanks for all the updates. So hey, just a 2% change to customers for FPL in this upcoming rate case definitely stands out in a positive way. Just wanted to see if you had any updated thoughts on how you're thinking about the surplus reserve mechanism? And then also just how are you kind of thinking about earned ROEs at FPL in '25? Thanks.
John Ketchum: Great. Thank you. So we are -- the growth that we saw this last quarter, the growth that we saw in the year was certainly positive. But it's not just this past year, we've been seeing it really since the pandemic. Our expectations going into the next rate case over the next four years is that growth may come down a little bit over the next four years because of what we saw during the pandemic. But we still believe it's going to be fairly strong growth in our service territory. And that's why our expectations for the '26, '29 time period for capital investing in the business would be above the roughly $36 billion that we are going to put in over the four year settlement agreement that ends at the end of '25. So a lot of that detail will come out here in the next -- that's probably about six weeks now because we expect to file our rate case at the end of February. Your question regarding the reserve mechanism. We're sitting at roughly $800 million after using $400 million or so in 2024. So we feel good. We're certainly not going into 2025 believing that all of the risks that we use as the surplus mechanism are behind us. We've had to tap that reserve mechanism for a lot of inflation, higher interest rates, a lot more growth in our area, and therefore, a lot more capex expenses that we expected. So with the 11.4% ROE at the end of 2024, I expect there might be a little bit of upside to that 11.4% in 2025, but it's obviously early. We want to make sure that we get through this year in good shape. And we feel really positive about the case that we are going to present to our regulators in February because we've been doing the right things for our customers. So as long as we do that, I think we'll be okay.
Nick Campanella: Hey, thanks for all that information. And then, I'm sorry, but just a follow-up on XPLR. Just you're still including the proportional share of EBITDA and earnings in your own outlook from NEE perspective. And I just wanted to confirm that you just continue to see that income stream consistent and preserved kind of regardless of the outcome. Thanks.
Brian Bolster: Just say that the accounting is unchanged around XPLR and we'll discuss the outlook for that business on Tuesday.
Nick Campanella: All right. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Carly Davenport from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.
Carly Davenport: Hey, good morning. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Just wanted to throw in a couple of follow-ups. The first one just on some of the renewables conversation. Is there anything you can share on how this is or is not impacting the conversations that you're having with customers? Are they seeing any concern about the ability to build these projects or the economics of them going forward if you see some change on the policy side?
John Ketchum: So, Carly, the answer to that question is, no, it hasn't hurt any of our discussions with customers. The only thing customers are concerned about is, making sure that these projects get built because they need them. They have made decisions to already shut down existing generation if these projects were for any reason to be delayed, which we don't believe they will be, that would have a significant impact on their ability to provide power to their own customer base. I'm talking about utilities and co-ops and municipalities who need these electrons right now. And then also with our C&I customers. I mean, these commercial and industrial customers have made investments in manufacturing facilities, semiconductor chip facilities, their chemical companies, I mean, you name it. Across the board, they've invested in infrastructure and are counting on the electrons to show up. So I think it's actually quite the opposite.
Rebecca Kujawa: I'd echo that and we've had quite a number of conversations just this week with customers across the board that John just mentioned and top of mind to them is time and money. They don't have time to get other resources available to them in the timeframes that they need and they know that without these renewable resources, storage resources or other things that they have in the queue, it would cost more money and cost more money for their end customers. So top of mind to them to make sure that we meet the demands of the day and we're excited to work with them and all the stakeholders to make sure that happens.
Carly Davenport: Great. Really appreciate that color. And then maybe just one on the rate side, it's become a little more topical in our conversations. Can you just refresh us on the broader interest rate hedge program? It looks like some of the interest rate sensitivities moved just a bit relative to prior disclosure. So just can you refresh us on the strategy to manage rates exposure?
John Ketchum: Yeah. So, Carly, we put $32 billion of interest rate swaps in place with an average coupon of around 3.9%. So we feel very good about our hedge position and that shows up in what we communicated today. So if you look at our sensitivities for '25 and '26, it's about $0.01 to $0.03 on an EPS basis. If you look at '27, it's $0.03 to $0.05. So very manageable and we keep a very close eye on interest rate risk exposure around the portfolio, but feel good where we are with the $32 billion of interest rate swaps in place.
Carly Davenport: Great. Thanks so much for the time.
John Ketchum: Thank you, Carly.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet from JP Morgan. Please go ahead with your question.
Jeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning.
John Ketchum: Good morning.
Jeremy Tonet: Just wanted to continue with some of the themes you talked about before, but regarding your conversations with hyperscalers at this point, just wondering if you're seeing any kind of changes in the tone or thoughts as far as the renewables, clearly still carbon-free premiums there, but as far as openness to gas, just wondering if there's any change in tone there or thoughts in your -- from your customers when you're talking about their -- what they're looking to achieve.
Rebecca Kujawa: Yeah. There's -- thanks for the question, Jeremy. I certainly appreciate it. And I think there's a lot of discussion about how do we get the resources that we need in the timeframes in which we need it and matching that with some of the other goals that they may have either at corporate levels or certainly state levels. I think top of mind continues to be what John highlighted, which is speed to market with the resources that are available today at the lowest cost with highest confidence and be able to meet those commitments, including the meet the commitments of those customers. So, we see demand across the board where we've seen a lot of increase in demand for natural gas, it really is to enable that capacity value where energy still can be met in many places, least cost in terms of resource availability from wind and solar resources. So there's a great pairing there that many of our customers are really interested in. So it's a real pragmatic view. I think it can't be underestimated how much this industry has changed in a very short amount of time and really the last 15 months to 18 months realizing that demand is significant. You all are well-versed in knowing that it takes three years to five years to develop resources. And we've talked a lot about demand, but it takes time to build all this back up. So what's available? As John highlighted, the renewables and storage is top of mind. What will be needed longer-term are making sure that the capacity resources are there. And of course, we and others are very interested in seeing continued diverse supply options available to our customers, including small module reactors and other technologies that we hope to be more relevant and at bigger scale in the 2030 mid-timeframe and beyond.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. That's very helpful there. I didn't know if behind-the-meter gas was coming up in conversation at all versus prior conversations.
Rebecca Kujawa: It does, Jeremy. I think there's a novelness to that about whether or not that can work and speed through some of these other issues. But you got to think about what does it take to produce reliable energy supply behind-the-meter without the benefit of a grid. And it's significantly more capacity and other things you need to add to it in order to ensure that you have that uninterrupted supply that these customers are looking for. So in mega scale projects, we certainly see the possibility that some of these could be developed and we've had some conversations with customers along those lines. But I don't know that that's going to be the prevalent way that resources are met across the country for a variety of different customer scenarios. There's a huge value to the existing electric grid. There's no place better to see that than here in Florida and the low cost power supply solutions that we can offer to our customers. So there's a place for it. I don't think it's the ultimate place where all demand is met, but customers need options, they need them now and we're here to provide that broad set of solutions to make that happen.
Jeremy Tonet: Very helpful. Thanks. And if I could, just one last quick one on XPLR. Thanks for your thoughts so far. Just wondering if you could provide incremental thoughts from a NEE perspective, non-XPLR perspective, we would expect to hear that on Tuesday, but just as far as NEE views to XPLR, is there any change in the strategic -- how it fits into NEE strategic outlook going forward at this point?
Brian Bolster: Jeremy, we're going to have a full conversation around XPLR on Tuesday. So why don't we plan on having that conversation then?
Jeremy Tonet: Fair enough. Thank you.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, with that, we're going to end today's question-and-answer session as well as today's conference call. We do thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-10-23 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the NextEra Energy Inc. and NextEra Energy Partners LP Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mark Edelman, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Mark Edelman : Thank you, Dave. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter 2024 combined financial results conference call for NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. With me this morning are John Ketchum, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; Brian Bolster, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; Rebecca Kujawa, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources; and Mark Hickson, Executive Vice President of NextEra Energy. All of whom are also officers of NextEra Energy Partners as well as Armando Pimentel, President and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light Company. John will start with opening remarks and then Brian will provide an overview of our results. Our executive team will then be available to answer your questions. We will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call and the Risk Factors section of the accompanying presentation or in our latest report and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found on our website, www.nexteraenergy.com and www.nexteraenergypartners.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. Today's presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of historical non-GAAP measures to the closest GAAP financial measure. With that, I'll turn the call over to John.
John Ketchum : Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy delivered strong third quarter results and remains well positioned to meet its overall objectives for the year. Adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter increased approximately 10% year-over-year, reflecting continued solid financial and operating -- operational performance at both FPL and Energy Resources. As a sign of the robust underlying demand for new renewables generation and storage, we are pleased to announce that for the second quarter in a row, we have added approximately 3 gigawatts to our backlog, bringing our running four quarter total to approximately 11 gigawatts. We are also pleased to announce incremental framework agreements with two Fortune 50 customers for the potential development of renewables and storage projects, totaling up to 10.5 gigawatts between now and 2030, none of which is in our backlog today. When combined with our Entergy joint development agreement from last quarter, our recent announced framework agreements now totaled up to a potential 15 gigawatts, demonstrating our unique position in the market and our customers' confidence in our ability to help meet the nation's need for power. Before I turn it over to Brian to take you through the detailed results, I want to spend a moment on FPL and Hurricanes Helene and Milton. I then will discuss our view of the industry at this transformative time. I would like to extend our deepest sympathies to all those who have been affected by the widespread destruction caused by these two hurricanes over the last month. Hurricane Helene was one of the most destructive hurricanes to ever make landfall in the continental United States. The powerful and destructive storm hit Florida as a high end Category 4 hurricane, with devastating storm surges and sustained winds of approximately 140 miles per hour, causing approximately 680,000 FPL customers to lose power. Hurricane Milton made landfall in Florida as a high end Category 3 hurricane, with sustained winds of approximately 120 miles per hour, producing numerous tornadoes, widespread flooding, and causing approximately 2 million FPL customers to lose power. Hurricane Milton made landfall on the West Coast of Florida in FPL service territory in Sarasota County and exited on the East Coast of Florida in FPL service territory in Brevard County. In preparation for the hurricanes, FPL assembled a combined restoration workforce of more than 30,000 workers across these two storms. This preparation and coordinated response enabled FPL to restore service to roughly 95 affected customers after the second full day of restoration following Hurricane Helene's landfall and 95% of affected customers after the fourth full day of restoration following Hurricane Milton's landfall. I would like to thank all of our employees who made personal sacrifices leaving their own homes to serve our customers, our communities and our state. It was because of their training, their preparation, their dedication and their commitment that we were able to restore power to our customers so quickly. I would also like to thank other members of the restoration team, including the contractors, vendors and first responders that supported our efforts for their dedicated assistance during this critical time. Finally, I would like to express our sincere gratitude to Governor DeSantis for his unwavering leadership and support during these devastating hurricanes. We're also deeply grateful for the resources provided by our industry partners, who came from 41 different states in Canada to help support our customers during Hurricane Helene and Milton. Mutual aid in times of disaster was one of the hallmarks of our industry and we were proud to be able to assist other utilities to help rebuild some of the damaged southeastern power grid that saw significant impacts from Hurricane Helene in Georgia and the Carolinas. For nearly two decades, FPL has invested significantly in building a stronger, smarter and more storm resilient grid. The performance of our system demonstrates that FPL's hardening, undergrounding, automation and smart grid investments are providing significant benefits to our customers. During sustained winds of approximately 140 miles per hour during Hurricane Helene and 120 miles per hour during Hurricane Milton, our smart grid technology investments avoided 185,000 outages during Hurricane Helene and avoided 554,000 outages during Hurricane Milton. Additionally, initial performance data shows that FPL's underground distribution power lines perform more than 6x better in terms of outage rates than existing overhead distribution power lines in Florida. We are proud to report that our generation fleet, including our solar sites, sustained no significant damage. Despite 66 of FPL's 88 existing solar sites or approximately 16 million panels being exposed to storm conditions during Hurricanes Helene and Milton, less than 0.05% of our solar panels were affected. We believe these investments, together with our preparation and coordinated response have improved FPL's overall reliability and resiliency, providing significant value to our customers. The recent storms underscore the importance of a reliable and resilient power grid and this need will only intensify, as we face a period of unprecedented growth in power demand. Over the last 80 years, our sector has experienced many demand cycles from growth emerging out of the World War 2 and the Industrial Revolution to multiple decades of essentially little to flat demand. That's all changed. Today, there are forecasts for an approximate 6x increase in power demand growth in the next 20 years versus the prior 20. That significant projected shift in fundamental demand is across industries, driven in large part by 7/24 loads from data centers, reshoring to manufacturing and electrification of industry, including oil and gas and chemicals to name a few. U.S. data center power demand alone is expected to increase substantially, adding approximately 460 terawatt hours of new electricity demand at a compound annual growth rate of 22% from 2023 to 2030, which could potentially enable 150 gigawatts of new renewables and storage demand over the same period. With all of that demand -- with all of that power demand, it's important to consider what it will take to meet that demand, what type of generation will be required over the next decade or so, and importantly, when can it practically be brought to market? If that demand is not met in a smart prudent way, power prices could escalate over time and affordability could become an increasing concern, driving inflation and making U.S. industry uncompetitive on a global scale. Fortunately, at FPL, we have a playbook in place. We have been addressing the benefits and challenges of fundamental growth for years now, while continuing to deliver on our strong customer value proposition, which is anchored in bills that are nearly 40% below the national average and maintaining top decile reliability. We are making smart capital investments in low cost solar generation and battery storage, which are continuing to reduce our overall fuel cost and when combined with generation modernizations, have saved customers nearly $16 billion since 2001. We are delivering best-in-class non-fuel O&M, where we're 70% better than the national average, saving our customers $3 billion every year compared to the average utility. Our experience at FPL puts Energy Resources in a unique position to help our customers meet their power demands. We know what it is going to take to successfully meet the challenge that is in front of our industry. We need low cost reliable energy that can also deliver the capacity needed to support grid and we need it now. Cost, capacity and speed are the three big issues that need to be addressed in meeting power demand. And as we have demonstrated in Florida, a mix of new renewable storage and gas generation is the solution. When it comes to economics, renewables and storage are the lowest cost generation and capacity resource for customers in many parts of the U.S. We believe new wind is up to 60% cheaper and new solar up to 40% cheaper than new gas power generation, and that's on a nearly firm basis when paired with a 4 hour battery. Incentives for wind, solar, and storage flow directly to customers in the form of lower bills. Over the past several years, we have seen the customer benefits of low cost solar and storage at FPL, where the two combined resources are currently the lowest cost option for customers, beating out new build gas and combined cycle units in our 10 year site plan. As a result, FPL now has the largest utility owned solar portfolio in the country. What FPL is seeing in Florida is also playing out across the rest of the country, whether with investor owned utilities, municipalities, cooperatives or commercial and industrial customers. And when it comes to speed to market, no technology is quicker to deploy than renewables and storage. Wind, solar and storage not only can be built quicker, but they're already in the interconnection queue. But don't just take our word for it, look at our backlog. We've added another approximately 3 gigawatts of renewables and storage this quarter, our second quarter in a row. As a top operator of all forms of power generation, we often get asked about nuclear and gas. Let me start with nuclear. Nuclear will play a role, but there are some practical limitations. Remember, on a national level, we expect we are going to need to add 900 gigawatts of new generation to the grid by 2040. There are only a few nuclear plants that can be recommissioned in an economic way. We are currently evaluating the recommissioning of our Duane Arnold nuclear plant in Iowa as one example. But even with a 100% success rate on those recommissionings, we would still only meet less than 1% of that demand. Existing merchant nuclear generation is also limited in its ability to meet that demand, given there are only approximately 20 merchant nuclear plants in this country. That nuclear capacity is also not evenly spread across the U.S. And is not in many places. We know hyperscalers are looking to develop data centers or manufacturing -- manufacturers are looking to expand their footprint. For example, there are only two merchant nuclear plants west of the Mississippi. Nuclear plants across the country are already serving existing demand. So even if they are contracted by specific customers, new resources need to be built to meet new demand. And alternatives such as new utility scale nuclear and SMRs are unproven, expensive and again, not expected to be commercially viable at scale until the latter part of the next decade. Turning to gas, when it comes to gas power generation, nobody has built more over the last two decades in NextEra Energy. We understand the benefits and the challenges and we know what it all costs and how long it takes to build. The power sector is going to need to build more gas power generation and battery storage to meet growing capacity needs over the next decade. And as we build more, we also enable more renewables to come to market as the lowest cost generation source of energy. Renewables will be built for energy and battery storage and gas for capacity. That being said, while we are going to need both, storage has an advantage because it's ready now as it can be paired with renewables at the same interconnect and there are no wait times or permitting hurdles for batteries. And renewables and storage will only get cheaper and cheaper over time, and we believe will continue to make up the lion's share of new additions over the long haul. To summarize, we believe power demand is at an inflection point and we expect much of that demand to be met by renewables and storage because they're low cost, fast to deploy and in the transmission queue now. And the potential opportunity is significant. Forecasts are projecting a tripling in renewables growth over the next seven years compared to what we've seen over the prior seven. No one is better positioned to capitalize on that demand growth in NextEra Energy, and we have the track record to prove it. Since 2021 at Energy Resources, we have originated more than 33 gigawatts of renewables and storage, while placing nearly 18 gigawatts into commercial operation. We have advanced from originating on average 8 gigawatts per year from 2021 to 2023 to approximately 11 gigawatts over the last four quarters. If we achieve the midpoint of our development expectations, this pace of development is expected to more than double our combined renewable generation portfolio, growing from 38 gigawatts today to potentially 81 gigawatts by the end of 2027. It's hard to overstate the advantage this would give us as we head into the end of the decade. This potential growth in the portfolio would enable a long-term co-located storage opportunity set of more than 50 gigawatts by the end of 2027, creating a meaningful opportunity for us to win new business and continue to deliver superior returns. Our new framework agreements with Fortune 50 companies as well as our Entergy joint development agreement announced last quarter, together with our continued origination success are key examples of our leadership in power generation. While these additions clearly demonstrate that some of the most sophisticated customers in the country understand the value proposition of renewables and storage, I want to close with a reminder of the broader economic impact to build out of renewables has had and continues to have on the U.S. economy. We have invested tens of billions of dollars in the nation's energy infrastructure, creating tens of thousands of jobs, increased tax revenues and economic stimulus for the communities we invest in. And we are powering millions of American homes and businesses with low cost, reliable and clean electricity. The fact is that renewables are a critical part of the energy infrastructure in this country. Wind, solar and storage are not only ready now and fast to deploy, but also present a cost effective solution for meeting our country's energy needs. Tens of thousands of good jobs have already been created with many more yet to come over the next several years, boosting manufacturing and helping to revitalize rural communities across America. With scale, experience and technology across the energy value chain, and sites ready to develop and interconnect today, NextEra Energy was built for this moment. With that, I will turn the call over to Brian to cover the detailed results.
Brian Bolster : Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter of 2024, FPL increased earnings per share by $0.05 year-over-year. The principal driver of this performance was FPL's regulatory capital employed growth of approximately 9.5% year-over-year. We continue to expect FPL to realize roughly 10% average annual growth in regulatory capital employed over our current rate agreements four year term, which runs through 2025. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $2 billion for the quarter, and we expect FPL's full year 2024 capital investment to be between $8 billion and $8.8 billion. Over the current four year settlement agreement, we expect FPL's capital investments to exceed $34 billion. FPL's third quarter retail sales increased 1% from the prior year comparable period. FPL grew retail sales by roughly 1.6% on a weather normalized basis, offset by milder weather. During the quarter, FPL reversed approximately $231 million of reserve amortization and FPL ended the quarter with a balance of roughly $817 million. With regard to costs associated with storm recovery, as a reminder, we have both the storm reserve and a surcharge mechanism to the extent the reserve has been fully utilized. Following Hurricane Debby, we had depleted our storm reserve and have deferred the remaining incremental cost for Hurricanes Debby, Helene and Milton to the balance sheet. We intend to recover those deferred costs and replenish the storm reserve via storm surcharge on customers' bills over the calendar year 2025. Although FPL has not completed the final accounting, our preliminary estimate of restoration costs that we plan to recover from customers through a surcharge is approximately $1.2 billion inclusive of $150 million, which will be utilized to replenish the storm reserve. Of course, the restoration cost will be subject to a final review and prudence determination by the Florida Public Service Commission. For the 12 months ending September 2024, FPL's reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.8%. We still expect the regulatory ROE for the 12 months ending December 2024 and 2025 to be 11.4%. Now let's turn to Energy Resources, which reported adjusted earnings growth of approximately 11% year-over-year. At Energy Resources, adjusted earnings per share increased by $0.04 year-over-year. Contributions from new investments increased $0.15 per share year-over-year, primarily driven by continued growth in our renewables portfolio. Comparative contribution from our customer supply and trading business, which you'll recall had strong earnings last year, decreased by $0.10 per share driven by normalization of origination activity and margins, which is consistent with our expectations. Contributions from both NextEra Energy transmission and gas infrastructure businesses increased by $0.01 per share year-over-year. All other impacts reduced earnings by $0.03 per share. Energy Resources had another strong quarter of new renewables and storage origination, adding approximately 3 gigawatts to the backlog. With these additions, our backlog now totals over 24 gigawatts after taking into account roughly 1 gigawatt of new projects placed into service since our last earnings call, providing great visibility into Energy Resources' ability to deliver on our development program expectations. We expect the backlog additions will go into service over the next several years. Turning now to our third quarter 2024 consolidated results, adjusted EPS was $1.03 per share. Adjusted earnings from corporate and other were flat to last year's comparable quarter. At NextEra Energy, our long-term financial expectations remain unchanged. We will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted EPS expectation ranges in 2024, 2025, 2026 and 2027. In 2023 to 2027, we continue to expect that our average annual growth in operating cash flow will be at or above our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. And we also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at roughly 10% per year through at least 2026 off a base -- off a 2024 base. As a reminder, our expectations are subject to our caveats. Turning to NextEra Energy Partners. Yesterday, NextEra Energy Partners board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.9175 per common unit or $3.67 per common unit on an annualized basis, up nearly 6% from a year earlier. Today, NextEra Energy Partners is pleased to announce the expected wind repowering of another approximately 225 megawatts of wind facilities, bringing its total backlog of wind repowering to approximately 1.6 gigawatts through 2026. The partnership's organic growth opportunities have expanded and we are increasing our wind repowering target to approximately 1.9 gigawatts of wind projects owned by NextEra Energy Partners through 2026, which is up from the previous target of 1.3 gigawatts. NextEra Energy Partners owns a large portfolio of high quality long-term contracted clean energy assets and has attractive organic growth from the repowering of its existing portfolio. NextEra Energy Partners remains focused on executing additional wind repowering opportunities in the future, which we believe would provide improved operating performance and higher generation. Let me now turn to the detailed results. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $453 million and cash available for distribution was $155 million. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution declined by approximately $35 million and $92 million respectively from the same period last year. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution reflect the year-over-year impact of the divestiture of the Texas Pipeline portfolio. In addition, third quarter cash available for distribution in 2024 was negatively impacted by the first interest payment on the partnership's December 2023 HoldCo debt issuance, as well as $23 million of higher project level debt service relating in large part to the 2023 acquisition financing. NextEra Energy Partners continue to expect the run rate contribution for adjusted EBITDA from its forecasted portfolio at December 31, 2024 to be in the range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion. The year end 2024 run rate projections reflect expected calendar year 2025 contributions from the forecasted portfolio at year end 2024. The partnership also continues to evaluate alternatives to address its remaining convertible equity portfolio financing obligations and its cost of capital, focusing on its capital structure and the potential for redeployment of more cash flow toward driving organic cash flow growth. Given the demand for power, NextEra Energy Partners has many ways in which it can seek to grow, which could include not only acquiring assets, but also wind repowerings and potential other organic growth opportunities. NextEra Energy Partners plans to complete its review by no later than the fourth quarter 2024 call and intends to provide its distribution and run rate cash available for distribution expectations at that time. As a reminder, our expectations are subject to our caveats. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we will open the line for questions.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.
Steve Fleishman: Maybe if it's possible, I would love to get more color on the framework agreements. And I think when Brookfield announced one of these with Microsoft, you kind of downplayed wanting to do things in a framework fashion just due to the fact that you wanted to maximize the value of each site. So, could you maybe talk to the change in kind of now having framework agreements?
John Ketchum : Yes, sure, Steve. This is John. First of all, the framework agreements that we have been able to strike with Entergy and with the two Fortune 50 companies that we mentioned that total over 10.5 gigawatts and 4.5 on the Entergy side, give us an enormous amount of flexibility in terms of which assets that we allocate towards those programs. And so, we're not stuck tying up inventory. And it creates a close partnership arrangement with each of these three counterparties that gives us a huge leg up in being able to secure incremental business. And what we would look for on the Entergy side, for example, is kind of a 50-50 on BOTs and PPAs, but I would think what we're doing with the framework agreements with the Fortune 50 customers would be more in the lines of power purchase agreements. I'll turn it over to Rebecca to see if she has anything to add.
Rebecca Kujawa: Sure, Steve. I think if you take a step back and you think about what's happening in our industry, and you know as well as many of us on the call, the change in demand is significant. And it has changed rapidly over the last couple of years. And the customers that we're referencing today as well as quite a number of others with whom we're in discussions with have big, important and urgent energy needs that they need to have visibility to how those are going to be met. And they want to make sure that we and they are aligned, so that they have access to our substantial pipeline of projects. You know very well there is no one else out there that has a pipeline of 100 of gigawatts of projects in various stages of development. There's no one out there that has 150 gigawatts interconnect queue positions ready to go. And these customers want to make sure we're focused on their business. And how do we do that? We get visibility to what their needs are so that we're working with them collaboratively, so that ultimately we can work to put these projects into the backlog. I think the biggest takeaway that I would have if I were in your shoes is that this is a sign of how we are differentiated from others, and how we're getting incremental visibility to the significant demand that's related to the characteristics that we all know well. And I think it's also a great sign of what John and Brian just went through about specifically the demand for renewables. Low cost, ready to deploy and aligned with the goals and objectives of the customers with which we're working. I think it's just one more sign of the great environment in which we're operating.
Steve Fleishman: And maybe just a follow-up or two on this still. Is there a point in time when you'll be able to disclose who these agreements are with? And obviously, you can't do that now, but just are -- is it fair to say these are both hyperscalar tech type customers or other industries?
John Ketchum : So, I'll take the first one, Steve. Is there a point of time where we can give names? Probably. And I think the preference of the counterparties and our preference is to go ahead and make an announcement of who they are side by side with the transaction, once we bring a deal to the table with them. And Rebecca, you want to handle the second question?
Rebecca Kujawa: Yes. I think the second part of it, and we were careful to write Fortune 50 companies. These are not technology companies. And I think that's another great point is, yes, absolutely we're so many of us are talking about demand from hyperscalers and colocation datacenter developers and that demand is real and significant and we're having quite a number of conversations with all of them. But these are actually with customers that are outside of the technology industry. They are folks that are building facilities that they need to get power to. They are folks that are concerned and care about ensuring that they are low cost, ready to deploy and ideally low carbon forms of energy and capacity. So I think this is again robust sign of significant broad based demand.
John Ketchum : And one thing I'll add to that, Steve, which I think is important color as investors think about the value proposition that we have going forward, given all of the demand that we're seeing from data centers, it's actually and the compression of supply and available sites ready to go. It's creating more -- even more of a premium on other industries outside of data centers to try to lock up low-cost renewable generation. And so, all ships are rising with the tide here, so to speak. So as data centers are increasing their demand, which is also increasing price, which is also increasing returns, you're also seeing other industries that are looking to secure and hedge their power exposure because they believe that power prices, they may be facing higher power prices down the road. And so it's kind of an across sector phenomenon that we're seeing, and it's so encouraging because it's very consistent with what we've been saying that this is not just the data center movement. This is a movement across industry, the electrification of industry, manufacturing, looking to decouple from China, and they're all looking for ways to control energy prices at the lowest cost possible going forward.
Steve Fleishman: Last quick question. Just on the Duane Arnold. Is there any milestones or key steps that we should be watching out for on that opportunity?
John Ketchum : Yes. So we are very busy looking at Duane Arnold. We're very interested in recommissioning the plant. We're doing all the things right now that you would expect us to do. We're doing all the assessments, which include engineering assessments, includes working with the NRC. It includes working with local stakeholders. So we are continuing to advance that project. And they're obviously -- it goes without saying there's very strong interest from customers, really data center customers, in particular, around that site. But we will keep all of you posted as our evaluation progresses.
Operator: Next question comes from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.
Shahriar Pourreza: Just on Steve's question on Duane Arnold. I guess, John, any sort of sense on the cost to restart that plant and other structural items we should be thinking about as you approach a decision? And ultimately, if you strike a contract with a counterparty, is this an asset you'd want to own over the long-term? Or could that be a monetization opportunity as we're thinking about your kind of ongoing balance sheet needs?
John Ketchum : Yes. Sure. I'll start with the first one and then go to the second. So I'm not going to give you a cost number yet because that's part of the evaluation that we're going through currently. Remember, this is a BWR, boiling water reactor. They are a lot less complex to bring back and to recommission. It's a simpler design because they don't have a steam generator like PWRs do. And so that gives us optimism at being able to do this at an attractive price and be able to execute it without as much risk that might be associated with recommissioning a plant that does not have a boiling water reactor, but is a PWR design. On the second question, our desires to own versus monetize. For us, look, I mean, this is be a very attractive asset to own. We would hope to be able to get an attractive PPA. And this would be a long-term asset that I think would fit nicely in our portfolio.
Shahriar Pourreza : And then, John, just on the NEP side, I mean, obviously, there's been a subtle change in language around timing, obviously, concluding the financial review by the year-end call. I guess, what's given the confidence this quarter to put that time line out there? Is there kind of a range of preferred outcomes that you can at least highlight to investors, especially as you've kind of removed the language around the distribution growth targets? I guess what should we read into that? I mean, obviously, the market is a little bit jittery around that language change. And can you at least confirm if you see yourself as remaining the owner of this entity into the future?
John Ketchum : So as we have said to investors over the last several months, we're completing our review regarding how to address [SEPFs] and NEPs cost of capital. We've been exploring a number of options as part of that. And as we said today, we're also really reflecting on the YieldCo model itself and contemplating the strategic shift in how we allocate capital. One of the things that we are evaluating is should we put -- deploying more of our capital towards really growing the underlying cash flow of the business and maybe less towards distributions. And so that's one of the things that we're thinking about. Obviously, we have to also address the back-end convertible equity portfolio financings. But what we wanted to do is just be upfront with investors that this review is coming to a conclusion, and we'll be prepared to provide updated feedback on our distribution policy going forward on the fourth quarter call.
Shahriar Pourreza : So just reflecting on sort of the YieldCo model, it sounds like even NextEra remaining the ultimate owner of NEP is something that's a question mark as well too, right?
John Ketchum : Yes. Look, I think going forward our preference would be to remain the owner of NextEra Energy Partners. We've looked at -- we consider all available options and alternatives. They don't discount any potential options going forward, but our base case would be to remain the owner of NEP going forward. And Shar, the thing I want to add is we talked a lot about on this call about the underlying dynamics in the industry. We're in a period of substantial power demand in this industry. And there are many things where NextEra Energy is -- has a superior position in markets and there are going to be a number of potential growth opportunities that could favor not only NextEra Energy, but also potentially NextEra Energy Partners. Going forward, obviously, data centers being a big part of that as well. And so, we have a number of things that we're looking at that could potentially lead to attractive growth opportunities for NEP going forward.
Operator: The next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Jefferies.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith : John -- I know you guys are always a step ahead of everyone else here. So I wanted to get ahead here, how do you frame the discussion on safe harboring assets heading into the election outcome, whatever it may be? How would you assess derisking your plans through '27, as you guys have talked about or even frankly, beyond the '27 point in terms of proactively safe harboring your outlook, whether that's storage, solar or wind?
John Ketchum : Yes. We have fully derisked our safe harbor program. I mean, we're bought through '29. So those that are familiar with the safe harbor program that would -- the moves that we have made and the investments that we have made have protected our development program through the 4 year safe harbor through 2029. First -- so that's the first thing that I would say. The second piece is, don't forget, we're always very forward-looking from a supply chain perspective. And we've also -- we're very long transformers, we're very long switchgears, other electrical equipment that have caused problems for others in the industry. So we have planned ahead. We've taken all the necessary steps on safe harboring and we've also taken all the necessary steps in terms of locking up critical electric infrastructure that is leading to delays of projects by small developers, which, again, the small developers have fallen down. I think the tolerance level of our utility customer base and our C&I customer base is weathered thin and so they're now looking to -- they have too much to lose too much on the line and they want to do business with established developers like NextEra that they know are going to get their projects built on time and that plan ahead. And don't get caught off guard by some of these issues that have chronically impacted the small developer in the renewable space.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith : You guys are always a step ahead as you say. Quick nuance here at Seabrook. I'm just curious, we talk about Duane here, but what's the situation there with the thoughts about New England on any further, should we say colocation or long-term off-take arrangements there with potential counterparties?
John Ketchum: Yes. So for us, I mean, we look at our entire nuclear fleet as part of our data center strategy. So we're sort of technology agnostic as we approach it. Most of the conversations that we have with data center customers are around renewables. But obviously, we have a comprehensive expertise across the energy value chain, whether it's wind, whether it's solar, whether it's battery storage, whether it's transmission, whether it's gas, coupled with the renewable solution and whether it's nuclear. And I think we're uniquely positioned in that regard because we do it all. We know what it all costs. We have the data to support it all. And what we try to do is have educated discussions with our customer base to provide them with the low-cost, most comprehensive clean energy solution that addresses the demands that they see going forward to satisfy their business needs.
Operator: And the next question comes from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley.
David Arcaro : Wondering if you could expand a little bit on your thoughts on SMRs as an asset. And in particular, if you might consider that at FPL over time within your resource mix?
John Ketchum : Yes. On SMR, so let me start with -- we have a small SMR team inside the company, right? So we have been following SMRs for a very long time. We actually advised a couple of Fortune 100 companies on SMRs today. But here's what we see. We're very close to the SMR market. There's really 9, 11, it depends on your count of how many OEMs there are in the SMR area. We look at them all. We know we do technology reviews around them. We do financial reviews around them. A lot of them are very strained financially. They are only a handful that really have capitalization that could actually carry them through the next several years. And so that's one piece. The second piece is, look, you're looking at a first-of-a-kind technology that are unproven, that comes with a ton of risk associated with that. They're still very expensive. I don't see that changing. Really as things move forward. There -- particularly as you see renewables getting cheaper, and I think renewables used for energy and storage and gas use for capacity I think, on an economic basis, tougher SMRs to compete. The other thing that doesn't get a lot of attention is nuclear fuel. The nuclear fuel supply chain has a lot of repair and work that has to occur. I think most of you know, we passed sanctions against Russia on enrichment and conversion. We basically have to start enrichment and conversion industry here in the U.S. It's going to take a lot of time to get that up and running. Some SMRs, they don't run off of low-enriched uranium, they run off of HALEU, HALEU remains a bit unproven as well. And so when we stack all that together, David, that's why we're just not bullish SMRs. We think it's kind of next -- end of the next decade alternative. But it is also something that we stay close to. And we have capacity at our existing generation facilities to be able to add SMRs. And it's something that FPL will continue to keep a close eye on also as we move forward. But again, it's so far out in the future from a viability standpoint at scale. It's -- we're prioritizing other generation resources at this time and I think renewables are, as I said in my prepared remarks are here for the long haul.
David Arcaro : And then you had mentioned renewables returns earlier, just given the strong demand backdrop. Wondering if you could just give a little bit more color on what you're seeing in terms of the trend of renewable returns for incremental projects right now?
John Ketchum : Sure. I'm going to turn that over to Rebecca.
Rebecca Kujawa : As you might expect from our comments on not only the second quarter in a row of 3 gigawatt signings and the real excitement for us on these framework agreements, not just the ones we announced, but also ones that we haven't gotten to the point of announcing. It is clearly a change dynamic in terms of need for what we have to offer. And it's safe to say that there are opportunities for us to improve margin and where that makes sense, we certainly are taking advantage of that. So I would say it's much more of an upward trajectory than staying the same and certainly not going down. And you should also expect that we will continue to be very disciplined in both the capital allocation as well as being aware of where cost of capital are. So as we've seen changes in rates, you should also expect us to respond appropriately to that. But the market dynamic for us and our unique position in this industry is a very positive tailwind for us.
Operator: The next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.
Jeremy Tonet : Just want to turn to the near backlog additions. It looks like 3 gigs has been added the past few quarters here, and it looks like about 11 over the past year. Just wondering, I guess, your expectation for run rate backlog additions over an extended period of time. Should we be thinking kind of like 12 a year roughly? Or do you see that increasing over time? And then on Slide 5, you lay out significant demand growth there for renewables. And just wondering how you think about NextEra market share going forward there?
Rebecca Kujawa : I'll take the first stab at both of those. In terms of the run rate, just in lower gigawatt signings, I'll say the similar comments in higher quarterly signings which is we shouldn't expect these to be perfectly linear. And there will be changes quarter-to-quarter. So I'd be hesitant to say that 3 gigawatts is the new normal for now and forever more. But it is very clear and we made the comments for a reason that we have seen the change in demand that we've been talking about, and we've been expecting given both the color commentary in the marketplace as well as what's actually happening in the ground for real demand of new electrons, both in the form of energy and capacity. And I'm really proud of our team. We've invested a lot in our greenfield development program over years and developed a lot of technology and capability to ensure that we can scale that effectively and that is proving out to bring high-quality projects to market with teams that are working closely with our customers to ensure that we're getting those right projects to them at the right time, the right place and in the right price for us mutually. So clearly, a positive tailwind. And at this point, I would say we continue to feel comfortable with the expectations that we laid out in greater detail at the investor conference in June, where we think our overall 4 year development expectations are in aggregate through 2027. So I think this is a great quarter on route to being in those ranges. In terms of I forgot the second part of your question, actually, Jeremy, did that cover the checking part too?
Jeremy Tonet : Just market share going forward.
Rebecca Kujawa : Listen, we've over a long period of time, had ranges in the market share, I would say, across the technologies, roughly a 20% market share has been a rough consistent performance over time. I think that is certainly achievable and potentially higher. And as you know, we'll continue to balance both higher market share and higher margin, and they are interrelated to an extent. And we're going to make sure that we continue to optimize that. I don't want to build every single project that we could possibly sell to somebody. I want to build the projects that have great returns that create value for our shareholders and build incremental value for our platform over time. And that's what we are going to continue staying focused on.
Jeremy Tonet : And just quickly, I guess, on origination opportunity set, how do you see solar versus wind stacking up at this point and also big addition in batteries there. So just wondering what you're seeing currently on that front?
Rebecca Kujawa : I would say the trends are consistent with what we've talked about for the last couple of quarters and specifically in more detail at the investor conference. There's clearly a tailwind for solar and even more so for storage, relatively speaking, over the last couple of years. For solar, I think it's a couple of things. It's relatively attractive to the other generation technologies and specifically attractive with the addition of the PTC relative to what it had before, which is ITC and therefore, made it more economic and more regions in the last five to seven years. On storage, it's really about capacity value, as John outlined in our prepared remarks. It is clear that we need both energy and capacity to meet the incremental demand that utilities are seeing for the first time in decades. And storage is ready to deploy and in the places where it is needed most. So our customers are really interested in seeing those storage projects come to market. Wind has continued to be a little bit weaker relatively speaking to how strong it was for the first couple of decades of our renewables development program. There's still quite a number of customers that are interested in it. We have a good pipeline of projects in discussions with a variety of customers across the United States. And we see a mix of those resources being a good complement to one another to meet these 7/24 solutions. So having a pipeline of all three technologies has served us well, and we'll continue to pursue that path.
Operator: The next question comes from Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank.
Andrew Weisel : Just a quick couple of follow-ups actually. So first on Duane Arnold, I don't want to get too bogged down on the details, but one question I had is about transmission constraints. I know when the nuclear unit shut down, you agreed with Alliant to build a lot of solar and best storage -- battery storage. Given that the new capacity addition will take up some of the preexisting transmission capacity, will you need to expand transmission opportunity there if you were to restart the [Nuke]? And if so, would that add a lot of time in addition to the cost?
John Ketchum : Yes. Andrew, this is one of the benefits of having a very large pipeline. So because we have a very large pipeline, we have the ability to convert queue positions over to different types of technologies. So not concerned about the transmission.
Andrew Weisel : Second, on the framework agreement between Entergy and the two new ones, it's about 15 gigawatts. I understand it's kind of the outer years. My question is, would any of that come to the roughly 40 gigawatts you're planning to add between now and 2027? Or should we think of this as all being helping to sustain growth beyond that -- the planning period?
John Ketchum : Yes. I think for now, look, we look at these opportunities as contributing to the midpoint of our expectations. Obviously, we always hope to do better and these framework agreements put us in a position to do better.
Andrew Weisel : You don't use the word midpoint very often. Okay. Fair enough. One -- sorry, go ahead.
John Ketchum : I was just going to say, midpoint is just a reference to our current development expectations. Obviously, we're pushing the team to do far better than the midpoint. And again, the framework agreement, I think gives us opportunities that we otherwise would not have had.
Andrew Weisel : Then one subtle question about the quarterly results. Customer supply was a negative $0.10 year-over-year drag. And I know last quarter, it was minus $0.03 as well, although it was positive in the first quarter. I know it's a bit of a more volatile business, but can you just talk a little bit about the dynamics for customer supply at near and maybe some thoughts on the outlook?
John Ketchum : Yes. I think what you're seeing at our customer supply business. Number one is you got to remember, coming off of 2022, we had very high gas prices, which created a lot of volatility and high margins in that business, not only for us, but for others that participate in that business. Obviously, as gas prices have subsided, we've seen less volatility in that market. Some of the margins have come in a bit and more normalized. And I think we've seen that carry over to the origination activity as well. So look, that business has done great, and we expect it continue to be a solid contributor going forward, but some of what we saw coming off of '22 has subsided and that's really the commentary that we were trying to get across in our prepared remarks today.
Andrew Weisel : And congratulations on swift storm restoration efforts.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-07-24 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners LP Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mark Edelman, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Mark Edelman: Thank you, Danielle. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our second quarter 2024 combined financial results conference call for NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. With me this morning are John Ketchum, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; Brian Bolster, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; Rebecca Kujawa, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources; and Mark Hickson, Executive Vice President of NextEra Energy, all of whom are also officers of NextEra Energy Partners as well as Armando Pimentel, President and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light Company. John will start with opening remarks and then Brian will provide a review of our results. Our executive team will then be available to answer your questions. We will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call in the Risk Factors section of the company presentation or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found on our website, www.nexteraenergy.com and www.nexteraenergypartners.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. Today's presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of historical non-GAAP measures to the closest GAAP financial measure. With that, I'll turn the call over to John.
John Ketchum: Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy delivered strong increasing more than 9% year-over-year. In addition, through the first six months of the year, our adjusted earnings per share has increased 9.4% year-over-year. The continued strong financial and operational performance at both FPL and Energy Resources position our company well to meet its overall objectives for the year. At FPL, we have continued to deliver for our customers on multiple fronts since the start of our most recent rate settlement in 2022. We are making smart capital investments in low cost solar generation and battery storage. We’re continuing to reduce our overall fuel cost and combined with generation modernizations have saved customers nearly $16 billion since 2001. We are delivering best in class non-fuel O&M where we're 70% better than the national average, saving our customers $3 billion every year compared to the average utility. A big driver of our outperformance has been our team and culture of continuous improvement and productivity. Nowhere is this better demonstrated than through our annual companywide initiative to reimagine everything that we do, which we call Project Velocity. This year, we identified record $460 million of run rate cost savings opportunities through 2027, part of which benefit FPL and its customers. By finding opportunities to take cost out of the business and making smart capital investments to reduce its fuel costs, FPL has kept residential bills nearly 40% below the national average and by far the lowest among all the Florida investor owned utilities. FPL’s reliability also ranks among the best in the industry, where we are 66% better than the national average in the number of minutes a customer's power is interrupted per year. I'm most proud of the fact we continue to deliver on our customer value proposition during a period of unprecedented growth in Florida. Florida continues to be one of the fastest growing states in the U. S. with roughly 1,000 people moving to Florida every day. And it's not just the residential sector. We're seeing the commercial and industrial sector growing too. As a result of this accelerated growth, FPL's regulatory capital employed has grown at a 12% compound annual growth rate since the beginning of 2022 compared against an estimated 9% comp in annual growth rate that was originally anticipated for the four year settlement period. We have shouldered this additional growth through our reserve amortization mechanism, which enables FPL to absorb the cost for these capital investments without increasing customer bills in the interim. While these efforts have helped us to meet customer growth and deliver for our Florida customers, our reserve amortization mechanism has been utilized faster than expected. FPL fully expects to seek recovery of these increased expenditures in its rate case filing next year. FPL ended the second quarter with a remaining reserve amortization balance of $586 million which is expected to be sufficient to support FPL's capital investment plan and its ability to earn an 11.4% regulatory ROE this year and next. An 11.4% percent regulatory ROE is expected to have a $0.06 EPS impact in each of 2024 and 2025, which has already been taken into account in our financial expectations, and we will be disappointed if we are unable to deliver financial results at or near the top of our adjusted earnings per share expectation ranges each year through 2027 at NextEra Energy. We expect to continue to demonstrate the benefits and protections that the reserve amortization mechanism provides customers when we file our rate case next year. Our vision is for FPL to be the best utility franchise in the country by doubling down on what we do best, delivering low bills and high reliability for our customers by making smart capital investments and being an industry leader on costs. These attributes are important to our customers and regulators, and they are important to us. We look forward to continuing to deliver on what we believe is an outstanding customer value proposition at FPL. Growth is not only occurring inside Florida, but outside Florida as well. At Energy Resources, we are benefiting from two types of demand, replacement cycle and gross cycle demand. With regard to the former, we have long been a beneficiary of a replacement cycle where higher cost, less efficient generation has been retired in favor of low cost renewables and battery storage. We expect this to continue and while replacement cycle demand has been around for a long time, growth cycle demand is new. With the exception of a few states such as Florida, power demand from new growth has been static in our industry for decades. That's changing as power demand is projected to grow 4x faster over the next 2 decades compared to the prior two. That growth is being driven by demand across multiple sectors, which is expected to create a long term opportunity for faster deploy low cost generation. As highlighted at our investor conference, we expect the demand for new renewables to triple over the next seven years versus the prior seven to help meet this increased power demand. Energy Resources couldn't be better positioned as it has a 300 gigawatt pipeline, half of which is in the interconnection queue process or is already interconnection ready. Our scaled experience and technology coupled with our ability to build new transmission where required enable us to meet the growing demands of our power and commercial and industrial customer base. Underpinning these competitive advantages are our decades of data, analytical capabilities and experience with system operators and relationships with utilities that position us well to get the power to where it needs to go. Our continued ability to drive origination results speaks for itself. Energy Resources added over 3,000 megawatts of new renewables and storage projects for the backlog this quarter, 860 megawatts of which come from agreements with Google to meet their data center power demand. This marks our second best origination quarter ever. These results support our belief that the bulk of the growth demand will be met by a combination of new renewables and battery storage. The importance of renewable and storage to help meet our economies growing demand for power has never been more evident. As data center growth accelerates to facilitate our economy shift to artificial intelligence, and as we continue to re-domesticate and electrify across multiple sectors, our nation must embrace an all of the above strategy to meet increasing electric demand. Renewables and storage are energy independent as they rely on American wind and sunshine. They also are extremely fast to deploy compared to alternative forms of generation making them vital to our country's success going forward. And importantly, the country has stood up a significant domestic industry to support their growth, which is driving investment in factories and is creating good paying jobs and a tax base that is revitalizing rural communities across America. As customers increasingly demand smart clean energy solutions, we are the company with experience in every part of the energy value chain and are uniquely positioned to help them make the right decisions for their business. As the owner and operator of a large natural gas-fired fleet in Florida, we are also conscious of the importance of natural gas-fired generation as a bridge fuel. Yet, we also are well aware of the realities of new build gas-fired generation. It's more expensive in most states, is subject to fuel price volatility and takes considerable time given the need to get gas delivered generating unit and the three to four year waiting period for gas turbines. Low cost, fast to deploy renewables help keep power prices down, making our economy more competitive globally. Ultimately, our country needs all forms of energy as we move forward and the future has never been brighter for the power generation sector as a whole and renewables in particular. As I've been saying, NextEra Energy was built for this moment and our future outlook has never been stronger. Our strategic focus is to deliver low cost clean energy and storage for customers both inside and outside Florida, while building new transmission where required to support new generation. We have the playbook and the platform to win in any environment and most importantly, we have the team. Our competitive advantages continue to grow every day, providing industry differentiation that is over two decades in the making and difficult to replicate. And I firmly believe, we will continue to expand that strategic distance, creating value for customers and shareholders. Nobody is better positioned to meet the demands of the energy customer of tomorrow than NextEra Energy. And I wouldn't trade our opportunity set with anyone. With that, I will turn the call over to Brian to cover the detailed results beginning with FPL.
Brian Bolster: Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. For the second quarter of 2024, FPL increased earnings per share by $0.03 year-over-year. The principal driver of this performance was FPL's regulatory capital employed growth of approximately 10.7% year-over-year. We continue to expect FPL to realize roughly 10% average annual growth in regulatory capital employed over our current rate agreements four year term, which runs through 2025. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $2.1 billion for the quarter, and we expect FPL's full year 2024 capital investments to be between $8 billion $8.8 billion. Over the current four year settlement agreement, we expect FPL's capital investments to exceed $3 billion, $4 billion. FPL's second quarter retail sales increased 3.7% from the prior year comparable period due to warmer weather, which had a positive year-over-year impact on usage for costumer of approximately 2.6%. As a result FPL grew retail sales in second quarter by roughly 1.1% on a weather normalized basis. For the 12 months ending June 2024, FPL's reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.8% and the 11.4% regulatory ROE mentioned previously is expected to be realized in the fourth quarter for the 12-months ending December 2024. Now let's turn to Energy Resources, which reported adjusted earnings growth of approximately 10.8% per year -- at 10.8% year-over-year and Energy Resources adjusted earnings per share increased by $0.03 year-over-year. Contributions from new investments increased $0.12 per share year-over-year, primarily driven by continued growth in our renewables portfolio. Our existing clean energy portfolio increased $0.06 per share, primarily reflecting an increase in wind resources during the quarter. Wind resource for the Q2 of 2024 was approximately 104% of the long term average versus 88% in the second quarter of 2023. The comparative contribution from our customer supply business, which you'll recall had strong earnings last year, decreased by $0.03 per share. Contributions from our gas infrastructure business decreased by $0.07 per share, due to a combination of higher depletion expense related to lower production estimates, certain non-recurring items and the sale of the Texas pipelines by NextEra Energy Partners. While we may see a few pennies impact again next quarter, we expect gas infrastructure's earnings growth to be effectively flat going forward as we continue to allocate more capital on a relative basis to renewables, storage and transmission. Similar to what we saw this quarter, the increased contributions from new investment driven by the strength of our renewable development program are expected to more than offset any slowing in gas infrastructure growth going forward. All other impacts reduced earnings by $0.05 per share. Energy resources had a strong quarter of new renewables and storage origination, adding 3,000 megawatts to the backlog. With these additions, our backlog now totals roughly 22.6 gigawatts after taking into account more than 1,600 megawatts of new projects placed in the service since our last earnings call, providing great visibility into energy resources ability to deliver on our development program expectations which we recently extended at our Investor Conference. We expect the backlog additions will go into service over the next few years and into 2028. Energy resources 300 gigawatt pipeline is years in the making and ready to respond to customer demand. We have competitive advantages understanding transmission and grid constraints. We have strong relationships with utilities serving the growing power grid. We can build system solutions across stakeholders and customer needs, and we can leverage our proprietary technology to site and deploy the best projects for our customers. A great example is our collaboration with Entergy, where we are targeting to build 4.5 gigawatts of renewable storage solutions to help them meet both their new increased load demand and energy transition goals. And we couldn't be more excited to work with a long-term established customer in order to help them execute on these goals. Another example is our collaboration with Google. As John said earlier, this quarter's backlog addition include 860 megawatts signed with Google to support their data center needs. That brings our total renewables portfolio with technology and data center customers, including assets in operation and in backlog to 7 gigawatts. Our competitive position is even further advantaged by our existing portfolio, with interconnection timelines for new sites stretching for three to seven years or beyond. We can dramatically improve our speed to market by utilizing the existing interconnection from our operating footprint to deploy co-located solar and storage, as well as execute on wind and potentially solar repowers. This optionality provides a unique resource to meet our customer needs, while also capitalizing on the embedded option value from the existing portfolio. Beyond renewables and storage, we're excited to say that Mountain Valley Pipeline is now in service. Turning now to Q2 2024 consolidated results. Adjusted earnings from corporate and other increased by $0.02 per share year-over-year. During the quarter, NextEra issued $2 billion of equity units and recently Energy Resources entered into an agreement with Blackstone to sell a partial interest in a portfolio of wind and solar projects for approximately $900 million. Our long-term financial expectations, which we stated last month at our Investor Conference, remain unchanged. We will be disappointed if we're not able to deliver financial results at or near the top-end of our adjusted EPS expectations range in 2024, 2025, 2026 and 2027. From 2023 to 2027, we continue to expect that our average annual growth and operating cash flow will be at or above our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. And we also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at roughly 10% per year through at least ‘26 off of 2024 base. As always, our expectations assume our caveats. Turning next to NextEra Energy Partners. Yesterday, NextEra Energy Partners' board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.95 per common unit or $3.62 per common unit on an annualized basis, up approximately 6% from a year earlier. Turning to the balance sheet, since our last earnings call, the partnership completed the next net renewables to equity buyout of roughly $190 million in June 2024 and paid down our 2024 convertible maturity with cash on hand. After repayment of a $700 million HoldCo debt maturity earlier this month, the partnership now has approximately $2.7 billion of liquidity. Let me now turn to the detailed results. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $560 million and cash available for distribution was $220 million. New projects, which primarily reflect contributions from approximately 780 net megawatts of new assets that either closed in the Q2 of 2023 or achieved commercial operations in 2023 contributed approximately $39 million of adjusted EBITDA and $9 million of cash available for distribution. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA contribution from existing projects grew by approximately $62 million year-over-year, driven primarily by favorable wind resource during the quarter and partially offset by lower solar generation. Wind resources approximately 103% of the long term average versus 88% in the second of 2023. Finally, adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution declined by approximately $46 million and $43 million respectively, from the divestiture of the Texas pipeline portfolio, which is partially offset by the interest benefit of the remaining cash proceeds received from the sale of these assets. From a base of our fourth quarter 2023 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $3.52. The partnership continue to see 5% to 8% growth per year in LP distributions per unit with the current target of 6% growth per year as being a reasonable product range of expectations through at least 2026. NextEra Energy Partners expects the partner's payout ratio to be in the mid to high 90s through 2026. We expect the annualized rate of the fourth 2024 distribution that is payable in February 2025 to be $3.73 per common unit. In terms of next steps for NextEra Energy Partners, as we have discussed with you previously, the partnership is continuing to look at all options to secure a competitive cost of capital and to address the remaining convertible equity portfolio financing buyouts. At the same time, the partnership's 6% distribution growth target remains for now. NextEra Energy Partners does not need an acquisition related financing in 2024 to meet its 6% target and does not need gross equity until 2027. NextEra Energy Partners owns a large portfolio of high quality long term contracted clean energy assets and the partnership has attractive organic growth from the repowering of its existing portfolio. We expect to share more in the coming quarters as we address these objectives. NextEra Energy Partners expects run rate contributions for adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution from its forecasted portfolio at December 31, 2024 to be in the ranges of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion and $730 million to $820 million respectively. As a reminder, year-end 2024 run rate projections reflect calendar year 2025 contributions from the forecasted portfolio at year-end 2024. As a further reminder, our expectations are subject to our caveats. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we'll open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research.
Steve Fleishman: Just first on the comments on the kind of update on the reserve amortization and earned ROE. Could you just go back through that again, John, in terms of just the -- what's driven the increased usage? Is it just that you've ramped up capital a lot quicker than initially planned? Or just maybe give a little bit of color on -- a little more color on that comment?
John Ketchum: Yeah. No, absolutely, Steve. So we've had a lot of population growth in Florida, a lot of that has impacted our service territory. When we first entered in the settlement agreement, back in ’21, we’ve got our regulatory capital employed to be around 9%. It's actually been around 12% as we have accommodated that growth. And so we've got surplus that's right around $586 million today as we look forward for this year and next based on where we are, the capital plans that we have for the FPL business, which are still very strong to take into account the further growth that we see. We believe that with that amortization balance and those CapEx plans will probably be right around an 11.4% ROE for the full year '24 and for the full year ‘25. And that has about a $0.06 impact here this year and a $0.06 impact next year. It's already folded into our financial expectations and not a concern in terms of our ability to cover it. And a big plus from the Steve is, it really I think is a good fact heading into a refiling in 2025 because it demonstrates how the surplus mechanism can really help customers. And the last point that I'll make is don't forget these additional capital investments that we've made, we would expect to see full recovery of in our next filing. So this remember that the surplus mechanism is intended really just to deal with the regulatory lag as we make new investments at FPL to accommodate the additional growth. So we're not worried about this. This is something that is something that we feel very comfortable about addressing in our financial expectations and doesn't impact where we feel like we will end up this year and next.
Steve Fleishman: Okay, thanks. And then on the Blackstone financing that you mentioned, the $900 million any information on just the size of the portfolio that was sold and or the stake in that portfolio?
John Ketchum: Yeah, it was 1.6 gigawatt portfolio just a mix of renewable assets. And I think the real positive takeaway here for investors is there's a real demand for NextEra assets. I mean, we are recognized in the private equity market as being really the top developer. And given all the growth and this quarter is a great example of the 3 gigawatts that we were able to do. We have a strong trajectory going forward. And as private equity has opportunities to work with us and we have a long history of working with private equity going back the last five or six years. It really is a good potential win-win for us and for them. With the Blackstone organization, we really like the capability that they bring to the table and there's a lot of crossover between our two organizations in terms of what we do. And so this was a good fit for us.
Steve Fleishman: And just is what's the percent stake a piece of the 1.6% or their stake is 1.6%?
John Ketchum: They invested capital alongside us. And so they have a partial interest in that portfolio of 1.6 gigawatts.
Steve Fleishman: Got it. And then last question, just on the recent issue. I know you're not doing offshore wind, but just this recent issue with the GE turbines -- turbine at Vineyard Wind, and I know there was a lawsuit filed by AEP. Can you just maybe talk to your turbine performance with them and just are you seeing any issues and how you're feeling about that?
John Ketchum: Yes, for us, I mean, look, first I'll start with the fact that we are a top tensile operator of wind. I think really recognized as the best operator of wind in the business. And we have a real partnership with GE, and so, look, wind turbines have moving parts, they'll have issues from time to time. But our partnership with GE runs 20 years and so we've really never had issues in getting things and we're always able to structure win-win arrangements with them. So as any problems arise to the portfolio they've always been well managed and addressed in a conciliatory way with GE and future.
Operator: The next question comes from Shahriar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners.
Shahriar Pourreza: So just real quick, I want to start on NEP. I mean, obviously, you guys have the standard language around continuing to evaluate all options. I mean, Brian obviously reiterated the current CAGR, but also used the word for now core-on-core which is somewhat new language, believe it or not. Could we get a sense on timing, what range of options you're thinking about? And I guess how confident are you we can get something done at favorable pricing before the dividend goes under some level of pressure in '27?
Brian Bolster: Hey, thanks, Shah. Obviously, NEP is getting a lot of our attention in terms of looking at what the alternatives are to both improve the cost of capital, which really requires us to be able to successfully address the back end [SEPFs]. And as we said in the prepared remarks, all options are on the table. And what we really are spending time on and we are looking at various solutions around this is how do you tackle those back end setups in a constructive way that makes sense in terms of the cost of capital that would be required to do that and then how do we put NEP in a better position for success going forward. So as part of that, we are obviously exploring all alternatives. We've mentioned private capital as one potential avenue there as well. The good thing is that we have time. We have time in 2024. We've said in the market, we don't have to do anything, we don't have a drops plan for '24, don't have growth equity needs until '27. And so we are being thoughtful about our approach around NEP.
Shahriar Pourreza: And I think Brian just to not to take words out of [indiscernible] mentioned in the next couple of quarters is that -- is this something maybe we'll get to some sort of a definitive direction this year?
Brian Bolster: Yes. Sure. I don't want to put a firm deadline on it. But I think the language we use is over the next few quarters and once we have identified a solution that we think makes sense then obviously we will share that but not until then.
Shahriar Pourreza: And then just on NEE obviously just congrats on a very strong origination quarter, it was definitely on the higher end, Google was a key contributor. I guess do your sort of existing contract protections and supply chain maybe strategy like to kind of navigate some of the challenges in this space as you're continuing to expand development to maybe much higher levels, right? So can supply chain kind of these bottlenecks that we've seen become a governor around backlog additions as we look through '25 and beyond, especially as you're trying to meet the needs of these large energy intensive customers like the hyperscalers?
Brian Bolster: So here's how I think about supply chain. These are number one, there is been some attention around AD/CVD filing and tariffs and those things. We're not impacted. And I made the comment and we spent a lot of time with this both in March and then at our Investor Conference in June still matters more than ever in this business. So the way I would think about it from an investor perspective is the bigger our program, the more leverage we have over our supplier. And in the last couple of years, we have really spent a lot of time and made investment around the data and analytical capability that we have around our supply chain. And we have also made a very conscientious effort around risk transfer and making sure that we have adequate securities to provide incentive to perform. So we are in a position where we have really been able to transfer any tariff for AD/CVD or related risks over to our suppliers. Why is that? The reason for that is when putting numbers up like 3 gigawatts a quarter and have the type of build that we have and expect to have going forward. The contractors and vendors want to work with us. And they've also seen a lot of small developers that ultimately haven't been able to arrange financing or for whatever reason haven't had terrific follow through on their projects. That's not the case with our company. And so there's been even a greater emphasis I would say by our suppliers who want to work with us more than ever. But what that means is making sure that we are always left in a position where we are not taking risks around the obvious things that you might put on your list. And so I really feel better than ever about where we stand from a supply chain perspective and I am very happy with the job that our team has done and the lessons that we've learned over the last couple of years have all been folded into how we contractually approach risk in our agreements going forward.
Operator: The next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Jefferies.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yeah, a pleasure. Yes, likewise. Can you speak to how you're thinking about asset recycling here? I mean, I'm curious specifically on the latest portfolio sell down right with Blackstone as mentioned earlier. But how do you think about other assets here? As you think about like for instance some of these headlines on transmission or gas infra is being in focus. It's notable after the FCG sale last year. How do you think about continued monetization of renewable assets or portfolios relative to sort of the ongoing streamlining and focusing back to the core renewables business, if you will? And then related, how do you think about that 70-30 mix, as you pair back, as you pair these different asset sales through the forecast period?
John Ketchum: Yes. No, good question, Julien. So from a recycling standpoint, feel better than I ever have in terms of the options that we have going forward for the portfolio. In terms of asset mix and how we think about that, obviously, we've always had a history of being able to recycle capital around renewables, which are terrific assets which I think we have a great reputation in the market around and our ability to attract capital on the renewable portfolio. But look, we are also making a conscientious effort and I think I made these comments at the Investor Conference that we're looking at our core business, right. Our core business is wind, it's solar, it's battery storage, it's transmission both inside Florida, outside of Florida. And so to the extent we can do some targeted capital recycling around our gas infrastructure business that will continue to be top of mind. Transmission, you raised as well. We are having a lot of success in transmission and the team has done a terrific job I think on the competitive transmission side of identifying new opportunities, and just based on the return structure that we could target, there's good sense to bring in a partner on some of those deals. And so those have been opportunities that we have been targeting as well as we think about the future. But obviously it puts us in a position where we continue to manage those assets and those opportunities as we think about how they contribute to the future. But those certainly are 2 things that we look at in addition to the renewable portfolio. And the numbers that we gave at the Investor Conference, I certainly don't lose any sleepover in terms of the ability to meet those capital recycling targets. From a business mix perspective, I think which is your last question, you know and I think most folks on the phone know that we are very rigorous about looking at our five year forecast and even go beyond that. And so we're constantly looking at our mix and what our obligations are and undertakings are with the agencies and we have a lot of headroom, a lot of headroom on our business mix. So that is not an issue, that is not a concern and the capital recycling plan I think fits well with what our undertakings are there, but plenty ahead of room on business mix.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: And just clarification on the last question. Just with respect to getting that 3 gigawatt milestone for the quarter here in terms of bookings, is that kind of a good new run rate here or again given the size of these new counterparties is it going to be fairly lumpy moving up and down quarter to quarter here. Just trying to set, a little bit of an expectation there.
John Ketchum: Absolutely. I'm going to turn that one over to Rebecca.
Rebecca Kujawa: Good morning, Julian. We couldn't be more excited about the origination, not only that we've been able to produce over the last couple of years, each of them being a record in their own right and then the first two quarters being each of them, ironically, the second best quarter, obviously, this quarter topping last quarter that we've ever had. I'll caveat it that origination can be a little bit lumpy. I've consistently said that in quarters where it's a little bit lower than where we are today. And I think I even said it the day that we set the top quarterly additions a couple of quarters ago. So there's always a little bit of bumpiness in there, but what we continue to see is consistent with the comments that we all made at the Investor Conference just last month, that and John talked about in his opening remarks today that the combination of the replacement cycle and the growth cycle is a tremendously positive outlook for us over the very long-term. Some of this is going to take a little bit longer to materialize on the growth side, as we also highlighted last month. As you'll see some of those stronger additions of the 3 gigawatts that we added to our backlog, particularly notably strong in years '26 and '27, and even some megawatts added to '28 and beyond. But overall, what we see today and the execution of our team and the value proposition that we bring to our customers is a very bright outlook. Excellent.
Operator: The next question comes from Nick Campanella from Barclays.
Nick Campanella : Hey, good morning, team. Thanks for all the information today. I just wanted to follow-up on Shah's comments. You talked about being able to kind of pass through some of these higher tariff costs to the extent they kind of materialize. Just there's also a projection for two rate cuts this year and I'm just curious if you can kind of talk about how that changes the returns for near that you kind of communicated at the Analyst Day in previous quarters, if you could just update us on that?
John Ketchum: Sure. First of all, as you know, we are always looking to manage risk around our capital investment decisions. And one of those risks is it's not only locking in equipment cost, it's not only locking in labor, but it's also locking in our cost of capital. So as we approach our renewable portfolio, we've been very mindful of making sure that we are locking in our cost of capital through interest rate hedge products swaps in that regard. As I think about the future and the rate the one, the two rate cuts, who knows where we ultimately end up on those fronts. Obviously given the financing plans that we have moving forward, those would be tailwinds for the business. But at the same time, if those don't materialize, we have already taken those into account in our financial expectations and we're very prudent and on top of managing the risk the interest rate risk exposure that we have across the business.
Nick Campanella: Hey, that's helpful. Thanks a lot. And then, John, I think you've been pretty clear about the ability to supplement this power demand inflection with new renewables. And you also have this nuclear portfolio. I understand a lot of that's kind of contracted, but there were headlines about potential Duane Arnold restart. I guess how realistic is that? Is that something you'd even kind of consider at this juncture? And how do we kind of think about the strategic positioning of your nuclear portfolio?
John Ketchum: Sure. Thanks, Nick, for that question on nuclear. With regard to Duane Arnold, I think there would be opportunities and a lot of demand from the market if we were able to do something with Duane Arnold. Obviously bringing back a nuclear plant is into service is not something that you can do without a lot of thought. And it is something that we are looking at, but there is a lot of thought that has to go into it and obviously a real assessment around risks associated with that as well. And so sure, we're looking at it, but we would only do it if we could do it in a way that is essentially risk free with plenty of mitigants around the approach and there are a few things that we would have to work through. But yes, we are looking at it.
Operator: The next question comes from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan.
Jeremy Tonet: Just want to get a little bit more color on renewables market right now as you've discussed very strong demand in the market. And just wondering going back to some of the comments at the Analyst Day, what trends you see in PPA pricing at this point and how could that potentially benefit NextEra going forward?
Rebecca Kujawa: Thanks, Jeremy. Appreciate the conversation and question. We've continued to see very strong returns with respect to what we think we need in order to be highly confident that we're adding shareholder value, and I would think about the returns that we laid out at the Investor Conferences is almost minimum thresholds that we have at this point. And there are opportunities, where there's significant customer demand. We have unique positioning in the marketplace to make sure that we get even more attractive returns. I'd say it's a very positive dynamic. It was a very difficult market over the last couple of years when we were seeing the supply chain disruption and increasing pricing, both on the capital equipment side and the ROE side and our returns. And fortunately, we've either seen slightly declining or at a minimum stable backdrop, which is certainly helpful for decreasing our risk and also providing an attractive price and attractive product to our customers. So between the attractive price, the speed to market, the clean attribute of renewables and storage as well as the fact as we talked about last month in the queue across the United States today, all of the projects that are looking to be connected, 90% of those megawatts are renewables and storage, and we have a healthy portion of those. And I couldn't be more excited about our position. So I think we're in a great shape to continue to add a lot of shareholder value in the many years ahead.
Operator: The next question comes from David Arcaro from Morgan Stanley.
David Arcaro: We're hearing utilities around the country now with fast growing pipelines, thousands of megawatts of data center requests. It seems to be moving rapidly just month by month they seem to be learning more, getting more demand. I'm wondering just do you think that's already in your numbers, in your renewables targets here or could we potentially see another wave of demand as some of these utilities nail down just how much load is really coming into their service territories?
Rebecca Kujawa: Hi David, it's Rebecca, I'll chime in here. We certainly are hearing from our power sector customers a lot of interest, from various data center customers, whether the data center operators or the hyperscalers. It is a little bit challenging to see how much of that is potentially multiple requests for ultimately the same data center, but there is no escaping the fact that these are very large numbers and things that numbers that I don't think any utility across the industry has seen before. And so it's going to take some time not only to rationalize that and figure out how you address it, but also to procure and bring online the megawatts and the transmission over the long term that is going to be required to serve this demand if it ends up being as strong as we see it and we think it might be. From our perspective, consistent with our comments from last month, we are seeing a lot of interest both from the power sector customers as well as hyperscalers and data center customers. You're clearly seeing some of that show up in our origination, but you're also seeing some of that more of that show up in this '26 and '27 timeframe and now even '28 as we are lining up these projects to support when they will come online for our utility customers. So I think we all are very excited. It is very interesting for our sector to see this growth that we haven't seen in a couple of decades. But I do think from a practical standpoint, it's going to take a couple of years for this really to materialize and utilities to be able to absorb it and serve it. But that's a terrific backdrop for us. Some of these challenges are going to be difficult to solve, and I believe there's no better company to partner with our customers to help solve them.
David Arcaro : Yes, understood. Thanks for that color. And then I was curious on hyperscaler deals. Are there any other details you would be able to provide around the Google relationship here, just maybe the location or timing of when these projects are coming on? Is it a single location or multiple locations? Are you embedding wind, solar storage, multiple technologies in terms of what product maybe makes sense for these hyperscaler deals? And then just along those same lines, would you be interested in some kind of a multi-gigawatt, multi-year framework? Is that an idea that you're pursuing with these bigger hyperscaler customers?
Rebecca Kujawa: Sure. Well, David, I'll answer it more broadly than just specific to one certainly for a variety of reasons, including sensitivities. Some of these comments would otherwise be sent for them for their own competitive positioning. But those specifically were new contracts, and they were to support data center demand wind, solar and battery storage. And then more broadly speaking from a hyperscalars perspective, they are interested in a variety of technologies, wind solar and battery storage. And they I would say probably the biggest change for many of them is a shift or certainly an increasing percentage of these projects that are very specifically associated with the data centers that these hyperscalars are trying to build. So it's less interest in just a pure virtual power purchase agreement where the project could be anywhere in the U. S. to I want to make sure these resources are there to support my datacenters as they are getting connected to the utilities in those local jurisdictions and can come online at the same time. So very much becoming a more physical market, and one in which it's really important that their partners show up and perform and deliver as expected, because they are the load on the other side of that. So that's a very attractive proposition from our perspective. As it relates to the structured agreements, listen, we were most focused on making sure that we add value for these customers. That could come in a variety of different forms and factors, but our primary focus is being there and delivering for them when they need us. And we'll update you as those structures evolve, but it's really focused around creating value with and for them.
Operator: The next question comes from Carly Davenport from Goldman Sachs.
Carly Davenport: Maybe just to start, a lot has obviously changed in the U. S. Election landscape since your last earnings call. So can you just talk us through your latest expectations on potential implications on the IRA and what impact any modification to that legislation might have on your renewable development plans?
John Ketchum: Sure, Carly. I'll go ahead and take that. I start with we've always been able to work with both sides of the aisle in the 22 years that I've been at NextEra. And I don't think this time around is any different and I'm going to go through why. And let's not forget that in that time we've invested hundreds of billions of dollars in American Energy Infrastructure across almost every state in the country who are benefiting from those investments. And we invest in American Energy dominance every single day and are the quintessential all the above energy company. And that doesn't change from one election to the next. And I think really helps when we are working with both sides of the aisle. That said, let's look at where the incentive money is going. The incentives favor republican states, and we've seen an increase in the number of republican lawmakers that are embracing the clean energy credits within the IRA as they see the positive impact to their states and communities, which is hard to turn away from. And the tax laws are very difficult to overturn. And we're very likely to have thin margins in the House and the Senate particularly in light of some of the recent developments. And let's not forget the important role that renewables play and I made some remarks about that in my script today. But renewables create jobs, they create a property tax base that transforms rural communities. Renewables are energy independence, it's electricity generated from the sun and the wind, it's not subject to fuel price volatility. Low cost renewables are also bringing power bills down which attract new investment from data centers, semiconductor chip manufacturers and other sectors that are looking to invest in the U.S., and low power bills can really dictate which states they select to make those investments in. And tariffs are going to further drive investment in the U.S., and with industrial growth across sectors, some of that driven by tariffs, power demand is only going to go up from here. And our country is going to need low cost, fast deploy electricity more than ever. And renewables are the quickest to market and the lowest cost option in almost every state. Otherwise, we're going to slow down and curtail economic growth in our own country and the credits all flow directly to customers in the form of lower power prices. So when you look at all that, why would you cut credits that are creating jobs, create a much needed property tax base in rural America, that flow to customers that result in lower power prices, that attract new investments, and that provide much needed faster deploy resource at a time when demand is accelerated. It just wouldn't make sense. And for all these reasons, we expect the credits to remain in place, the wind, the solar, the battery storage. So all in all, while we would expect the heated rhetoric through the fall campaign, we feel good about where things stand. Again, we have a long history of constructive engagement with both sides of the aisle.
Carly Davenport: Awesome. Appreciate all of that color. It's really helpful. The follow-up was just on the backlog. Wind saw a bit of an acceleration this quarter from being a bit weaker in the last several. Anything in particular you'd point to in sort of driving that? And do you think that's a potential sign of an inflection on the wind demand side?
Rebecca Kujawa: Hi, Carly, it's Rebecca. We were very pleased to add these projects to the backlog and excited about the partnership with the customers with whom we're going to contract them. I wouldn't necessarily draw any additional lines as kind of consistent with the prior comments I made around backlog. Things are going to be lumpy over time. It's terrific that we were able to add some additional wind projects to the backlog. And right now, our expectations remain consistent with what we laid out last month and obviously have again in our presentation materials today in terms of the targets over the next four years. But I did say as part of our comments last month, I am optimistic, hopeful maybe, that as we look back after this four year period, that is potentially the area where we may have been too conservative and maybe on the lower side of it. It is early in the cycle to make that conclusion, but we strongly believe that wind, solar and battery storage as complementary technologies and low cost and fast to deploy, as John just highlighted, are immensely valuable to our customers. And so having the availability of all three, we think will continue to create value for our customer base over a long period of time.
Operator: The next question comes from Andrew Weisel from Deutsche Bank.
Andrew Weisel: Hi, good morning everyone. Just a quick one to clarify please. If I heard you right, I think you said you have 7 gigawatts in total with tech and data center customers. Can you just give us a sense of the pace maybe roughly round numbers how many megawatts per year you've been adding or expect to add? And then if you could also just clarify, is that purely in terms of wind solar storage or does that also include transmission?
Rebecca Kujawa: Hi, Andrew, it's Rebecca. So that is just projects with technology companies, Roughly 3 gigawatts of those are already in service and roughly 4 gigawatts now are the ones that are in the backlog that we plan to build over the coming years. It is a mix of technologies, probably trend wise, fairly consistent with what we have seen for overall trends for renewables development. So projects that are already in service are likely to be more heavily weighted towards wind as we've entered into those relationships over a longer period of time. And then in terms of the backlog, for now, they're more weighted towards solar and storage, but I expect that to even out over time, particularly as these products get more deliberately balanced with new data center demand as these hyperscalers and datacenter operators are starting to put projects in service. So broadly speaking, roughly consistent with overall development trends, And we certainly are seeing a lot of demand, both directly with them as well as in kind of these three way collaborations the utilities that ultimately will need to serve them as they are. And we'll continue to be adding these new data centers and bringing them on themselves.
Andrew Weisel: Do you see much of an opportunity on the transmission side working with data centers or is your focus more on what you were describing?
Rebecca Kujawa: I would say from a transmission perspective, all of this demand, whether it was the historical replacement cycle demand and now further accelerated by the growth demand, particularly as it gets served with renewables and storage, it is incredibly important that new transmission get built in order to be able to get the resources from which they're most optimally generated to where they're most optimally consumed, and that's changing a little bit. But what's not changing is the need to build transmission. We see interest from the hyperscalers and the datacenter operators to understand transmission and be supportive of it getting built. But it is a very technically complex and you need to understand transmission and how to interact with the system operators and the transmission owners and operators themselves. So I don't see them necessarily wanting to build transmission, but they are very interested in having us and others ensure that it gets built to support their own long term objective.
Operator: The next question comes from Durgesh Chopra from Evercore ISI.
Durgesh Chopra: Really, really appreciate you taking the time and answering my questions here. Just all my other questions have been answered. Just one quick follow-up on Carly's questions on election and potential repeal of either risks. How much of that you had a really strong quarter on renewable origination, but how much of that political instability is actually impacting your ability to sign contracts? Is that -- does that come up in your negotiations? Is that keeping your customers away from signing contracts into the future? Any color on that is appreciated.
John Ketchum: Yes, Durgesh, the short answer is absolutely not. If anything and if they really did believe that there were going to be modifications that only accelerate demand which is certainly not something that we believe for the reasons I went through but it's not curtailing demand at all.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session and the conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-04-23 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and welcome to the NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners LP First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to, Kristin Rose, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Kristin Rose: Thank you, Drew. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter 2024 combined financial results conference call for NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. With me this morning are John Ketchum, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; Kirk Crews, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; Rebecca Kujawa, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources; and Mark Hickson, Executive Vice President of NextEra Energy, all of whom are also officers of NextEra Energy Partners, as well as Armando Pimentel, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light Company. John will provide some opening remarks and will then turn the call over to Kirk for a review of our first quarter results. Our executive team will then be available to answer your questions. We will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call in the Risk Factors section of the accompanying presentation or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found on our websites, www.nexteraenergy.com and www.nexteraenergypartners.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. Today's presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of historical non-GAAP measures to the closest GAAP financial measure. With that, I will turn the call over to John.
John Ketchum: Thanks Kristen and good morning. NextEra Energy has strong first quarter results growing adjusted earnings per share by 8.3% year-over-year. Based on FPL and energy resources, financial and operational performance, we are once again off to a solid start for the year. In addition, FPL placed into service 1640 MW of new solar, while Energy Resources added 2765 MW of new renewables and storage projects to its backlog. This quarter marks Energy Resources second best origination quarter ever, as well as its best solar and best storage origination quarter. As we highlighted at our March Renewables Development Day, we believe NextEra Energy is well positioned for the expected strong power demand growth through the end of the decade and beyond. After years of relatively flat U.S. power growth, numerous reports now highlight significant future low growth being driven across industries such as oil and gas, manufacturing and technology. The re-domestication of industry to U.S., supported by public policy, will drive the need for more electricity and the tech industry is going to need data centers to support the expected cloud capacity demands that come with artificial intelligence applications. Of course, increased load demand will not come all at once and will take some time to materialize, but it is clear that many new customers are concerned about power availability to meet their plans and consider power supply as a significant obstacle to business expansion. We believe renewables and storage are a key enabler to help meet this increased demand. In fact, we believe the U.S. renewables and storage market opportunity has the potential to be 3x bigger over the next seven years compared to the last seven, growing from roughly 140 gigawatts of additions to approximately 375 to 450 gigawatts. And we believe no one is better positioned to address these power supply challenges and capitalize on this demand than NextEra Energy. At NextEra Energy, the plan is simple. Our two businesses are deploying capital in renewables, storage and transmission for the benefit of customers, while also providing visible growth opportunities for shareholders. Our enterprise-wide scale decades of experience and technology investments are key competitive advantages that allow us to drive value and meet this expected power demand. Scale is one of our key differentiators, and it matters more than ever. Scale allows us to buy and build with better pricing, better protections, and better positioning to navigate disruption. Scale provides access to capital and cost of capital advantages, allowing us to leverage one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector and worldwide banking relationships to finance projects at beneficial terms. Scale has driven top decile operational performance throughout our generation fleet. Today, NextEra Energy's roughly 74 gigawatt operating fleet, comprised of 35 gigawatts at FPL and 39 gigawatts at Energy Resources, provide significant operational scale. As FPL continues its solar and storage build out and Energy Resources brings new renewables and storage projects online for customers, the operating fleet could grow to over 100 gigawatts by the end of 2026. This would further extend our scale advantages and create value for customers and shareholders. Our scale has enabled greater supply chain diversification and flexibility. And the good news is the solar supply chain has much improved from two years ago. Inflationary pressures are alleviating and manufacturing capacity is significantly expanding. In the U.S. manufacturing incentives are expected to support increases in domestic module manufacturing capacity to over 50 gigawatts by 2026 from just under 8 gigawatts at the end of 2021. We have greater supplier diversity and flexibility than ever before, strengthening our ability to bring low cost solar to American consumers and businesses. Our decades of experience is another key competitive advantage. Our experience allows us to navigate power demand challenges, delivering cost effective, reliable generation for our growing FPL customer base and designing clean energy solutions to help our Energy Resources customers. We understand every part of the energy value chain with deep expertise in all technologies, the power markets and transmission. Our team embraces continuous improvement that drives innovation. We recognized the changing landscape and secured land interconnects and transmission equipment years in advance. Technology is the next frontier for the power industry, and we believe our two-decade head start on the rest of the industry is a significant competitive advantage. Today, NextEra Energy captures 560 billion operational data points each day and has dozens of proprietary artificial intelligence tools to drive analytical, real-time decision making. We use these tools to analyze over 100 attributes of our own data to secure and develop the best sites in Florida and across the country. We use our tools to iterate millions of site layout designs based on proprietary resource data and assessments to maximize value, and we use our tools to operate nearly all our renewable storage and fossil generation fleets around the clock from our headquarters in South Florida. We are leveraging this combination of enterprise-wide scale, decades of experience and investment in technology to better position both businesses to capitalize on what we believe will be years of demand to drive long-term value for customers and shareholders. Today, electricity represents just 20% of overall U.S. energy consumption, and wind and solar generation represents only 16% of the U.S. electricity mix. In short, we believe the U.S. will need a significant and growing amount of electricity over the next decade and beyond, a large part of which will be powered by new renewables and storage. At FPL as more people move into Florida, we are focused on extending the customer value proposition by keeping our bills as low as possible and delivering clean, affordable energy by investing in solar, battery storage and transmission. At Energy Resources, our business is focusing on building low cost wind, solar, battery storage, and transmission. We are using our data and proprietary technology to help power customers balance supply and demand while keeping customer bills affordable. We also use our tools with commercial and industrial customers to identify the best locations based on their physical preferences and most important variables. For both power and commercial and industrial customers we leverage our 300 gigawatt development pipeline and transmission and market expertise to help design the lowest cost clean energy solutions. Both businesses complement each other, deepen our skill sets and advantages, and foster innovation and we leverage our greatest asset, our people, who have decades of experience to drive value for our customers and shareholders. When I consider current energy demands, the long-term electricity needs, and our competitive advantages, I wouldn't trade our opportunity set with anyone. I look forward to telling more of our story and explaining why NextEra Energy is uniquely positioned to lead the electrification of the U.S. economy at our Investor Day on June 11 in New York City. With that, I will turn the call over to Kirk to cover the quarterly results.
Kirk Crews: Thank you, John. For the first quarter of 2024, FPL's earnings per share increased $0.04 year over year. The principal driver of this performance was FPL's regulatory capital employed growth of approximately 11.5% year-over-year. We now expect FPL to realize roughly 10% average annual growth in regulatory capital employed over our current rate agreements four-year term, which runs through 2025. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $2.3 billion for the quarter and we expect FPL's full year 2024 capital investments to be between $7.8 billion and $8.8 billion. For the twelve months ending March 2024 FPL's reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.8%. During the first quarter, we utilized approximately $572 million of reserve amortization, leaving FPL with a balance of roughly $651 million. As we've previously discussed, FPL historically utilizes more reserve amortization in the first half of the year, and we expect this trend to continue this year. Earlier this month, FPL received approval to reduce customer bills due to projected 2024 fuel savings. As a result, FPL's typical 1000 kilowatt hour residential customer bill is expected to be roughly $14 lower in May than the start of the year and approximately 37% lower than the current national average. Over the current four-year settlement agreement we now expect FPL's capital investments to be slightly above our previous range of $32 billion to $34 billion. This quarter FPL placed into service 1640 MW of new cost effective solar, putting FPL's owned and operated solar portfolio at over 6400 MW, which is the largest utility owned solar portfolio in the country. FPL's annual ten-year site plan continues to indicate that solar and storage are the most cost effective answer for customers to add reliable grid capacity over the next decade. The 2024 plan includes similar levels of new solar generation capacity 21 gigawatts across our service territory over the next ten years compared to our 2023 plan. But our 2024 plan doubles the expected deployment of battery storage to over 4 gigawatts, some of which we expect to be needed earlier than forecasted in our 2023 plan. With this plan, we expect to increase FPL solar mix from approximately 6% of our total generation in 2023% to 38% in 2033 while continuing to provide customers with clean, affordable energy. FPL believes battery storage will play an increasingly valuable role for customers, serving as an attractive capacity complement to our growing solar generation. From providing system balancing needs in critical parts of FPL's service territory to supplying energy during any time of day or weather condition, battery storage acts as a key resource to the system that is both valuable and cost effective for customers. Key indicators show that Florida's economy remains healthy. Florida continues to be one of the fastest growing states in the nation and had four of the five fastest growing U.S. metro areas between 2022 and 2023. FPL had its strongest quarter of customer growth in over 15 years, with the average number of customers increasing by more than 100,000 from the comparable prior year period. Although FPL's first quarter retail sales decreased by approximately 1.3% year-over-year, we estimate that weather had a negative impact on usage per customer of approximately 5.4% on a year-over-year basis. After taking weather into account, first quarter retail sales increased roughly 4.1% on a weather normalized basis from the comparable prior year period, driven primarily by continued favorable underlying population growth and usage per customer. Now let's turn to Energy Resources, which reported adjusted earnings growth of approximately 13.1% year-over-year. Contributions from new investments increased $0.15 per share year-over-year, primarily reflecting continued growth in our renewables portfolio. Our existing clean energy portfolio declined $0.02 per share, primarily due to unfavorable wind resource during the quarter. The comparative contribution from our customer supply business increased results by $0.04 per share. All other impacts reduced earnings by $0.12 per share. This decline reflects higher interest costs of $0.07 per share, half of which related to new borrowing costs to support new investments. Energy Resources had a strong quarter of new renewables and storage origination, adding approximately 2765 to the backlog. With these additions, our backlog now totals roughly 21.5 gigawatts after taking into account 1165 MW of new projects placed into service since our last earnings call, highlighting Energy Resources ability to continue to identify attractive and accretive investment opportunities which provide strong growth visibility in the years ahead. We recently plugged 740 MW of new solar and storage projects into service which are being used to support data centers located in Arizona and New Mexico. Both of these projects are now one of the largest battery storage facilities in their respective states and in combination with their co-located solar each project enabled the local utility to serve their customers need for new, reliable, clean energy to grow their own business operations. We are proud to continue to support our power and commercial and industrial customers to meet their growing power and capacity needs create jobs and provide economic development in these local communities. Our origination activities across our power and commercial and industrial customers are beginning to reflect the rising power demand. We are seeing it manifest with our power customers in their state RFP processes and bilateral discussions where we deliver cost effective renewables and storage to their grid. We are also observing it through interactions with our oil and gas and manufacturing customers where we utilize our data and technology to help them make better siting decisions. Our technology customers have been a consistent driver of demand for many years, reflected by our roughly 3 gigawatt operating portfolio and over 3 gigawatt project backlog as we partner with them to provide various clean energy solutions based on their key business variables. We are a partner with both our power and commercial industrial customers trust. We leverage our 3 gigawatt development pipeline, our 35 gigawatt operating renewables and storage portfolio, and our transformer and switchgear procurement covering energy resources billed through 2027 to deliver projects for customers. As John said, the power demand growth is expected to be strong through at least the end of the decade. We expect 2024 to be another strong year for new renewables and storage origination. This is on the heels of two consecutive record origination years at Energy Resources. We continue to expect to remain on track for our overall renewables development expectations of roughly 33 to 42 gigawatts from 2023 through 2026. Beyond renewables and storage, NextEra Energy Transmissions was recently selected by the California ISO to develop a new a two-mile, 500 kV transmission line in Southern California, with a capital investment of more than $250 million. We believe this project could unlock over 3 gigawatts of new renewable generation capacity, supporting California's ambitious clean energy goals. This award follows a record year for NextEra Energy Transmission in 2023 and we remain excited about the opportunities ahead for this growing business. We continue to believe our ability to build, own and operate transmission is a key advantage for our renewables business. Turning now to our first quarter 2024 consolidated results, adjusted earnings from corporate and other decreased by $0.01 per share year-over-year. This quarter, we entered into an agreement to transfer approximately $1 billion of tax credits throughout 2024, representing the bulk of our expected transfers for the year. Our long-term financial expectations remain unchanged. We will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted EPS expectation ranges in 2024, 2025 and 2026. From 2021 to 2026, we continue to expect that our average annual growth in operating cash flow will be at or above our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. And as we announced in February, the Board of Directors of NextEra Energy approved a targeted growth rate in dividends per share of roughly 10% per year through at least 2026 off a 2024 base. As always, our expectations assume our caveat. Turning to NextEra Energy Partners, we continue to focus on executing against the partnerships transition plan and delivering an LP distribution growth target of 6% through at least 2026. We bought out the STX Midstream convertible equity portfolio financing in 2023 and have sufficient proceeds available from the Texas pipeline portfolio sale to complete the NEP Renewables II buyout due in June 2024 and 2025. The third convertible equity portfolio financing associated with the Meade natural gas pipeline assets is expected to be addressed in 2025. With the plan for the near-term convertible equity portfolio financings well understood, we remain focused on the partnership's cost of capital improving, which is critical for its success. With that objective in mind, we continue to evaluate alternatives to address the remaining convertible equity portfolio financing with equity buyout obligations in 2027 and beyond. Turning to the partnership's targeted 6% growth in LP distributions per unit, NextEra Energy Partners does not expect to need an acquisition this year to achieve its 6% targeted growth rate and the partnership does not expect to require growth equity until 2027. In terms of NextEra Energy Partners growth plan, as a reminder, it involves organic growth, specifically re-powering of approximately 1.3 gigawatts of wind projects through 2026, as well as acquiring assets at attractive yields. Today we are announcing plans to repower an additional approximately 100 MW of wind facilities through 2026. The partnership has now announced roughly 1085 MW of repowers. Yesterday, NextEra Energy Partners Board declared a quarterly distribution of 89.25 cents per common unit or $3.57 per common unit on an annualized basis, which reflects an annualized increase of 6% from its fourth quarter 2023 distribution per common unit. Let me now turn to the detailed results. First quarter adjusted EBITDA was $462 million and cash available for distribution was $164 million. New projects, which primarily reflect contributions from approximately 840 net megawatts of new projects that either closed in the second quarter of 2023 or achieved commercial operations in 2023, contributed approximately $32 million of adjusted EBITDA and $7 million of cash available for distribution. First quarter adjusted EBITDA contribution from existing projects declined by approximately $37 million year-over-year, driven primarily by unfavorable wind resource during the quarter and lower generation at Genesis Solar Project as a result of a planned outage for major maintenance. Wind resource was approximately 97% of long-term average versus 102% in the first quarter of 2023. The incentive distribution right fee suspension provided approximately $39 million of benefit this quarter for adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution. Finally, adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution declined by approximately $44 million and $38 million respectively, for the divestiture of the Texas pipeline portfolio. From a base of our fourth quarter 2023 distribution per common unit and an annualized rate of $3.52, we continue to see 5% to 8% growth per year in LP distributions per unit, with a current target of 6% growth per year as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2026. We continue to expect the partnerships payout ratio to be in the mid-90s through 2026. We expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2024 distribution that is payable in February 2025 to be $3.73 per common unit. NextEra Energy Partners expects run rate contributions for adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution from its forecasted portfolio at December 31, 2024 to be in the ranges of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion and $730 million to $820 million respectively. As a reminder, yearend 2024 run rate projections reflect calendar year 2025 contributions from the forecasted portfolio at year end 2024. As a reminder, our expectations are subject to our caveat. That concludes our prepared remarks and with that we will open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Steve Fleishman: Yes. Hi, thank you. Just first question just there's been press reports about potential another AD/CVD case to be filed related to solar panels and Biden also talking about getting rid of the protection on the bifacial panel tariff. Could you just talk a little bit more about how you're positioned to deal with those cases if they do arise? Changes if they arise? Thanks.
John Ketchum: Sure. Steve, this is John. I'll go ahead and take that. Let me take those in order. Let me talk about, first of all, the speculation around AD/CVD filing, which, may or may not occur, and then the bifacial exemption. But first on the AD/CVD, the bottom line takeaway for folks is that, we expect that any trade actions that would occur this time around will be very manageable and for several reasons, I'm going to go through them. This is not like circumvention. This is not circumvention 2.0. The solar panel market is in a very different spot. And the first point, I want to make is, we don't expect any trade action, if it were to occur, to result in delivery stoppages. And in any event, our panels are delivered well in advance of construction, which gives us a lot of time and opportunity to be able to troubleshoot any issues should they arise. And why do I think no stoppages are going to occur this time around? The main reason is the U.S. is the most expensive solar panel market in the world and so there's a lot of economic reasons for deliveries to continue to occur. The second point, I want to make is that given our scale, we have appropriate incentives and contractual protections that are in place in our agreements with our suppliers to ensure that delivery occurs timely. And we also don't put all of our eggs in one basket. We have a diversified set of suppliers, as you would all expect, and the ability to pivot from one supplier to another should any issues occur. So I feel like in very good spot there. Third point I want to make, and it's one that I hit in my prepared remarks, is that the U.S. and the global supply, supply of solar panels is bigger than ever and it's growing. And let me talk, for example, about the U.S. market, specifically. The U.S. domestic solar panel industry is getting stronger and stronger than it's ever been. One of the points that I made also in the prepared remarks is at the end of 2021, solar panel module capacity in the U.S. was about 8 gigawatts. That's expected to be about 50 gigawatts by the time we get to 2026. So the U.S. market is in a much different spot. There's already been 150 gigawatts of new U.S. solar panel factory announcements that have been made. If you talk to most U.S. domestic solar panel manufacturers, they're sold out through 2026. So they're certainly not having any trouble with demand, which is the other point that I want to make. So now let's speculate a little bit. So if a filing is made around anti-dumping, let me deal with that first. We find it hard to believe that any panels are being dumped into the U.S. market under the law that would be applied. As I said, the U.S. is the most expensive solar panel market in the world. It's two to three times higher than any other market in the world. And if panels were being dumped, that could not be the case. So that's the first point I want to make on anti-dumping. The second point I want to make, if there were a countervailing duty claim filed, the Department of Commerce would first have to look in to see if the price of solar modules in Southeast Asian countries, for example, were being subsidized. We don't really have any idea or way of knowing that until we see what gets filed. But, after we see those arguments, we'll be able to make a better assessment. But countervailing duties, historically, I mean, if you look at examples for countervailing duties that have been applied in the past against China suppliers, they've typically been around, 10% to 15%. So even if those were to be applied in this case, quite mean, manageable. And the other point I want to make is that what's different is tariffs in this situation would be prospective and not retroactive. And so for all of these reasons, even if something were to move forward, we still have no way of knowing if it will. We are very well positioned to manage through this, like we always do. Our inventory position and the contractual protections that we have in place are expected to give us strong coverage for our backlog through 2027. And by that time, as more and more U.S. production comes online, as expected, these trade issues will fall away. So that's AD/CVD. Let me just turn quickly to a couple of minor comments on the bifacial exemption. The bottom line, the bifacial exemption, even if it's removed, really has no impact on NextEra. Why is that? We've contracted all of our panel needs through February 26, and we have very minimal exposure to the bifacial exemption being removed. And once that bifacial exemption, even if removed, it would expire at the end of February of 2026, and it can't be brought again and reinstated for another eight years. So we feel like we're in a very good spot. And the last point I'll make is as more and more U.S. production capacity comes online and it's actually available by, we will continue to source from U.S. suppliers. So look, when you put all those things together, feel like this is very manageable and feel like we will be fine.
Steve Fleishman: That was very thorough and helpful. Thank you, John. And then I guess one other question on the data center. So you talked about the backlog edge you had this quarter. Just as we go into this year and think about this, is this going to continue to be more kind of, one off or two off quarter by quarter updates, or is there should we see more kind of potential for more, like long dated partnerships or kind of larger scale agreements? How should we think about how that might develop?
John Ketchum: I think kind of all of the above, Steve. Our opportunity is significant around data centers is a point, first point that I'll make and I think if you look historically on what we've been able to do with data center customers, I don't think anybody's had better results than we have. If you look at just our gigawatts in operation, we have 3.5 gigawatts in operation today. We have another 3, close to 3.5 gigawatts in our backlog with technology providers. We really understand their business. We really understand what it is they need. And part of that is because we spent a lot of time with them, we do business with all the, what I would call the top five hyperscalers in this country, also doing business increasingly with some of the developers of data centers as well. And we've owned data centers, and so we understand how they work, how they operate, what the CapEx and OpEx is, and how it's driven by energy and power, and what the right locations are for them. We've developed tools to address them. And so what do we see? We see about a 15% CAGR through the end of the decade for data center demand. I think data center developers are really focused more than anything on three things. They want low cost energy. They want to be able to say that they've accomplished additionality from a decarbonization standpoint, which requires a new facility to be built, not an existing facility. And third piece is it's got to be in the right location, and it's got to have speed to market. And, there's obviously been a lot of talk about renewables and nuclear, and I do want to, I'm a little more of a skeptic, about nukes, and let me explain why that is. They're already in the ground. You can't move them. And if you look at the nuclear fleet, there's only 15 nuclear plants in this country that are west of the Mississippi. And when you think about the 15 that are west of the Mississippi, most of them already rate regulated or long-term contracted. So that really is just creating maybe an east coast opportunity for those that aren't rate regulated and that aren't contracted. I think that's a small subset of nuclear units that could perhaps satisfy east coast demand. But in our discussions with data center providers, getting access to cloud capacity for Silicon Valley, Santa Clara in particular, is critical. I mean, we can all count on one or two fingers how many nuclear plants are located in those regions. Not many. And you just can't move a nuclear plant. And so the thing we bring to the table is a lot of flexibility and speed to market. We can put the renewable project exactly where it needs to be. And SMRs, I hear a lot of talk about SMRs. SMRs are still, a decade to 15 years away. Not only do you have, nine OEMs that are really struggling to access capital. If we pass a sanctions bill against Russia, a nuclear fuel that's going to limit conversion and enrichment capacity in the U.S. for sourcing of nuclear fuel for these SMRs, which also is going to require a real step up in technology to get them done, and you're also dealing with undercapitalized fuel providers. I'm a real skeptic on SMRs really coming into the picture to satisfy data center demand anytime in the near future. And so when you put all of that together, I think the right answer is renewables. In our discussions with data center developers and providers, their first focus is renewables. And I hear a lot about the reliability concerns and, well, what do you do when the wind doesn't blow and the sun doesn't shine and the four hour battery is done enough? We can overbuild the battery. We can also help work with them to design a clean energy solution where if they do have a grid by, we can green it up with wrecks, from our green desk. We have technology and tools, which we showcased back in March, where we can identify partners in the country that not only the best resource areas, but also the best fiber connectivity, the best water resource. And those are the areas that we're locking up. And we have the sites and we have the relationships. And so I don't think anybody's better positioned to capitalize on data center demand than NextEra’s. And I'm very excited about what the future opportunities hold for us there. But the other thing I would say, and we'll talk a lot more about this at our investor conference in June, is this electricity demand is real. We've been in a period of static demand for decades, and the demand is not only coming from data centers, it's coming from decoupling from China, creating more domestic manufacturing around industry, around chip manufacturing. Oil and gas industry continues to electrify. We continue to, even beyond data centers, see significant electric demand. We have the tools. We have the sites. We have the relationships, and we are chasing those opportunities. And look, we're coming off our second best origination quarter ever. I think the results speak for themselves.
Steve Fleishman: Great. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.
Shahriar Pourreza: Hey, good morning, guys.
John Ketchum: Good morning Shahriar.
Shahriar Pourreza: Good morning. Just maybe starting off on NEP, sort of given the continued pressure from capital markets and kind of the benchmark rates, are you sort of advancing any longer-term resolution plans for the CEPFs? I mean, have existing holders and maybe other infrastructure players showed any interest in transactions to fund and maybe simplify the cap structure for longer-term growth? What could that look like? And is this sort of an Analyst Day disclosure? Thanks.
John Ketchum: Yes, sure. Thanks for the question. A few comments that I'll make on it. One is we have talked about private capital raise potentially being a solution to address back in CEPFs for NEP. Obviously, there's a lot of interest in that, just given NextEra’s stature in the market, NextEra Energy Partner stature in the market. And so those discussions continue to move forward. We don't have anything to say about them right now. We may not have anything to say about them at the Analyst Day. I wouldn't expect us to make a whole lot of comments at the Analyst Day about NEP, when we do have something to say about NEP. As these discussions continue to evolve, we will address them at that point.
Shahriar Pourreza: Okay, perfect. So we'll stay tuned. And then lastly, John, on sort of the FEC, since the process disclosures had been made and obviously showed, FPL was clear of any kind of wrongdoing, there were some kind of disagreements with the FEC commissioners on the nonprofit matters. Is there an appeals path and would there be any further kind of information request to FPL or NextEra, or should we just close the books here?
John Ketchum: Yes, I think the way I look at it, Shahriar is plain and simple. FEC voted. They voted to close the matter. We're now moving on, and I think this is behind us.
Shahriar Pourreza: Okay, perfect. That's it, very comprehensive. Thank you guys, and congrats on the results.
John Ketchum: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Mr. Arcaro, your line is open. Is your phone muted accidentally? I'm sorry, we'll need to go to the next questioner. The next questioner comes from Carly Davenport with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Carly Davenport: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions today. I appreciate it. I wanted to just ask one on the backlog. Good strength in the additions this quarter and we continue to see a lot of strength in the solar and the storage piece of it. Wind has been a little bit weaker. So I guess just as you think about the difference in the returns on those projects, are there any sort of implications for your financial guidance and your plan as you think about the mix that you've seen actually evolve versus what is in that base plan?
Rebecca Kujawa: Hi Carly, it's Rebecca. I'll take that question. Good morning. Let me start with probably the most important takeaways. First, obviously, Kirk and John highlighted our continued expectations and expressed the fact that we'd be disappointed if we didn't meet the top end of those expectations as we've outlined. So that's most important. Secondly, we continue to be comfortable with the overall development expectations as we also highlighted in the prepared remarks. And that's consistent with what we've seen over time, as we've long stated. Obviously, there's a mix in technologies we, four years in advance, are not always going to be predicting exactly where we're going to be able to develop and what our customers are going to be interested in. And notably, since we laid those expectations out for the first time, a lot did change, including the passage of the IRA. And that had both an impact on changing dynamics for our customers. Buying wind, which was largely in advance, the expectations that the incentives would ultimately wind down. And in the IRA, the introduction of the production tax credit for solar, which made solar more attractive than it was even before, as well as a standalone ITC for storage, so that really spurred demand for solar and storage. But if I can kind of take a step back and kind of pile into the question that Steve answered and some of the comments that John made earlier, we are seeing significant demand across the entire U.S. economy. That of course includes data centers, technology, AI driven compute demand. But it is also manufacturing, the re-domestication of the important industries in the U.S. And it is also oil and gas and chemicals companies looking to get lower cost energy solutions into their mix that spurs a need for a lot of build. So as we look at our 300 gigawatts of products that are in development and the integrated solutions and solutions that we're designing for our customers. I remain very optimistic about all of the technologies in various parts of the country. Wind is most economic in parts of the country. It's going to be solar and storage, etcetera. So I love the portfolio approach. And from returns perspective, I think we continue to realize very attractive returns for all the technologies and of course, adjusted for the types of risks that we think we take. So mid-teens for solar and above 20% levered returns for wind and storage technologies. So I think from an investor standpoint, that's a very attractive proposition.
Carly Davenport: Awesome. Thanks for that, Rebecca. And then you mentioned in the prepared or the last question, you know, 15% CAGR for data center demand growth through the end of the decade. I guess as you think about some of these other drivers that you've mentioned of increased power demand in the U.S., how do you think that will drive kind of overall load growth? Do you have expectations there through the end of the decade?
Rebecca Kujawa: So we'll have a lot more to say in terms of our expectations and certainly in context of a number of third party views at the investor conference. But I think it's safe to say at this point that we see strong drivers for a long period of time, decades into the future, driving renewables penetration in electricity and electricity penetration into overall U.S. and energy consumption, which sets up terrific dynamics for us to continue to compete and create opportunities to invest capital for our shareholders at very attractive returns. So I love our opportunity set.
Carly Davenport: Great. Thank you for that color.
Rebecca Kujawa: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Durgesh Chopra: Good morning. Thank you for giving me time. Maybe just, Rebecca on the topic of electricity demand growth, one of the questions we consistently get, I think John hinted on this, the 15% data center growth driving it is how quickly can you ramp up? So maybe can you just talk to that? Are there any constraints, whether its equipment, whether it's sites, how quickly can the generation side of this, the renewable generation, can ramp up?
Rebecca Kujawa: Yes, Durgesh, I appreciate the question. I think a little bit of context is important. I think all of us, ourselves included, have really started talking about the significant change in load growth, really over the last year, maybe even the last six months. And you all very much appreciate that a development business, anything connecting to electrical infrastructure, usually talks in terms of years and sometimes a lot of years, depending on the market, to get something into place in the ERCOT [ph] market is maybe a couple of years and some markets in the Midwest that have had congested queues and some transmission constraints. That could be five to seven years. And obviously we've been working for a period of time. I think we're the least behind of anybody with our 300 gigawatt portfolio, but some of this will take some time to materialize. I feel very confident in long term trends. I feel really excited and pleased with our team's preparedness in terms of the development of that pipeline. And I very much think our competitive advantages that John highlighted on scale, experience, and technology really position us well in the types of conversations we're having with our customers, creating this long term visibility into demand dynamics. You guys asked John the question about data centers and how competitive we are with them. They are not looking for projects anymore. They are looking for integrated solutions that solve long-term problems for them, and we are a perfect partner for them with which to work.
Durgesh Chopra: That's very helpful, Rebecca. And then maybe just a quick follow up. I think you made comments around very healthy returns. Are you seeing higher returns, higher margins with your data center clients versus your other clients? I mean, some of your peers have highlighted high returns there. Maybe just comment on that.
Rebecca Kujawa: I continue to believe we have very attractive returns across the board, consistent with the comments that I've made today, as well as the comments we made at our development 101-day and included in our monthly updates for investor materials. So mid-teens and solar, and above 20% for both wind and storage, of course, as we talk with customers and we have unique solutions that solve particular problems that we have, we design the solutions to meet those needs and always stay focused at the end of the day on what's the attractive value proposition from an investor standpoint and we remain disciplined around that. So I love the portfolio, I love positioning, and I believe what we ultimately deliver for investors is very attractive.
Durgesh Chopra: That is very helpful. Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Excuse me, Mr. Tonet, your line is open. Is your phone…? Thank you.
Jeremy Tonet: Good morning. I just want to start off on storage originations coming in quite strong and if there's any?
Rebecca Kujawa: Hey, Jeremy, it's Rebecca. I'm going to go for the presumptive close on the answer. Hopefully it's the question you actually asked. Storage origination is very strong, as Kirk highlighted in some of the prepared remarks, and John commented in Q&A, as we think about our customers’ needs for energy and capacity, it remains a very attractive value proposition to incorporate storage to firm up renewables, either co located or separate so we're seeing terrific origination from an energy resources perspective and we've also talked today about the attractiveness of storage at FPL. So I'll hand it off to Armando to give some additional color.
Armando Pimentel: Thanks, Rebecca. So I would add, if you recall John and Kirk's comments, we filed our 10 year site plan, which we do every year. Our 10 year site plan this year had the same amount of solar that it did last year, which is a lot of solar, 21 gigs over the next 10 years. But we doubled the amount of storage, up to 4 gigawatts of storage that we have in our plan. We increasingly see storage as an economical addition in our service area. My expectations are that as time goes on, that we would likely add more storage to our plans going forward, because it is that attractive in the overall economics, especially as we add solar, which again, continues to be the best proposition from a cost standpoint for our customers.
Jeremy Tonet: Thank you for that. Just going back to the renewable development day or for people that weren't able to make it, any particular points I want to highlight?
Rebecca Kujawa: Jeremy, you broke up a little bit, so I'm going to again guess a little bit on what the question was, but I'm assuming it was what were some of the key takeaways from the development 101-day. And I hope it was a worthwhile time for our investors. We certainly were so proud of our team and talking about what it is that we believe differentiates us as we talk to our customers. And it really was around that scale experience and technology, not just individually, how all of those are important, but also how they interact with one another. So as John highlighted, the scale advantages comes the ability to deploy technologies that are unique and with experience, we actually are able to invest in capturing that data that we get from scale and put in technologies to actually get some really cool insights. So I think the key takeaway, from my perspective, is significant load growth. Certainly some opportunities to put deploy that scale experience of technology, to deploy unique and compelling solutions to our customers, so I love our growth prospects. I love the position that we have, just as John highlighted in his comments and look forward to telling you more at the investor conference in June.
Jeremy Tonet: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session and the NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners LP earning conference call. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-01-25 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the NextEra Energy Inc and NextEra Energy Partners LP Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to, Kristin Rose, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Kristin Rose : Thank you, Andrea. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2023 combined earnings conference call for NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. With me this morning are John Ketchum, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; Kirk Crews, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; Rebecca Kujawa, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources; and Mark Hickson, Executive Vice President of NextEra Energy, all of whom are also officers of NextEra Energy Partners, as well as Armando Pimentel, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light Company. John will provide some opening remarks and will then turn the call over to Kirk for a review of our fourth quarter and full year results. Our executive team will then be available to answer your questions. We will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call in the Risk Factors section of the accompanying presentation or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found on our websites, www.nexteraenergy.com and www.nexteraenergypartners.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. Today's presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of historical non-GAAP measures to the closest GAAP financial measure. With that, I will turn the call over to John.
John Ketchum: Thanks, Kristen, and good morning. NextEra Energy has strong operational and financial performance at both FPL and Energy Resources in 2023. NextEra Energy delivered full year adjusted earnings per share of $3.17, up over 9% from 2022, exceeding the high end of our adjusted EPS expectations range. From solar supply chain challenges to higher inflation and interest rates, NextEra Energy navigated through a challenging environment for the last two years, delivering compound annual adjusted EPS growth of roughly 11.5% since 2021. These were unprecedented events for our sector and clear headwinds for renewables, but disruption often presents opportunity. At NextEra Energy, we relied on our 25 years of renewables experience and our culture of execution to navigate this tough environment. On the strengths of our scale and competitive advantages, our world class supply chain capabilities, customer relationships, access to and cost of capital advantages, the strength of our balance sheet, our data driven development playbook, and our team just to a name few we successfully manage through the disruption. Our scale and competitive advantages served as key differentiators and allowed us to continue to deliver for our customers and extend our long track record of earnings and dividend growth. Over the past 10 years, we have delivered compound annual growth and adjusted EPS of roughly 10%, which is the highest among all top 10 power companies. Over that same period, the remaining top 10 power companies have achieved, on average, compound annual growth and adjusted EPS of roughly 2%. Notwithstanding the strong adjusted EPS results, we recognize and are disappointed by the underperformance in the share price. And as we start 2024, we remain steadfast in our continued focus on execution and creating long-term value for shareholders. We believe that disruption over the last two years has made NextEra Energy an even stronger company. Our business model is more resilient, our development platform is even more advanced, and our supply chain is more diversified than it has ever been. Bottom line, we believe NextEra Energy is well positioned headed into 2024. And there is good reason for optimism at NextEra Energy. Although nobody can predict with certainty what 2024 will bring, inflation and interest rates have declined from their peak, and NextEra Energy has taken steps to mitigate its exposure to interest rate volatility through its interest rate hedging program. The Commerce Department has provided the final determination around circumvention, providing solar suppliers with more certainty around the rules and expectations of importing solar equipment. New solar supply chains have been established in the U.S. and internationally, leading to lower solar panel prices, and we see the continued longer-term push towards EVs as being incrementally positive for continued reductions in battery prices. Solar panel and battery prices have already declined by roughly 25% from their peak over the last 24 months, heading into 2024. We have proactively procured critical electrical equipment to complete our renewable projects, securing enough transformers and breakers to cover our expected build through 2027. And due to our scale and construction partnerships, we have not experienced any labor shortages impacting project timelines. Ultimately, all these tailwinds are great for customers, and we believe should drive greater renewables demand in 2024 and beyond, all on the heels of consecutive record years for new renewables originations at Energy Resources in 2022 and 2023, totaling over 17 gigawatts. NextEra Energy offers a unique value proposition with two strong businesses that we believe are strategically positioned with outstanding prospects for future growth. FPL, which represents more than two thirds of our company, is the nation's largest electric utility and continues to deliver what we believe is the best customer value proposition and one of the fastest growing states in the US. Energy Resources, the world's renewables leader, has differentiated itself in an industry in which scale, experience, and being well capitalized matters. At NextEra Energy, the plan is simple. Our two businesses are deploying capital in renewables and transmission for the benefit of customers, providing visible growth opportunities for shareholders. At FPL, we identify investment opportunities that drive value for customers and support Florida's growing economy while keeping bills approximately 30% lower than the national average. We focus on running the business efficiently and continue to lead the industry with the lowest nonfuel O&M per megawatt hour of any large utility in the nation. Our emphasis on modernizing FPL's generation fleet to improve efficiency and reduce fuel costs has saved customers over $15 billion since 2001. We continue this trend in 2023 by placing into service approximately 1, 200 megawatts of cost effective solar and expect to add roughly 4, 800 megawatts over the current rate agreement. And by 2032, we expect to increase FPL's solar from 5% of our total generation today to roughly 35% by adding over 15, 000 incremental megawatts. We are also continuing to invest in FPL's grid to make it stronger and more resilient for our customers. Almost all of FPL's transmission system has been hardened with concrete or steel towers or poles, and we continue to invest in undergrounding our distribution system to further enhance reliability and resiliency for customers. The capital plan of the current rate agreement of $32 billion to $34 billion extends our customer value proposition and provides clear visibility for growth through 2025. Beyond 2025, we continue to believe FPL is strategically well positioned as Florida remains one of the fastest growing states in the U.S. with a population growth that is expected to roughly double the national average through 2030. Florida's economy is also growing and is now the 14th largest in the world if Florida were a country. FPL is responsible for keeping the lights on for approximately $2 billion per day of Florida's GDP. These long-term growth prospects coupled with investment opportunities and renewables and transmission and distribution infrastructure enhance our best-in-class customer value proposition and support our belief that FPL is the highest quality rate regulatory utility in the country. Energy Resources' deep expertise in renewables and transmission serves as a key differentiator with customers. As a result of our data-driven development playbook, Energy Resources had a record year of new renewables and storage origination, adding approximately 9, 000 megawatts to our backlog. Driven in part by the roughly 5, 600 megawatts placed in service in 2023, Energy Resources grew adjusted earnings almost 13% versus 2022. Energy Resources continues to see strong demand and is well positioned to realize its development expectations over the four year period ending 2026. Assuming we achieve the midpoint of the range, Energy Resources will be operating a roughly 63 gigawatt renewable portfolio by the end of 2026. That would be larger than the installed renewables capacity of all but nine countries. Energy Resources also is extending its excellent track record of optimizing our existing footprint to create additional shareholder value. To date, we have repowered six gigawatts of our existing 24 gigawatt wind operating fleet, investing roughly 50% to 80% of the cost of a new build and starting a new 10 years of production tax credits, resulting in attractive returns for shareholders. By 2026, Energy Resources' wind footprint could be roughly 32 gigawatts, and with over a decade to potentially qualify for repowering, it represents a great opportunity set. We believe there are multiple opportunities to drive value from the existing footprint, multiple wind repowers, adding solar underneath existing wind and locating battery storage with existing wind and solar. And we have dedicated teams leveraging our development playbook to optimize our existing and future fleet. We can maximize existing land, permits, interconnection capacity, and operations to provide enhanced value to customers and shareholders. By 2026, Energy Resources could operate up to 53 gigawatts of generation with the potential to co-locate battery storage, which represents a great long-term opportunity, especially considering the likely future capacity needs of customers. Throughout 2023, Energy Resources also continue to build what we believe is the nation's leading competitive transmission business. As growth and renewables occur throughout the U.S., there is a growing imperative to build additional or upgrade existing transmission. 2023 was a record year for our competitive transmission business. NextEra Energy transmission was awarded projects to construct transmission in PJM, CAISO and SPP that would roughly double the investments made in the existing business. We anticipate deploying approximately $1.9 billion of capital through 2027 to complete these transmission projects, which we estimate could enable up to 12 gigawatts of new renewables. Beyond 2026, Energy Resources is strategically positioned to benefit significantly from the irreversible shift towards electrification. With renewables only comprising roughly 16% of the U.S. generating mix, Energy Resources is just getting started. Renewable penetration is expected to double to over 30% by 2030, and Energy Resources is ready. We have a substantial development pipeline, including roughly 150 gigawatts of interconnection queue positions for new renewables and storage projects. We believe Energy Resources has the most comprehensive renewable energy business in the world and is better positioned than ever to capitalize on long-term growth prospects. FPL and Energy Resources individually have executed well, delivering value for our customers, both businesses complement each other, push one another to be better, and together create scale and foster innovation. We have one of the sectors strongest balance sheets and constructed and placed in the service roughly 6, 800 megawatts of new renewables and storage projects in 2023. To put that into context, 6, 800 megawatts of installed U.S. renewable generating capacity is enough on its own to rank as the fourth largest U.S. renewable energy company and the 14th largest utility. Turning to NextEra Energy Partners, we continue to focus on executing against the partnership's transition plans and delivering an LP distribution growth target of 6% through at least 2026. Last September, we made the tough decision to reduce the target distribution growth rate to 6% when NextEra Energy Partners no longer benefited from a competitive cost to capital. With a growth rate now comparable to its peers, we are focused on the partnership's cost to capital improving, which is critical for its future success. Towards that end, we are evaluating alternatives to address the remaining convertible equity portfolio financings with equity buyout obligations in 2027 and beyond. We are executing against the transition plans and with the closing of the Texas Pipeline portfolio sale, the partnership has addressed two of the three near-term convertible equity portfolio financings. The STX Midstream convertible equity portfolio financing has been extinguished and we have sufficient proceeds available to complete the NEP Renewables to buyouts that are due in June 2024 and 2025. The third convertible equity portfolio financing associated with the Meade natural gas pipeline assets is expected to be addressed in 2025. Looking ahead to 2024 and beyond, NextEra Energy Partners does not expect the need and acquisition in 2024 to meet the 6% growth and LP distributions per unit target and the partnership does not expect to require growth equity until 2027. We are executing against the growth plans and have identified approximately 985 megawatts of wind repowers through 2026 making progress against our expectations. As we turn the page on 2023 and head into 2024, we are optimistic about the renewable sector, about our opportunity set, about customer demand, and about NextEra Energy’s future. Demand for renewables has never been stronger, and yet the challenges have never been more complex, making the stakes even higher for customers. Our scale and competitive advantages are enabling us to be the partner of choice with both power and commercial and industrial customers. On March 14th, we will discuss Energy Resources development process in greater detail at our Development Investor event in Juno Beach and illustrate how our proprietary tools differentiate Energy Resources with customers. And then on June 11th, we will hold our NextEra Energy Investor Day in New York to discuss our long-term plans for both Energy Resources and FPL. Our optimism for NextEra Energy's future flows from the strength of our two world class businesses, FPL and Energy Resources, that leverage our scale and competitive advantages to differentiate themselves as leaders. Our optimism is driven from our proven playbooks of deploying capital and renewables and transmission to create value for customers. But I am most optimistic because we have spent the last two decades building a world class team at NextEra Energy, and it is, by far, our greatest competitive strength. Our team lives and breathes a culture of continuous improvement working together to solve the tough challenges of the day. We drive innovation relying on data analytics and automation to make better decisions, and we have developed and deployed smart, low cost, clean energy solutions that lead our industry. Most importantly, our team remains hyper focused on continuing our long track record of execution, serving our customers with excellence and providing long term value for shareholders. With that let me turn it over to Kirk who will review the 2023 results in more detail.
Kirk Crews : Thanks John. Let's begin with FPL's detailed results. For the full year 2023 FPL's adjusted earnings per share increased $0.22 versus 2022. FPL's adjusted earnings results exclude the approximately $300 million after tax gain on the sale of Florida City Gas which closed on November 30th 2023. The principal driver of the 2023 full year performance was FPL's regulatory capital employed growth of approximately 12.5%. We continue to expect FPL's average annual growth and regulatory capital employed to be roughly 9% over the four year term of our current rate agreement, which runs through 2025. For the full year 2023, FPL's reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.8%. During the full year 2023, we used approximately $227 million of reserve amortization, leaving FPL with a yearend 2023 balance of roughly $1.2 billion. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $2 billion in the fourth quarter, bringing its full year capital investments to a total of roughly $9.4 billion. These capital investments supported the successful commissioning of roughly 1, 200 megawatts of solar in 2023, continued hardening of the grid, and our efforts to underground our distribution system. During the fourth quarter of 2023, our 25 megawatt hydrogen pilot at the Okeechobee Clean Energy Center successfully achieved commercial operations. As a reminder, we plan to utilize this facility together with adjacent solar projects to create green hydrogen and blend it with natural gas at our Okeechobee plant. Key indicators show that the Florida economy remains strong and Florida's population continues to be one of the fastest growing in the country. Florida's economy continues to trend upward, and its GDP is now roughly $1.6 trillion, an increase of 9.3% over last year. For the fourth quarter of 2023, FPL's retail sales increased 1.6% from the prior year on a weather normalized basis, driven primarily by continued strong customer growth, which increased by nearly 81, 000 from the prior year comparable quarter. For the full year 2023, FPL retail sales increased 0.6% from the prior year on a weather normalized basis, also driven primarily by the strong customer growth in our service territory. Now, let's turn to Energy Resources, which reported full year adjusted earnings growth of approximately 12.9% year-over-year. Contributions from new investments increased by $0.35 per share due to strong growth in our renewables and storage portfolio. Contributions from our existing clean energy assets decreased results by $0.11 per share, driven primarily by the impact of weaker wind resource. 2023 was the lowest wind resource on record over the past 30 years. Our customer supply and trading business increased results by $0.16 per share, primarily due to higher margins in our customer facing businesses. Other decreased results by $0.26 per share year-over-year. This decline reflects higher interest costs of $0.22 per share, of which $0.10 was driven by new borrowing costs to support new investments. Energy Resources delivered our best year ever for origination, adding approximately 9, 000 megawatts of new renewables and battery storage projects to our backlog, which includes approximately 2, 060 megawatts since our last call. Our 2023 origination performance reflects continued strong demand from power customers looking for the least cost alternative to serve load and to replace uneconomic generation and commercial and industrial customers looking to help decarbonize their operation or meet their data center and AI demand. Our renewables backlog now stands at more than 20 gigawatts after taking into account roughly 2, 470 megawatts of new projects placed into service since our third quarter call. We believe our 20 gigawatt backlog provides clear visibility and Energy Resources’ ability to deliver for shareholders through 2026 and beyond. Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the full year adjusted earnings from our corporate and other segment decreased by $0.08 per share year-over-year, primarily driven by higher interest costs. We successfully supported the growth in our underlying businesses from our strong operating cash flows, including the sale of tax credits as well as our historical funding sources. In 2023, we grew cash flow from operations well in excess of our adjusted earnings. We transferred approximately $400 million of tax credits, establishing relationships with numerous counterparties. We believe this will prove to be a competitive advantage as buyers look first to NextEra Energy given its size, experience, and the overall quality of its tax credit program. Overall, our funding plans for 2024 through 2026 remain consistent with the information we shared on the third quarter earnings call. We continue to believe NextEra Energy is well positioned to manage the interest rate environment. While the recent decline in interest rates is encouraging, we remain committed to managing the business to deliver value for customers and shareholders. Overall, we believe we are well positioned with $18.5 billion of interest rate swaps and we will continue to closely monitor the interest rate environment as the clients and rates certainly represent a tail end for our sector and customers. Our long-term financial expectations remain unchanged. We will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted EPS expectation ranges in 2024, 2025, and 2026. For the last 14 consecutive years, NextEra Energy has met or exceeded its financial expectation, which is a record we are proud of. From 2021 to 2026, we continue to expect that our average annual growth and operating cash flow will be at or above our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. And we also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at roughly 10% per year through at least 2024 off a 2022 base. As always, our expectations assume our caveats. Now let's turn to NextEra Energy Partners. In terms of the transition plans, NextEra Energy Partners closed the sale of Texas pipeline portfolio in late December, providing net proceeds of approximately $1.4 billion. NextEra Energy Partners expect to complete the NEP Renewables II buyouts of roughly $190 million and $950 million on their stated minimum buyout dates of June 2024 and 2025, respectively, as the partnerships continue to benefit from the low cash coupon through 2025. In terms of NextEra Energy Partners ' growth plan, as a reminder, it involves organic growth, specifically repowerings of approximately 1.3 gigawatt of wind projects through 2026, as well as acquiring assets at attractive yields. Today, we are announcing plans to repower an additional approximately 245 MW of wind facilities through 2026. The partnership has now announced roughly 985 MW of repowers with strong cash available for distribution yields. While the partnership does not expect to need an acquisition in 2024, the LP distribution growth target of 6% is supported, in part with roughly 175 MW of wind repowers, which are expected to generate attractive cash available for distribution yields. Finally, we were pleased with the high yield note issuance of $750 million, which was completed during the fourth quarter of 2023. This opportunistic refinancing allowed the partnership to pay off its corporate revolver in mid-December. Let me now turn to the financial results for NextEra Energy Partners. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $454 million, and cash available for distribution was $86 million. Adjusted EBITDA growth versus the prior year comparable quarter was primarily due to new asset additions and the incentive distribution's right fee suspension, while cash available for distribution was also impacted by incremental debt service. For the full year 2023, adjusted EBITDA was approximately $1.9 billion, up 13.6% year-over-year, and was primarily driven by the contribution for new projects acquired in late 2022 and during 2023 and the Incentive Distribution Right Fee Suspension. New investments added approximately $228 million and the Incentive Distribution Right Fee Suspension added approximately $113 million of adjusted EBITDA year-over-year. This growth was partially offset by a decline from existing projects driven primarily by weaker wind resource. Cash available for distribution was $689 million for the full year and primarily driven by contributions from new projects of approximately $42 million and the Incentive Distribution Right Fee Suspension of $113 million while being partially offset by the weaker wind resource. Yesterday, the NextEra Energy Partners Board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.88 per common unit or $3.52 per unit on an annualized basis, which reflects an annualized increase of 6% from its third quarter 2023 distribution per unit. The partnership grew its LP distributions per unit by more than 8% year-over-year. From an updated base of our fourth quarter 2023 distribution per common unit and an annualized rate of $3.52, we continue to see 5% to 8% growth per year in LP distributions per unit with a current target of 6% growth per year as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2026. We continue to expect the partnership payout ratio to be in the mid-90s through 2026. We expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2024 distribution that is payable in February 2025 to be $3.73 per common unit. NextEra Energy Partners is introducing December 31, 2024 run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA in a range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion and cash available for distribution in a range of $730 million to $820 million reflecting calendar year 2025 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at year end 2024. As a reminder, our expectations are subject to our caveat. That concludes our prepared remarks and with that, we will open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Shahriar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners.
Shahriar Pourreza : Good morning, guys. Just starting on NEP, if it's okay, just on the higher repowering opportunities you announced, I guess how are you sort of thinking about funding it? And really more importantly, is there any specific status on the money pool that could be looking to buy in directly into projects, whether it's dropdowns or organic growth at the NEP level? Could these sort of equity investors help solved the ‘26 growth and financing issues? And I guess when do you plan to update on that?
Kirk Crews : Sure. So with respect to repowering, Shahr, we look at that as on the project level. There are really two options there. We can look at it from a project financing standpoint and pair that with transferability, or we can look at it as tax equity. So we will look at both of those options and decide that at the time of the repowerings. With respect to your second question, there's, we're looking at all options right now, as John said, in the prepared remarks. We are exploring a number of opportunities and alternatives for addressing the convertible equity portfolio financing that are coming due in 2027 and beyond. There's really not a timeframe in terms of the update now, but we are looking at all options and with the goal of really maximizing unit holder value.
Shahriar Pourreza : Got it.
John Ketchum: And Shahr, this is John, just adding on to that again, on the repowers. Just like we do at the, I mean, just think about it as tax equity and project finance.
Shahriar Pourreza : Got it. Okay.
John Ketchum: And again, the private capital raises provide us with a number of options, but we're looking at a lot of different alternatives, that being one of them.
Shahriar Pourreza : Okay, perfect. And then lastly, John, we haven't had any updates from the FEC, has anything sort of been communicated to you regarding sort of the investigation how quickly you would look to settle, assuming they take up the case. And as we're kind of thinking about the process, right, it's confidential. So curious on how you're going to update investors, like would we see a press release or 8-K from you confirming the FEC process and that you'll update investors in the future on next steps, or could we see a single communication on the FEC pickup and a concurrent settlement, let's say? I'm just trying to assess how long this could be an overhang, assuming the case moves forward and whether you've already laid the groundwork for all options to get this kind of past this quick when a ruling comes out. Thank you.
John Ketchum: Yes, thanks for the question, Shahr. So let me just take those in order. First of all, there's no update. We have not been contacted by the FEC. And I think just to remind investors of the timing, first of all, these are just guidelines I'm going to give you. I mean, there is no prescribed timeline in terms of the FEC providing a response to us. But as you may recall, we originally received the FEC complaint, I guess is what you would call it, that had been filed by a group called CREW back in November of 2022. And if you follow the historical precedent of the FEC, it's usually 12 to 18 months after you first are notified of a complaint having been filed, that you would learn whether or not the FEC decides to find that there's reason to believe that they ought to conduct an investigation. We have not heard anything from the FEC in that regard. The second thing I would remind investors of is this is not material again these were five allegations totaling political contributions of roughly $1.3 million to $1.5 million. So we're talking about smaller dollar amounts and how and when we would update investors would depend on what exactly we hear from the FEC.
Operator: The next question comes from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research.
Steve Fleishman: Yes, hi. Good morning. Thanks. I guess a couple of big picture questions. First, obviously a lot more focus in the elections now as we're in ‘24 and curious your thoughts in the event of Republican trifecta so to speak just how you're thinking about the sustainability of IRA provisions.
John Ketchum: Sure, Steve. Let me go ahead and take that, this is John. First of all in the 21 years I've been at the company, as we've changed administrations and we've seen changes in Congress, we've never seen a change or appeal of tax credits. No matter what form they've taken, IRA is the form we're talking about here. So that's the first point I would make. Second, it's really hard to overturn existing law. I think Obamacare is a very good example of that. It's just very difficult no matter what the political wins are. The third point I would make is that the IRA benefits both sides of the aisle. It certainly is advantageous for obvious reasons for Democrats, but it also has a big benefit to Republicans. Because if you think about where the investments are being made around IRA and where a lot of the benefit of IRA is flowing, it's flowing to Republican states and it's flowing to parts of those states that are really difficult to stimulate economically. And we're talking about rural communities in these states. And so when we come in and we build a wind project, we build a solar project, we build a battery storage project, it's a complete turnaround for these communities. We're providing an economic base in the form of jobs. We're providing an economic base in the form of spending that occurs in that community. We're providing an economic base in the form of property taxes and sales tax revenues. These are 180s for these rural communities and make a huge difference on their viability going forward. Just think about hospitals and staffing doctors at county hospitals or teach -- paying teacher salaries. I mean, the property tax revenues have significant benefits. And so for those reasons, we've always been able to work with both sides of the aisle. So see any repeal of IRAs being unlikely.
Steve Fleishman: Okay. And I guess two other big picture questions on the renewable space. And it's just any kind of new thoughts color on your data center strategy and also your thoughts on hydrogen after the based on the proposed rules that came out.
Rebecca Kujawa : Good morning, Steve. It's Rebecca. First on the data centers, clearly there's an enormous amount of demand being driven across the U.S. economy by the growth in data centers, driven by a lot of things, of course, but specifically, generative AI, and that growth is pretty explosive at this point. And I think the characteristics of that demand are a little bit unique in driving different ways in approaching the marketplace for a number of these technology companies where it is imperative that these projects get built on time, on budget, and produce the energy that they're expecting because the opportunity cost for these customers is so significant if they aren't able to power them and, of course, meet the commitments that they've made to their own stakeholders. So we're seeing those relationships expand and also deepen, where it's not just signing the megawatts of the day, but also working with them collaboratively over a long period of time to ensure that they get the energy and capacity that they need where they needed to support their projects. Just alone in our backlog, not even counting what we have installed, we have over three gigawatts of projects that we're building in the coming years for these customers. And I do believe that's the tip of the iceberg. And again, not even talking about what we already have installed. So it's pretty exciting. And our team is very ingrained in working with these customers. And we're excited about the years ahead. And then turning to hydrogen, obviously the guidance that first came out, the draft guidance in December, is really steering towards hydrogen projects that will be essentially from day one, needing to match on an hourly basis. And that, of course, increases the ultimate cost of hydrogen. And unfortunately, I think if it stands as currently drafted, would limit to an extent how much will be built for the U.S. market. We're obviously advocating more of a relaxed matching requirements of more of an annual match for a period of time and then transitioning to hourly over time so that you can kick start a hydrogen market. And hopefully the administration will hear that and know that having a kick started hydrogen economy will certainly further their ambitious goals, which of course we are very excited about meeting to see the full decarbonization of the U.S. economy over time. So more work to be done and we are excited to pursue the marketplace. Regardless, these are probably end of the decade type projects, so more of an investment in the near term for opportunities in the long term.
Operator: The next question comes from David Arcaro of Morgan Stanley.
David Arcaro: Hey, good morning. Thanks so much for taking my question. Maybe on the renewables demand side of things, could you give a little bit more detail on the origination trends that you're seeing? I guess it looked like solar and storage quite strong in the quarter, but then wind a little bit lower in terms of the new bookings added. Maybe what's your latest confidence in achieving those ‘25 and ‘26 targets, particularly on the wind side of the business?
Rebecca Kujawa : Hey, David. It's Rebecca. I'll take a first cut at that. We're obviously excited about the origination, as John and Kirk have highlighted, originating 17 gigawatts over the last two years, and both years serving as a record, so this year topping last year's record is very exciting. We also, of course, see the mix being more focused towards solar and storage, and as I've commented in the past, I think some of this is an after effect of the strong demand that we saw going into 2020 when we and others thought that the production tax credit would ultimately phase down and then ultimately go to zero over a period of time, so there was a pull forward of demand. And then the second dynamic that I think has impacted the short term is that the solar production tax credit clearly stimulated near-term demand and deployments for our customers, and obviously we're very excited about that. Storage is growing at least as well as we thought, perhaps exceeding even our expectations in terms of adoption, not just in the Western markets, but now really spreading in a very constructive way through the Midwest, and we've got, as John highlighted in the prepared remarks, a really advantaged position to be able to respond quickly to the demand characteristics that we're seeing where our customers need capacity quickly, where they hadn't anticipated the demand that they would see in their underlying business. And so getting to market quickly is very much a premium and a priority, and we're there to serve them well. In that storage market, as we've talked about from a returns characteristic standpoint, it's an awful lot like wind, and it's certainly complex to deliver the value that our customers are looking for in the various streams. I'd say the other part that is at least as strong as we anticipated when we laid out the expectations is repowering. And we're excited about the economics of that and economics specifically in context to the value that it brings to our customers, bringing some incremental generation and extending the life of these projects, often extending the contracts with our customers at the same times that we do repowering. So overall, with all those comments in context, I feel really good about meeting our development expectations in aggregate. We'll continue to look at the mix in individual technologies over time. But at this point, we are obviously leaving the ranges as we've had them now for a couple of years, in part to reflect what I'm sure you recall, wind is a very short development cycle. Maybe not the actual laying the groundwork to be able to build a project, but when we enter into a contract and acquire the term and put it into service, it can be as short as nine months. So there's still a lot of time left between now and the end of ‘26 to add more wind to not only the backlog, but ultimately commission. And when I look at the forward couple of quarters, there are a couple of chunky opportunities that our teams are working on, and I feel good about bringing them some of those to fruition.
David Arcaro: Excellent. Thanks for that. Very helpful. And then maybe secondarily, just it sounds like the backdrop has gotten more challenging for small developers in the renewable space, wondering if you're seeing opportunities for market share gain as a result, and potentially any development pipelines to pick up from developers that might be struggling right now.
Rebecca Kujawa : Sure. We always are out in the development right acquisition market. In the recent couple of years, we've really prioritized our greenfield portfolio, in part because of our ability to work so closely with our customers and make sure that we're building the projects over the long term where they need them. But we will always be opportunistic in the development project market to be selective and create opportunities where it may be particularly attractive. The dynamic from a couple of years ago where a number of the development portfolios were acquired by folks looking to, I would say, compete with us, but certainly have a bigger presence on the development side. We haven't seen those holistically come back to market. I think that may change over time. I know the private equity cycle of wanting to be able to turn over capital quickly and realize isn't necessarily completely aligned with the development cycle where sometimes things are a little bit faster or a little bit slower than you anticipated, and you need to be patient. So I'm optimistic there'll be opportunities. But most importantly, and this is one of the things that we'll focus on in March, is we want to keep our fate, our development opportunities in our own hands. And I am super excited about what our team is working on from a greenfield development standpoint and the competitive advantages that we're investing in to make sure that we can serve our customers well, not just in the next two or three years as we often talk about with you all, but the next five, seven, 10 years plus down the road.
Operator: The next question comes from Carly Davenport of Goldman Sachs.
Carly Davenport: Hey, good morning. Thanks so much for taking the questions. I wanted to just ask about transmission. You highlighted the $1.9 billion of capital through ‘27 at NEER. And as we look at the EBITDA contributions at NEER for 2024 that piece is moving higher as well. So could you just talk a bit about what sort of growth you could see at NEER over the next several years and what that EBITDA contribution could be over time?
Rebecca Kujawa : Good morning, Carly. So from the pipeline perspective, is no doubt you appreciate transmission opportunities take a couple of years to come to fruition. So we're thrilled with the awards that the team has been able to secure in the last year on one part of it, building on investments that we already have, so expansion opportunities that are significantly enabling new renewables development headed into the California market. And then other parts of the US competitive opportunities that we won through competitive processes. In terms of timing, as we highlighted in the prepared remarks, the in -service dates are out to 2027. So as we invest capital, obviously that'll start to become more of a material contribution over time. And we'll give more color as we get into the investor conference as we typically do to give more of a breakdown by business and what those contributions will look like over time. But the momentum is terrific. And as we've highlighted, everybody understands, maybe not to the extent that we think it's going to happen, but in order to unlock the renewables opportunity that we and others see across the United States, transmission needs to be built. And we stand ready to be a part of the solution wherever we can be and bring cost effective solutions to customers.
Carly Davenport: Great, thank you for that. And then maybe just one more on the financing side for this year, just based on what you've seen so far in the markets, how are you thinking about the mix of the different avenues that you can use to monetize tax credits, whether through tax equity or transferability? How do we think about the sort of magnitude of each of those in your financing plans for ‘24?
Kirk Crews : Yes, Carly, this Kirk, the financing plan as we shared in our prepared remarks is consistent with the information, we shared on the third quarter call. And as we approach those options, we will use the historical approaches, project finance and tax equity. But we're also very encouraged by what we're seeing with the transferability market. We are having really good progress with, in those conversations, we're seeing really good demand for the NextEra Energy tax credit. And ultimately, we look at all those as options and will optimize between project finance and transferability and tax equity. And we'll use those within the ranges that we shared and the ‘24 to ‘26 funding plan that we provided between those -- between the disclosure that we provided. But we are seeing really good demand for the credits and expect to continue to utilize transferability as an option going forward.
Operator: The next question comes from Jeremy Tonet of JPMorgan.
Jeremy Tonet: Hi. Good morning. Just wanted to build off that a little bit as what you talked about before. How do you balance, I guess, looking forward the wealth of growth opportunities and associate funding needs relative to dividend growth? Do you look at industry trends for dividend growth at all and how that might change as utility CapEx increases and just a final point there, just wondering how the EMP business competes for capital against everything else that you have in a lower gas price environment.
Kirk Crews : Sure. So we, when we look at capital allocation and you look at, we shared on the third quarter call the returns that we see within the renewable business and as we shared then at Energy Resources within for when we see returns in the low 20s on a levered ROE basis. In solar, we see returns in the mid-teens and then storage is also in the low 20s. And so it's great returns and we look to get capital allocated to the renewable business. And that as John discussed in the prepared remarks, we are allocating capital across both businesses in renewables and transmission. And so that is the priority with the way that we allocate capital. And then in terms of the funding of that, again, it's the way that we've traditionally funded the business, it’s tax equity, it’s project finance, and then we also use the transferability provisions.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. Thank you for that. And then maybe just pivoting a little bit towards the backlog. A lot of additions in the quarter, but there was a little bit of fell out, I think, 350 and there was a little bit more in the post 2026 timeframe that's in the backlog. So just wondering if you could talk a bit more on kind of some of the drivers, the puts and takes within the portfolio addition composition over time.
Rebecca Kujawa : Sure, I'll take that. In terms of the, obviously the backlog additions are quite strong and we're thrilled about that. And for this quarter, in terms of the removal that we had, it's really project specific items and one part is really related to higher interconnection costs for a particular project where we need to go back and do a little bit more work, very likely these project megawatts will come back into the backlog. They're good projects, but in near term we're removing them while we work through the issues. We, I think it's important to keep in mind that as we add something to the backlog, it's tremendous visibility and we're really excited about moving forward with the projects based on what we know at the time. But this is still a development business and there are things that you have to work through before you commit significant capital to a project and occasionally some of those things that we work through are better. Sometimes they're a little bit worse and we need to make the decisions that are ultimately right for our shareholders at the time that we need to make them. So in context of a 20 plus gigawatt portfolio, I think it's de minimis for what is kind of the normal run rate for development type issues. And fortunately we've worked through the issues that we had talked about over the last two years around anti -dumping, countervailing duties and the significant changes in the marketplace related to the inflationary pressures and changes in the interest rates. So at this point I think we're in kind of like normal development, every once in a while, there's something that changes our view on a specific project and we're going to do the right thing from a shareholder perspective and only commit capital where it makes sense.
Operator: This concludes our question and answer session. The conference has now also concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation and you may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-10-24 09:00:00) =====

With that, I will turn the call over to Kirk.
Kirk Crews: Thanks Kristin and good morning. NextEra Energy delivered strong third-quarter results, growing adjusted earnings per share approximately 10.6% year-over-year. In the quarter, FPL continued to deliver outstanding value to its customers in what we believe has been one of the most constructive regulatory jurisdictions in the nation. FPL's bills are well below the national average, and we are relentlessly focused on reliability and running the business efficiently. Energy Resources extended its leadership position in renewable energy during the third quarter with strong adjusted earnings growth and its best renewables and storage origination quarter in its history. NextEra Energy has clear growth visibility through FPL's capital plan and Energy Resources' over 21 gigawatt renewables and storage backlog. With the strongest balance sheets in the sector and worldwide banking relationships, we believe NextEra Energy has both significant access to capital and cost-of-capital advantages and is well positioned to continue to deliver long-term value for shareholders. Now let's turn to FPL's detailed results. For the third quarter of 2023, FPL's earnings per share increased $0.04 year-over-year. The principal driver of this performance was FPL's regulatory capital employed growth of approximately 13.6% year-over-year. We continue to expect FPL to realize roughly 9% average annual growth in regulatory capital employed over our current rate agreement's four-year term, which runs through 2025. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $2.6 billion for the quarter, and we expect FPL's full-year 2023 capital investments to be between $9 billion and $9.5 billion. For the 12 months ending September 2023, FPL's reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.8%. During the third quarter, we reversed roughly $245 million of reserve amortization, leaving FPL with a balance of over $1.2 billion. Over the current four-year settlement agreement, we continue to expect FPL to make capital investments of between $32 billion to $34 billion. Our capital investment plan is well-established and focused on enhancing what we believe is one of the best customer value propositions in the industry. Key indicators show that the Florida economy remains healthy and Florida continues to be one of the fastest-growing states in the country. FPL's third-quarter retail sales increased 3% from the prior year-comparable period due to warmer weather, which had a positive year-over-year impact on usage for customer of approximately 2%. As a result, FPL observed solid underlying growth in third quarter retail sales of roughly 1% on a weather normalized basis. Now let's turn to energy resources, which reported adjusted earnings growth of approximately 21% year-over-year. Contributions from new investments increased $0.11 per share year-over-year, while our existing clean energy portfolio declined $0.02 per share, which includes the impact of weaker year-over-year wind resource. The comparative contribution from our customer supply and trading and gas infrastructure businesses increased by $0.04 per share and $0.01 per share respectively. All other impacts reduced earnings by $0.08 per share. This decline reflects higher interest costs by $0.06 per share, half of which is driven by new borrowing costs to support new investments. Energy resources had a record quarter of new renewables and storage origination at approximately 3,245 megawatts to the backlog, which is the first time we have exceeded three gigawatts in a single quarter. Although we will remind you that signings can be lumpy quarter-to-quarter, we do believe this is a terrific sign of strong underlying demand for new renewable generation. With these additions, our backlog now totals over 21 gigawatts after taking into account roughly 1,025 megawatts of new projects placed into service since our second quarter call. We also removed roughly 1,180 megawatts from our backlog, including roughly 800 megawatts of projects in New York following an adverse decision by NYSERDA two weeks ago. We are optimistic that these projects will ultimately move forward, but are removing them from backlog for now. The remaining megawatts were removed due to permitting challenges. Overall, we remain on track to achieve our renewable development expectations of roughly 33 gigawatts to 42 gigawatts through 2026. This quarter's backlog additions include roughly 455 megawatts to repower existing wind facilities, which includes energy resources share of approximately 740 megawatts of repowers within the NextEra Energy Partners portfolio, which I'm going to discuss in a few minutes. As a reminder, in a repower, we invest roughly 50% to 80% of the cost of a new build, are able to refresh and enhance the performance of the turbine equipment, and start a new 10 years of production tax credits, collectively resulting in attractive returns. Energy Resources has previously repowered roughly 6 gigawatts of its approximately 23 gigawatt operating wind portfolio, and we believe we will be able to repower much of our existing wind portfolio in the coming years. Also included in the backlog additions are roughly 250 megawatts of standalone battery storage projects co-located with existing wind and solar facilities. The combination of the standalone storage tax credit and the ability to utilize existing interconnection capacity from our operating renewables and storage footprint positions us well to serve our customers' growing needs for capacity. Turning now to our third quarter 2023 consolidated results, adjusted earnings from corporate and other decreased by $0.01 per share year-over-year. Our long-term financial expectations remain unchanged. We will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted EPS expectation ranges in each year from 2023 through 2026. From 2021 to 2026, we continue to expect that our average annual growth and operating cash flow will be at or above our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range, and we continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at roughly 10% per year for at least 2024 off a 2022 base. As always, our expectations are subject to our caveats. Going forward, we plan to fund the business in a manner similar to how we have historically done so at both FPL and Energy Resources. This includes utilizing cash flow from operations for roughly half of our funding needs, in addition to tax equity, project finance, and corporate debt. The sale of tax credits is serving as a new source of capital funding for NextEra Energy. We expect to transfer roughly $400 million in tax credits in 2023 and expect this amount to grow over the next couple of years to approximately $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion in 2026. This dynamic has reduced NextEra Energy's capital recycling needs, including those previously met via sales to NextEra Energy partners, which has historically averaged roughly $1 billion of annual cash proceeds. Let me address future equity issuances specifically. Our balance sheet and financial discipline remain core to our strategy. As we find attractive investments for our customers and shareholders, we expect to fund those investments in a way that maintains the strength of our balance sheet. As a reminder, over the last five years, we have issued roughly $1.5 billion annually on average of equity in the form of equity units. We do not expect to issue any equity for the balance of 2023 and expect our year-end credit metrics to exceed those specified by the agencies to support our current ratings. From 2024 through 2026, we would expect our total equity needs to be no more than $3 billion in total with continued reliance on equity units to satisfy our equity needs, which have no dilution for the first three years. We believe FPL and Energy Resources are well-positioned to manage interest rate volatility in the current environment. At FPL, we primarily rely on the surplus mechanism to offset higher interest rates for the benefit of customers. In addition, FPL's rate agreement already provided for an ROE adjustment to 11.8%, enabling it to earn a higher ROE in the current higher rate environment. We expect that FPL will be able to absorb much and potentially all of the cumulative effects of the current interest rate environment through the use of the surplus mechanism over the remaining settlement period. Consistent with the expiration of the current rate agreement, FPL expects to file a rate case in early 2025 for new rates effective 2026. For Energy Resources and corporate and other, we now have $20.5 billion of interest rate hedges in place. While the amounts vary as we add and settle hedges, the tenor of the swaps are between five years and ten years and have a weighted average rate of roughly 3.75%. Swaps allow us to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes on energy resources backlog returns and capital holdings $12.8 billion of debt maturities from 2024 through 2026. Specifically, these swaps allow us to hedge the project-level debt funding we expect to issue on our renewables backlog as well as a portion of the $12.8 billion of the term maturities. To put this all in perspective, NextEra Energy's sensitivity for an immediate 50 basis point upward shift in the yield curve has essentially no expected adjusted EPS impact on 2023 and 2024 and has on average $0.03 to $0.05 of expected adjusted EPS impact in 2025 and 2026, which is equivalent to approximately 1% of our adjusted EPS expectations. This sensitivity, of course, assumes we do not implement other offsetting initiatives, including among others, our normal process of cost reductions and capital efficiency opportunities. Our backlog is in good shape and is benefiting from our interest rate swaps, global supply chain management capabilities, and the ability to procure equipment, materials and balance of plant services at scale across our portfolio. The expected returns on equity for our backlog are mid-teens for solar and over 20 for wind and storage. As we have done historically, we price our power purchase agreements commensurate with current market conditions, including our current cost of capital in order to maintain appropriate returns. In addition, at the time of our final investment decision, before we commit significant capital to our backlog projects, we are utilizing interest rate swaps on contracts that we were entered into when rates were lower to maintain our return expectations. We remain financially disciplined and pass on projects that don't meet our return expectations. Going forward, we are encouraged by the trends we are seeing in lower equipment pricing for solar panels and batteries, given increased competition globally, and declining prices for materials, which we believe will help offset the impacts of higher interest rates on power purchase agreement prices. We are optimistic that demand will remain resilient due to the factors you all know well, including the continued cost competitiveness of renewable energy, relative to alternative forms of generation. Importantly to date, demand has remained strong, as evidenced by our substantial new additions to backlog this quarter. Now let's turn to NextEra Energy Partners. As a reminder, the partnership is a financing vehicle that grows its distribution by acquiring assets with long-term contracted high-quality cash flows and financing those acquisitions at low cost. Over the years, NextEra Energy Partners has been able to rely on low-cost financing to help drive its distribution growth. To meet its financing needs in recent years, the partnership has relied primarily on convertible equity portfolio financing that have a low cash coupon during their term and convert into equity over time. A significant amount of the equity required to be issued to buy out these financings began coming due this year and over the next several years, which we believe contributed to the partnership's trading yield almost doubling at the same time interest rates were rising. Consequently, the partnership's cost of capital increased, which made it difficult to support a 12% growth rate in a way that is sustainable and in the best interest of unit holders over the long term. By reducing the growth rate to 6%, NextEra Energy Partners LP distribution rate is now comparable to its peers, and the partnership does not expect to require growth equity until 2027. In order to meet these objectives, the partnership is focused on first executing against its transition plan. As a reminder, the transition plans include successfully entering into agreement to sell the Texas natural gas pipeline portfolio and natural gas pipeline assets this year and in 2025, respectively. Doing so will enable the partnership to address the equity buyouts associated with the FPL's midstream, the 2019 NEP pipelines and NEP renewables to convertible equity portfolio financing through 2025. Through the period of our current financial expectations, that would leave a small equity buyout of roughly $147 million on the genesis holding convertible equity portfolio financing in 2026. The partnership is continuing its process to sell the Texas pipeline portfolio and expects to have an update on or before our fourth quarter call in January. NextEra Energy Partners is focused on executing against its growth plan for unit holders. That plan involves organic growth, specifically repowering of approximately 1.3 gigawatts of wind projects, as well as acquiring assets from energy resources or third parties at favorable yields. Importantly, NextEra Energy Partners does not expect to need an acquisition in 2024 to meet the 6% growth in distributions per unit target. Today, we're announcing plans to repower approximately 740 megawatts of wind facilities through 2026, which require the final approval of the customer's [ph] board of directors, which is expected to be received in the near term. The repowerings are projected to generate attractive CAFD yields and the partnership expects to fund the repowerings with either tax equity or project-specific debt. Repowerings represent an efficient way to support the partnership's growth targets. Overall, we are pleased with this progress and remain focused on executing additional repowering opportunities in the future across NextEra Energy Partners' roughly 8-gigawatt wind portfolio. To minimize the volatility associated with the changes in interest rates and support the growth plan, the partnership also executed roughly $1.9 billion to hedge refinancing costs for the 2024 and 2025 maturities. The resulting expected refinancing costs of the maturities are factored into our expectations. Turning to the detailed results, NextEra Energy Partners' third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $488 million and cash available for distribution was $247 million. New projects, which primarily reflect contributions from approximately 1,100 net megawatts of new long-term contracted renewable projects acquired in 2022 and the approximately the 690 net megawatts of new projects that closed in the second quarter of this year, contributed approximately $66 million of adjusted EBITDA and $32 million of cash available for distribution. The third quarter adjusted EBITDA contribution from existing projects increased by approximately $5 million year-over-year. Third quarter results for adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distributions were positively impacted by the incentive distribution rights fee suspension and provided approximately $39 million of benefit this quarter, more than offsetting the cash available for distribution impacts of lower pay-go payments driven by lower wind resource at existing projects. Yesterday, NextEra Energy Partners' board declared a quarterly distribution of 86.75 cents per common unit or $3.47 per common unit on an annualized basis, which reflects an annualized increase of 6% from its second quarter 2023 distribution per common unit. From a base of our second quarter 2023 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $3.42, we continue to see 5% to 8% growth per unit per year in LP distributions per unit, with a current target of 6% growth per year, being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2026. For 2023, we expect an annualized rate for the fourth quarter 2023 distribution that is payable in February of 2024 to be $3.52 per common unit. NextEra Energy Partners expects run rate contributions for adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distributions from its forecasted portfolio at December 31, 2023 to be in the range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion and $730 million to $820 million, respectively. As a reminder, year-end 2023 run rate projections reflect calendar year 2024 contributions from the forecasted portfolio at year-end 2023. The adjusted EBITDA and related cash available for distributions associated with the Texas Pipeline portfolio have been excluded from these run rate financial expectations. As always, our expectations are subject to our caveat. While NextEra Energy Partners navigates through this current environment, it's important not to lose sight of the value of the underlying portfolio. NextEra Energy Partners is the seventh largest producer of electricity from the wind and the sun in the world, with over 10 gigawatts of renewables in operation. The partnership owns renewable projects that deliver high-quality cash flows in 30 states, serving 94 customers with an average counterparty credit rating of BBB plus via contracts with an average remaining contract life of 14 years. We remain optimistic the partnership can be an attractive vehicle to own existing renewable assets over the long term. We want the partnership to be successful, and separately, to address a question we've been receiving from some investors, NextEra Energy has no plans to buy back NextEra Energy Partners. With that, I'll turn the call over to John.
John Ketchum: Thanks, Kirk. Let me briefly address NextEra Energy Partners. It's been a difficult year, and we have a lot of work to do. As Kirk shared, we are focused on executing against our transition plans and look forward to providing an update on the Texas Pipeline portfolio sales process on or before the fourth quarter earnings call. We are also focused on delivering LP distribution growth of 6% through at least 2026, and the repowerings we announced today are a good start towards achieving that objective. At NextEra Energy, our foundations are rooted in FPL, the nation's largest electric utility, and NextEra Energy Resources, the world's leader in renewables. Both businesses have performed very well, complement each other, and push one another to be even better. This is validated by the solid financial and operating results both continue to deliver and the excellent progress we are making against our development expectations. Over recent weeks, we met with many of our investors and have welcomed your feedback. In response, we addressed many of the questions we heard from you in our remarks today and in the presentation materials you now have. Along those lines, I want to reiterate the solid fundamentals on which NextEra Energy is built and our outstanding prospects for future growth, having just completed our annual strategy review process with our board of directors. FPL remains among the best utilities in the United States, achieving top operational performance across key metrics while maintaining the industry's lowest cost structure, one of the cleanest emissions profiles, and a customer bill that is roughly 30% lower than the national average. It is located in one of the fastest growing states with what we believe is one of the country's most constructive regulatory environments. FPL has by far the lowest non-fuel O&M of any large utility in the nation. Over the last 20 years, our relentless focus on cost, efficiency and low bills have saved customers nearly $15 billion in fuel cost alone. Year after year, FPL receives top accolades for reliability, despite operating on a peninsula and historically facing a high probability for hurricanes. It has plans to add approximately 20 gigawatts of solar over the next 10 years for the benefit of its customers while undergrounding its distribution system to lower operating costs and withstand the impacts of hurricanes to help keep the Florida economy, which is now the 16th largest in the world, running on all cylinders. We believe FPL is the highest quality regulated utility in the country. At Energy Resources, we are just getting started. Renewable penetration as part of the US generating mix currently stands at roughly 16% and is expected to double, reaching over 30% by 2030. As the world's leader in renewable energy with an approximately 20% market share in US renewables origination, Energy Resources stands to benefit significantly from the unstoppable shift towards electrification. Experience and scale matter, and with over 20 years of renewables experience, a 31 gigawatt operating portfolio, a development pipeline of roughly 300 gigawatts of renewables and storage projects, and roughly 150 gigawatts of interconnection queue positions we are well positioned for future growth. In addition to our scale and competitive advantages that you all know well, our ability to finance cheaper with one of the strongest balance sheets in our sector provides us with an access to and cost of capital advantage. We believe all of this enables us to differentiate ourselves in a complex macro environment to build even more renewables at attractive returns. In short, we believe Energy Resources has built the most competitive and complete renewable energy business in the world and is in a better position than ever to lead the decarbonization of the US economy. We have spent the last two decades building a world-class clean energy platform powered by our greatest strength, our people, and a culture of continuous improvement that drives innovation and smart clean energy solutions. I want to extend my appreciation to our team today as we remain committed to serving our customers and providing long-term value for our shareholders. Thank you, and now we welcome your questions.
Operator: [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Steve Fleishman: Yeah, hi. Thank you. So just a couple questions; first on the slide on the tax transferability and the billion dollars effectively creating $6.5 billion of equity content, could you just talk to that more and just, I think if I do the backward math, that's about a 15% FFO to debt kind of calculation. Is that kind of what you're using to get to that, or is there more nuance to it?
John Ketchum: Yeah, Steve, on that slide, I'll take that. This is John. We are -- the example is a $1 dollars. You take a $1 dollars, you divide by the 18% FFO to debt, that gets you about $5.5 billion. You add the $1 billion of cash that you receive, and that gets you the $6.5 billion of equity content on a $1 billion transfer.
Steve Fleishman: Got it. Okay. And when you lay out your, that would seem to be a key part, since you talked about the transferability numbers going from $400 million to a $1.7 billion. That's a key part, and that would show up in your funding plan in the corporate debt issuances now, since it's not tax equity anymore. That might be kind of matched against that, or would it be in the tax equity and project? How do we think about where that shows up?
John Ketchum: The way I think about it is it's going to show up in your cash flow from operations. That's the cash that you actually receive, and then there's also some equity content that benefits the rest of the sources, including corporate debt issuances.
Steve Fleishman: Got it. Okay. Helpful. And then one other question on the -- so the tenor of the interest rate swap seems pretty long, which is helpful. Just, when we think of how you're using the swaps to kind of basically limit interest rate risk of the projects, how much project, if there's a $1 billion of a project, how much is project debt going forward, percent of that, let's say, that you might be using a swap against?
John Ketchum: Yeah, the way I think about it, Steve, it's 70%. So, when you think about our backlog, just some rough math, if you take the $20.5 billion, I would think about roughly $15.5 billion of that or so going against the backlog, and then the balance going against near-term maturities that we have through 2026. But the interest rate sensitivity that we have given you includes our exposure on everything, right? So, on the project debt, on the corporate debt issuances, it includes it all.
Steve Fleishman: Okay. That's helpful. And then just one overall question on the renewables environment; maybe you could just talk to, just a little more color on what you're seeing, because there's been a general view that the higher cost of capital environment's really slowing, renewables growth and I just, maybe just more color on what you're seeing, and is there going to be a slowdown that comes next quarter because of the move up, or just more color on the overall environment would be helpful. Thank you.
John Ketchum: Yeah, Steve, I'm going to turn it over to Rebecca. But one thing I would say is the renewable business is increasingly moving more and more towards the scale players, and you can see reasons why. One of them is the ability to have a balance sheet to actually enter into the kind of interest rate hedges that we can enter into. If you can't do that, that really puts you at a significant disadvantage. And then all the other competitive advantages that you're all aware of, where, we buy at scale, we build at scale, we operate at scale. And the last point I want to make is the cost of capital advantage. In today's market environment, having a strong balance sheet with an ultimate parent with an A-minus rating is really, really important, and a super big competitive advantage that we have over the smaller developers that we compete against and that's a big part of our success. But let me turn it over to Rebecca to talk more about what she's seeing in the market.
Rebecca Kujawa: Good morning, Steve. So, we are thrilled with the signings that we posted for this quarter. Obviously, Kirk highlighted that 3.2 gigawatts is a record for us. It's specifically the first time we've been over three gigawatts and it represents, all the things that I think you would want to see, which is strong returns across the portfolio, a great mix of technologies, a good mix of customer type that we signed and entered into these agreements, and also a mix of signings in terms of the date and across those technologies. There were -- our first additions to the backlog in 2027, I actually think it is slightly disproportionate to what we're seeing in terms of our overall backlog and a strong pipeline of projects that we see going into the fourth quarter, which are far more weighted to a little bit in '24 and a lot more in '25 and '26, but we're really excited about it. So, really strong and exciting development pipeline and I'll echo John's comments and it's really what we're seeing on the ground, that after some weariness over the last couple of years, our customers are really, drawn to us for our ability to execute. They understand the pipeline that we're building and the resources that we bring to bear to get projects successfully built and I think that increasingly matters and we're going to continue to address it quarterly. But, all signs are very positive for what I'm seeing today.
Steve Fleishman: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Rebecca Kujawa: Thanks, Steve.#
Operator: Our next question comes from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.
Shahriar Pourreza: Hey, good morning, guys. Just maybe quickly touching on the embedded expectations for NEP, I guess in terms of the Texas pipeline sale, John, are there any more comprehensive updates on the process? And I guess, are you anticipating any delays or challenges in light of the market conditions and kind of the reason why I ask is there's obviously a theory out there or a thesis that you're having a little bit of an issue offloading these assets. So, I'd love to maybe if you can give a little bit more color and anticipation of your full disclosures.
John Ketchum: Yeah, sure. Thank you. Let me start by saying, obviously, as we said in our prepared remarks, our focus is on selling these pipes, growing at 6% and putting NEP in a position to succeed going forward. So, along those lines, we continue to work very diligently on the sales process. We're working with counterparties to get it done. And at the same time, look, this is a little bit more of a challenging macroeconomic environment. These are very valuable pipes and we are looking for a transaction that maximizes value for unit holders and we're going to continue to be disciplined. But in terms of the progress that we're making, things are continuing to advance and move forward and we look forward to having a further update either on the fourth quarter call or sometime before that in terms of where we are.
Shahriar Pourreza: Got it. And then just John, do you anticipate the repowering to sort of fully offset the repowers pipeline sale in '25?
Rebecca Kujawa: Hey, Shahriar, it's Rebecca, I'll take that one. So, we're super excited about repowers as part of the longer-term growth plan within NEP. And with such an extensive pipeline of renewable projects, to pursue these repowers, it'll be a nice complement to continuing to acquire assets. So, it doesn't meet the entire growth plan, but certainly is a nice part of it. As we talked about in May, we have a total of 1.3 gigawatts that we see in the near term. And obviously, this is a first step forward in order to make progress on that. So, attractive CAFD yields, as we noted, there's still some steps to finish. But we're also not done with the opportunities repower other assets in the portfolio.
Shahriar Pourreza: Got it. Perfect. And then just lastly for me, just on the sources and uses of cash, I think we all really appreciate the enhanced disclosures there. I guess, obviously, given the capital-intensive nature of the business, do you anticipate any incremental levers to potentially offset the $3 billion of equity and $3 billion of asset sales if, the capital market conditions become a bit more challenged? I guess any reason to rethink around flexing the payout or the balance sheet metrics? Thanks, guys.
John Ketchum: Yeah. Listen, thank you. Thank you, Shahriar and obviously, we are very, very focused, as always on costs. We're very, very focused on capital productivity and efficiency as well. So, those are two levers we always have and I think our shareholder base is very familiar with the success that we've had in our annual cost reduction processes that we run across the company. But those are certainly point of focus for us and look, when I think about the $3 billion of equity and the $3 billion of asset recycling, if you look historically at what we've been able to do, I'd be pretty disappointed if we can only do $3 billion of asset recycling, not only through NEP, but third parties and as a reminder, over the last three or four years, we've been very successful in selling renewable projects, not only to NEP, but to third parties. Think about the OTPP transaction, the Apollo transaction, the KKR transaction. So, we feel very good about our sources plan that we've laid out and look forward to executing against it.
Shahriar Pourreza: Perfect. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated. Congrats.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Please, go ahead.
David Arcaro: Hi, good morning. Thanks so much for taking my questions. I'm wondering if, you mentioned returns, over 20% returns for storage and wind. I think that's higher than you've indicated in the past and assuming that's driven by higher PPA pricing, was wondering if you're seeing, just given higher PPA prices, any impacts to demand in the renewables market here? And how you think about that level of return in terms of whether it's sustainable, given the competitive dynamics in those end markets? Thanks.
Rebecca Kujawa: Dave, I'll take that. As you know, we've always characterized the backdrop for renewables as a competitive environment. So, I'm very proud of how this team, our team, is executed across an ever-changing environment. And I certainly think it's a strength of our team and most importantly, the competitive advantages that John has highlighted, investment over a long period of time, the ability to work with our supply chain, the ability to work with the folks that we partner with to build the projects and ultimately operate these projects well over time. So, I think that really contributes to our ability to maintain appropriate returns and I also think it reflects what you expect us to do, which is adjust to all of the current costs of both building, financing and operating projects over time and we believe that we are successfully able to achieve that. In terms of demand, obviously, we can't fully predict the future, but I can tell you that the two data points that I think are really top of mind and illustrated from our report today is 3.2 gigawatts is a fantastic sign I think, of demand. And as I highlighted a minute ago to Steve's question, a good underlying foundation of technology, dates, locations, etcetera. So, I'm really pleased and also, in looking at the pipeline for the fourth quarter, obviously, this is a development business. Things can change. But I believe that we're in a good position to continue realizing strong demand, particularly in that 24 timeframe to 26 timeframe. So, based on what we see today, very exciting and I think it's founded on the things that you all know well, which is a backdrop of increasing electrification, increasing demand for generation and capacity value across our sector, and renewables continuing to be the least cost form of generation. So, I would hope you would expect what I would argue is the best position company to execute well against an environment like that.
David Arcaro: Great. Thanks. That's really helpful. And I was also curious on the tax credit transfers market. Could you touch on what you're seeing in terms of demand and interest from counterparties? How deep is that market and what level of pricing that you're realizing when you're transferring these credits as it becomes a more important source of cash flow over the next few years?
John Ketchum: Yeah, Dave, I'll take that question. First of all, I would argue, we have an outstanding tax department. And our tax department, yeah, together with our treasury group started early and we've already reached out to 50 of the top U.S. taxpayers in our building relationships and have had terrific execution against our '23 plan. The demand is extremely robust for tax credit transfers and we're already working on '24 as we speak, having '23 pretty much behind us. And one of the things that really helps NextEra and the tax transfer market is the fact that we have a strong balance sheet. We have an A minus rate from the parent and we're able to underwrite the credit. And being able to underwrite the credit is really, really important because we compete against a lot of really small developers that can't, that if you go to the top 50 taxpayers, they've never heard of these companies. They don't know who they are. They don't really know what they do. They know NextEra and we can provide an indemnity behind the tax credit that we transfer. It sleeves off our vest, so to speak, to be able to do that and we get preferred pricing because of it and so I feel great about where things stand in terms of our tax credit transfer program.
Rebecca Kujawa: And I'd love to add one point on that because I think it's a great complement to our broader business and particularly the C&I customers that we're working with to actually buy some of the renewable energy. Some of the customers that are most active in the market in procuring renewable energy are also the ones that are most interested in buying tax credits from us and I think they really like the value proposition, certainly of the economics, as John highlighted, but really like the value proposition supporting and enabling investment in renewable projects. So we see a really deep market, a lot of interest, and really a lot of cross-selling opportunities across the portfolio.
David Arcaro: Okay, great. Appreciate all the color. Thanks so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, just going back to the last question a bit, how do you think about the composition of the $25 billion to $35 billion of project tax equity and tax credit transferability, how do you think about your existing tax equity commitments, and how do you think about some of the impacts from a regulatory perspective on the tax equity market? Obviously, you're talking about a robust start to the tax credit transferability. How much does it matter? How much does it play into that $25 billion to $35 billion, and ultimately, how much TE is contemplated anyway in that range, if you will?
John Ketchum: Yeah, I'll go ahead and take that, Julien. First of all, when you look at our tax equity project finance split, things can move around. Let's just hypothetically think about it as kind of 50-50. I think that might be a decent starting place to think about and we feel very good about our ability to be able to access tax equity. the regulatory issues, I think, that you pointed out, I think, are going to get resolved. I think there were some unintended consequences around Basel III, and we have had significant discussions with the folks involved. On those issues, the administration certainly thinks this was an unintended consequence, as do, I think, folks at the Fed and the administration, I think, is very focused on trying to get a good resolution around it. But, I don't worry about it too much at the end of the day for us. I think the Basel III thing gets fixed and, worst-case scenario, the banks will find other pockets to be able to issue tax equity. We'll be issue -- we'll receive our allocation off the top of the deck like we always do. And, these relationships that I just spoke about with corporate parties, these 50 folks or so that we've been dealing with, there's no reason they can't step in and provide tax equity financing. And we'll be talking to them about those structures as well and then transferability, which we've already spent some time talking about this morning, can fill any gap. So long story short, we feel terrific about our ability to source tax equity financing going forward.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. So transferability is not technically part of the $25 billion to $35 billion, but obviously it's a fluid conversation, right, if I understand that piece.
John Ketchum: Can you say that again, Julien?
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: The transferability, the credit transferability, technically not included in that $25 billion to $35 billion as it stands, but it's a fluid question of how you finance going forward.
John Ketchum: Yeah. The tax transferability is not in that number. Again, it shows up in cash flow from operations and then the equity content that's created really shows up in that corporate debt issuance line, but look at the corporate-the cash flow from operations in terms of the dollars that we're receiving for tax credit transfers.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yeah. And then just quickly, if I can, on the interest rate question here, thank you again for the additional sensitivities and disclosures here. How do you think about sort of a baseline and the open impact as you roll to kind of 2026? I think it's notable, for instance, you guys reaffirmed through that period with your usual commentary. How do you think about sort of the puts and takes as you roll into that longer dated '26 period, considering the roll off of the hedges here in that, I think, period more specifically, if you will? Is there a way to kind of quantify the interest rate kind of head one?
John Ketchum: Yeah. So a couple of points I'll make. One is you've seen the sensitivity. So zero impact in '23 or '24, $0.03 to $0.05 in '25 and '26. With the five year to 10 year tenors, with the average coupon 375 basis points, we feel very good about the protection that we have there. We've talked about where FPL sits. And then you think about the project financings that we entered into. We use those hedges. Those project financings are basically 20 year amortizing debt that have 20 year hedges that then get rolled into them that have the benefit of those swaps and so when you think about our existing project finance portfolio that we have, there's another $4 billion of interest rate swaps that aren't even in the $20.5 billion that we mentioned to you today that protect and safeguard those as they roll and do. So long story short, between the $20.5 billion that we have against the backlog the fact that our existing portfolio is already locked in and hedged, we feel very good about our interest rate exposure.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Excellent. All right, guys. Thank you very much. I'll pass it there. Have a nice one.
Operator: Our next question comes from Carly Davenport with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Carly Davenport: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Appreciate the incremental disclosure on the funding plan and the asset sales and just to follow up there. Are renewables the only element kind of embedded in that $3 billion in proceeds, or are there any other non-core assets and energy resources that you'd consider monetizing?
John Ketchum: Yeah. So when I think about it, Carly, renewables come top of mind. We've had a history over the last several years of being able to recycle capital through renewables. But remember, too, we're a large company. There are other assets that could potentially be available for capital recycling that are non-core. The FCG transaction that we just recently announced is a good example of that and we'll always look for opportunities. If there are situations where third parties value assets more than we do, then sure, we'll look to be opportunistic, but it's not a core part of the plan.
Carly Davenport: Got it. Okay, great. That's helpful. And then just as you think about the timing cadence of the backlog additions and also the dispersion across the different technologies, I think, Rebecca, you alluded to the fact that the 4Q pipeline is shaping up to be kind of more weighted to the '24 timeframe to '26 timeframe versus this quarter being a little bit longer dated. But can you also just talk about the split across wind, solar, and storage? It seems like there's been step up in solar relative to wind. So just any thoughts on how you see that piece evolving going forward would be helpful.
Rebecca Kujawa: Thanks, Carly. It's a great question. Yes, I definitely support that first part of your comment. And it's consistent with what I had said before that I think this quarter was a little bit anomalous in terms of the waiting to 2027 and the pipeline is very much more weighted for what I see today for '24, '25, and '26, with much of it in the '25 and '26 timeframe, just given the fact that we're ending into '24. In terms of the technology, obviously, we had very strong findings for storage and as Kirk highlighted in the prepared remarks, in terms of the -- maybe not surprise is probably not the right word, but really pleased to see how we're starting to see adoption across a broader set of markets, not just California, but into the Midwest, where our utility customers and obviously some of the C&I are really valuing the ability to incorporate storage for capacity value and affirming and shaping the renewables product. So that's really positive in my mind. On the wind side, I think we're still seeing a little bit of dynamics that shaped up as a result of the tax credits that we originally we and the industry – thought were going to phase down after 2020. So we saw a significant amount of pull forward of demand. And I think that's still affecting the industry a little bit and then, obviously, the PTC being extended for solar significantly improved the economics from a relative standpoint, which has been super positive for demand. We still see a lot of geographies where wind is incredibly attractive and so I feel good about long-term demand for wind and I also feel really good about long-term demand for repowering projects. Obviously, we had a great start to the repowering initiative following the IRA extension with over 700 megawatts we talked about today. Obviously, its share for a year, it's a little bit less than that, but when you look across the entire tens of gigawatts now of renewable projects, there's lots of opportunities to repower as well. So overall, across the board, really excited about the opportunities that we have in front of us.
Carly Davenport: That's great. I appreciate the color.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Weisel with Scotia Bank. Please go ahead.
Andrew Weisel: Hey, good morning, everyone. First, a question. Can you talk a bit about supply chains? I'd be curious your latest thoughts on the availability and status of supply chains, both for solar equipment as well as for grid-level equipment like transformers or switchgears?
John Ketchum: Sure. Yeah, let me take that, Andrew. So, first of all, with supply chain, things are really improved a lot. As Rebecca just mentioned, we have the two issues, right? CERC convention, which has been asked and answered, provided a lot of clarity around what can be done, what can't, and with the Presidential Proclamation. So, in very good shape there. Second was forced labor and making sure that our suppliers are working constructively with Customs and Border Patrol to get their panels cleared for importation into the country. And so, for the most part all of our solar suppliers have been able to do that and so, we are in very good shape there. I think on grid power, I actually the grid-level issues that you just mentioned, we're in very good shape on. We had gone long on grid-level equipment, including transformers and so, we have a significant supply in our inventory and we've also looked forward in a plan for this in terms of trying to make sure that we have equipment available where if our customers or the transmission owner in the places that we're building renewables are short on equipment, are short on grid-level equipment in particular, that we have it in our inventory and are able to offer that up as a solution. And I think one of the big benefits that we have, given our scale and given our leverage and the ability to buy this equipment in very large quantities and really lock up a lot of the manufacturing lines for this equipment, it's a true competitive advantage for a renewable business the way I think about it.
Andrew Weisel: Great. Just to clarify, NIR [ph] is buying this equipment, or FPL? Like, do you keep those separate inventories?
John Ketchum: Both are. Both are because both need it.
Andrew Weisel: Okay, great. And one quick follow-up, if I may, I'm almost apologizing to bring this up. But the Florida State Supreme Court asked the PSU for some details on their approval of the rigged case settlement. Can you just share your expectations around timing of the process and maybe potential outcomes?
Armando Pimentel: Hey, Andrew. It's Armando. You're right that the Supreme Court remanded the settlement agreement back to the Public Service Commission. Our view is that the Public Service Commission is going to take that up soon and will likely be in a position early next year, I would say first quarter of next year, to be able to send that back up to the Supreme Court with the additional details that the Supreme Court is looking forward to receiving. That process would be very similar to the process, both the timeline and the materials that the Public Service Commission went through with the Duke case that was remanded by the Supreme Court back to the Public Service Commission last year, where the Public Service Commission did not reopen the record. We don't expect our record to be reopened and made sure that they put together a conclusion that would be satisfactory in their view with the Supreme Court and send it back to the Supreme Court. So we think we're on the same process as that Duke case was, and we look forward to having the Public Service Commission resubmit that, again, first quarter of next year.
Andrew Weisel: Sounds good. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session and the conference has also now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may all now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-07-25 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners' Q2 2023 Earnings Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kristin Rose, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Kristin Rose : Thank you, Anthony. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our second quarter 2023 combined earnings conference call for NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners.  With me this morning are John Ketchum, Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; Kirk Crews, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; Rebecca Kujawa, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources; and Mark Hickson, Executive Vice President of NextEra Energy. All of whom are also officers of NextEra Energy Partners as well as Armando Pimentel, President and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light Company. Kirk will provide an overview of our results and our executive team will then be available to answer your questions. We will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements, if any of our key assumptions are incorrect, or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release and the comments made during the conference call in the Risk Factors section of the accompanying presentation or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Each of which can be found on the websites www.nexteraenergy.com and www.nexteraenergypartners.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. Today's presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of historical non-GAAP measures to the closest GAAP financial measure. With that, I will turn the call over to Kirk.
Kirk Crews: Thanks Kristin and good morning. NextEra Energy continued its track record of solid execution as reflected in our second quarter results. Adjusted earnings per share grew by approximately 8.6% as we deploy capital for the benefit of FPL customers and leverage our competitive advantages to extend Energy Resources for a noble leadership position.  As our fastest growing state in the U.S., Florida has underlying population growth and an economy that continues to drive clear investment needs. For years, FPL strategy has been simple: Keep bills affordable, the grid reliable, and our customer service exceptional.  With our most recent settlement agreement, FPL has a well-established capital plan with clear visibility through 2025 to deliver on this strategy. This quarter we executed our capital plan with new solar and transmission and distribution infrastructure investments, which led to a greater than 12% increase in regulatory capital employed versus the same quarter last year.  As a result, FPL's earnings per share increased by $0.07 year-over-year. We progress these capital initiatives, while keeping customer bills affordable. We continue to run the business efficiently with multiple opportunities to reduce and manage costs. We deploy smart capital that reduces O&M and fuel costs. We embrace innovation and new technologies and we identify cost savings through our various initiatives.  Customers benefit from these actions, including bills that are among the lowest in Florida and well below the national average. FPL is uniquely positioned to extend its best-class customer value proposition and deliver long-term growth.  Energy Resources, more than two decade track record of originating, developing, constructing, and operating renewables remains as strong as ever. This quarter, on the strength of new investments, Energy Resources grew adjusted earnings by over 14% year-over-year. We continue to see solid renewables and storage demand.  Since our first quarter call, Energy Resources placed over 1,800 megawatts into commercial operations. And it's added approximately 1,665 megawatts of new renewable and storage projects to our backlog, which now stands at roughly 20 gigalons, keeping us on track to achieve our renewable development expectations through 2026.  Given all of our competitive advantages, Energy Resources is uniquely positioned to continue to lead the decolonization of the U.S. economy and be the renewables partner of choice, supporting power, commercial and industrial, and eventually hydrogen customers.  We are pleased with the progress we have made at NextEra Energy so far in 2023. For over 18 months we have operated in a challenging macroeconomic environment with various headwinds. And yet, we have leveraged our competitive advantages to serve customers and deliver on our financial expectations.  Through the first half of the year, both businesses have executed well, delivering adjusted EPS growth of approximately 11%. With FPL comprising more than two-thirds of NextEra Energy's business, our well-established capital plan through 2025 provides investors with long-term growth visibility.  At Energy Resources, we are leveraging our competitive advantages to continue adding new renewables and storage to our backlog, providing clear visibility to our future earnings growth through 2026. Combined, we believe we are well positioned with strong visibility to deliver on our expectations and create long-term value for shareholders.  With that, let's turn to the detailed results beginning with FPL.  For the second quarter of 2023, FPL reported net income of approximately $1.152 billion or $0.57 per share, an increase of $0.07 year-over-year. The principal driver of this performance was FPL's regulatory capital employed growth of approximately 12.1% year-over-year. We continue to expect FPL to realize roughly 9% average annual growth in regulatory capital employed over our current settlement agreements four year term, which runs through 2025.  FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $2.5 billion for the quarter and we now expect FPL's full year 2023 capital investment to be between $8.5 billion and $9.5 billion.  For the 12 months ending June 2023, FPLs reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.8%. During the quarter, we used approximately $78 million of reserve amortization, leaving FPL with a balance of approximately $1 billion.  Our capital projects continue to progress well. As we indicated in our recent 10-year site plan, solar continues to be the lowest cost alternative for our customers. FPL placed into service roughly 225 megawatts of cost effective solar in the quarter, bringing the total year-to-date solar additions to nearly 1,200 megawatts. Over the last two years, FPL has commissioned over 1,600 megawatts of new solar generation. With two and a half years remaining under the current settlement agreement, FPL expects to add roughly 3,100 megawatts of incremental solar through 2025. FPL solar investments allow us to serve strong customer growth, while providing clean, affordable generation and avoiding volatile fuel purchases.  Over the current four year settlement agreement, we continue to expect FPL with a capital investment of between $32 billion to $34 billion. Of that total, we anticipate investing approximately $10 billion in new solar generation and approximately $14 billion to $16 billion in transmission and distribution infrastructure. We remain confident in our total capital plan through 2025, as our cumulative capital investments of approximately $14 billion through June of 2023 are a little ahead of our original timeline.  Our capital investment plan is well-established and by executing on solar deployment and transmission and distribution investments, we are enhancing what we believe is one of the best customer value propositions in the industry.  I'll turn now to the Florida Economy, which continues to demonstrate strong growth. Over the past year, Florida has created roughly 412,000 new private sector jobs, and its unemployment rate continues to decline, currently standing at approximately 2.6%, which is nearly 30% below the U.S. average. Florida consumer sentiment improved roughly 14% compared to the prior year and remains above the U.S. average, while mortgage delinquency rates decline by 55 basis points compared to the prior year. Florida's GDP continues to trend upward, an increase over 9% versus a year ago.  During the quarter, FPL had solid customer growth with the average number of customers increasing by more than 66,000 from the comparable prior year period. FPL's second quarter retail sales increased by approximately 0.3% year-over-year. We estimate that weather had a slightly negative impact on usage per customer of approximately 0.3% on a year-over-year basis.  After taking these factors into account, second quarter retail sales increased roughly 0.6% on a weather normalized basis from the comparable prior year period, driven primarily by continued solid underlying population growth.  Now let's turn to Energy Resources, where second quarter 2023 GAAP earnings, we're approximately $1.462 billion or $0.72 per share. Adjusted earnings for the second quarter we're approximately $781 million dollars or $0.39 per share, which is an increase in adjusted earnings per share of $0.04 year-over-year.  Contributions from new investments increased $0.10 per share year-over-year. Contributions from our existing clean energy portfolio declined $0.06 per share. This decline was mostly due to a large swing in year-over-year wind resource.  This quarter was the lowest second quarter of wind resource on record over the past 30 years, while last year was the highest. The contribution from our customer supply and trading business increased by $0.09 per share, primarily due to higher margins in our customer facing businesses, compared to a relatively weak contribution in the prior year quarter.  All other impacts reduced earnings by $0.09 per share. This decline reflects higher interest cost of $0.06 per share, half of which is driven by new borrowing costs to support new investments and half of which is due to higher interest rates. The remaining impact is due to a combination of other factors, including additional costs to support early stage renewable development investments as we plan for growth in the latter part of the decade.  Energy Resources had a solid quarter of new renewables and storage origination adding approximately 1,665 megawatts to the backlog. With these additions, our backlog now tolls roughly 20 gigawatts, after taking into account over 1,800 megawatts of new projects placed into service since our first quarter call, which keeps us on track to achieve our renewable development expectations through 2026.  Having shared our new expectations just six months ago, we are already within the 2023 to 2024 development expectations range and only need roughly 15 gigawatts over the next three and 1.5 years to achieve the midpoint of the 2023 to 2026 development expectations range.  As part of our backlog addition, this quarter we signed our first contract for a standalone battery storage project co-located with an existing wind facility. The 65 megawatts storage project is expected to serve our customers growing capacity needs in the southwest power pool and be available to monetize pricing arbitrage opportunities in this renewable rich area of the country.  As we have highlighted, we believe there are many more opportunities to monetize the value of our existing 29 gigawatts operating renewables portfolio, including deploying co-located storage like we did here. We are excited to bring facility into commercial operation.  During the quarter we continue to see solid demand for renewables and storage across power and commercial and industrial customers. After a period of underlying commodity price inflation, supply chain disruption and trade policy risk premiums, we are finally seeing signs of stability, which will be helpful in our customer conversations. We believe renewables remain economically attractive to alternative forms of generation, and position ourselves to meet long-term customer demand by expanding our significant pipeline of renewable projects.  Today, we have a pipeline of roughly 250 gigawatts of renewables and storage projects in various stages of development. This includes projects in early stage diligence in our current backlog, and is supported by roughly 145 gigawatts of interconnection queue positions. When you combine our significant competitive advantages with our renewable pipeline, we believe Energy Resources is well positioned for growth and our renewable business for years to come.  We also remain excited about the opportunity to serve hydrogen customers by leveraging our best-in-class renewables development expertise and early stage development position. Throughout the quarter we continue to advocate for smart hydrogen policy that we believe would help the U.S. establish a robust green hydrogen market and drive increased renewables penetration.  We also progress our pipeline of potential green hydrogen opportunities by executing an additional memorandum of understanding to explore developing green hydrogen and related facilities that would integrate into our customers' operations and serve their energy needs.  Hydrogen should be thought of as simply another renewables customer class, and as all our hydrogen related projects could potentially translate into additional new renewables, and with the appropriate regulations, begin to contribute to Energy Resources growth later this decade.  Turning now to our consolidated results. For the second quarter of 2023, GAAP earnings attributed to NextEra Energy were approximately $2.795 billion or $1.38 per share. NextEra Energy recorded approximately $1.777 billion of adjusted earnings and $0.88 cents of adjusted EPS in the second quarter.  Adjusted earnings from the corporate and other segment decreased results by $0.04 per share year-over-year, primarily driven by higher interest costs. We continue to proactively manage interest rates in multiple ways. First, NextEra Energy has $16 billion of various interest rate swaps to help mitigate the impact of future increases in rate.  Second, FPL has features in its settlement agreement to offset higher interest rates such as reserve amortization and the ROE adjustment mechanism, which became effective on September 1, 2022 due to a sustained rise in the 30 year U.S. Treasury yield.  Finally, our focus on continuous improvement through our annual velocity productivity initiative has yielded over $725 million in annual run rate savings ideas. Over the last two years, creating cost savings opportunities to help offset higher interest costs. As always, the current interest rate environment is taken into account in our financial expectations.  Our long-term financial expectations remain unchanged, and we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted EPS expectation ranges. In each year, from 2023 to 2026, while the same time maintaining our strong balance sheet and credit ratings.  From 2021 to 2026, we continue to expect that our average annual growth in operating cash flow will be at or above our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. And we continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at roughly 10% per year, through at least 2024, off a 2022 base. As always, our expectations assume our usual caveats, including normal weather and operating conditions. Now, I'd like to turn to NextEra Energy Partners. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution were $486 million and $200 million respectively, reflecting weaker wind resource. NextEra Energy Partners remains well positioned to deliver on its 2023 run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution.  Yesterday, NextEra Energy Partners Board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.854 per share per common unit or $3.42 per common unit on an annualized basis, up approximately 12% from a year earlier. Inclusive of this quarter, NextEra Energy Partners has grown its LP distribution per unit over 355% since the IPO.  Since our last earnings call, NextEra Energy Partners completed its previously announced acquisition of approximately 690 megawatts of wind and solar assets. With this acquisition, NextEra Energy Partners renewable portfolio is over 10,000 megawatts. Further strengthening its position as the world's seventh largest producer of electricity from the wind and sun. The partnership is well-positioned to execute on its simplification plan to become a 100% renewables focus company.  Regarding this simplification plan, in May we launched the sales process for the Texas Natural Gas Pipeline portfolio and are pleased with our progress is we remain on track to sell the assets by later this year. NextEra Energy Partners expects to use the proceeds from the planned Texas Pipeline portfolio sales together with a mean natural gas pipeline sale in 2025 to eliminate the equity buyouts on the three near-term convertible equity portfolio financing. STX Midstream and EP Renewables 2, and 2019 NEP Pipelines. Upon successful execution of the Texas pipeline portfolio sell, the partnership does not expect to require equity through 2024, other than opportunistic equity issuances under our at the market equity program to fund future growth beyond 2024.  Now to the detailed results. NextEra Energy Partners delivered second quarter adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution of $486 million and $200 million respectively, reflecting the adverse impacts of weaker wind resource. The adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution contribution from existing projects declined by approximately $99 million and $39 million respectively, primarily driven by a large swing in year-over-year wind resource. This quarter was the lowest-second quarter of wind resource on record over the past 30 years, while last year was the highest.  New projects contributed approximately $49 million of adjusted EBITDA and $5 million of cash available for distribution. Second quarter results for adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution were positively impacted by the Incentive Distribution Rights Fee Suspension and provided approximately $38 million of benefit this quarter, partially offsetting the impact of poor wind resource performance.  As we previously shared, we expect strong double-digit growth in the second half of the year and adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution to support NextEra Energy Partners, LP distribution per unit growth expectations range for the full year 2023. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide.  From a base of our fourth quarter 2022 distribution per common unit and an annualized rate of $3.25, we continue to see 12% to 15% growth per year and LP distributions per unit as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2026. However, as we previously shared with you, we expect to grow at or near the bottom end of that range. For 2023, we expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2023 distribution that is payable in February of 2024 to be in a range of $3.64 to $3.74 per common unit.  NextEra Energy Partners continue to expect run rate contributions for adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution and its forecasted portfolio at December 31, 2023 to be in the ranges of $2.2 billion to $2.42 billion and $770 million to $860 million respectively. As a reminder, year-end 2023 run rate projections reflect calendar year 2024 contributions from the forecasted portfolio at year-end 2023. As always, our expectations subject to our usual caveats, including normal weather and operating conditions.  In summary, we believe that NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners are well-positioned to continue delivering long-term value for shareholders and unit holders. At NextEra Energy, the plan is simple: Our two businesses are deploying capital and renewables and transmission for the benefit of customers providing visible growth opportunities for shareholders. At FPL, we're executing on our well-established capital investment plan, which allows us to extend our customer value proposition.  Florida’s strong population growth drives smart capital investment and running the business efficiently allows us to manage costs for the benefit of both customers and shareholders. FPL comprises more than two-thirds of NextEra Energy's business and provides a significant amount of visibility into capital deployment and earnings growth.  At Energy Resources, we're leveraging our more than 20 years of experience, competitive advantages to grow our market share and add to our now roughly 20 gigawatts backlog, providing terrific growth visibility through 2026. We believe these competitive advantages will enable Energy Resources to serve power, commercial and industrial, and eventually hydrogen customers.  With an opportunity set of $20 billion of capital investment, requiring more than 15 gigawatts of new renewables, Energy Resources is well-positioned to be green hydrogen partner of choice, potentially creating new opportunities toward the end of the decade.  At NextEra Energy Partners we are executing on our plans to sell our natural gas pipelines and simplify the business. We continue to add to our renewables and storage portfolio, which now stands at over 10,000 megawatts. With the sale of the Texas Natural Gas Pipeline portfolio expected to be completed by the end of the year, NextEra Energy Partners remains on track to transition to a 100% pure play renewables company, while continuing to deliver LP distribution per unit growth for unit holders.  With that, we're happy to answer your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Res. You may now go ahead. 
Steve Fleishman : Yeah, hey good morning, thanks. Hope you're all well. So a couple – first, just on the quarter. The customer supply trading business continues to do well and you mentioned higher margins. I think Constellation has been talking about that too. Could you just talk more about what you think is driving that in the supply business? 
John Ketchum : Yeah, sure Steve. This is John Ketchum and a good morning to you as well. In the customer supply and trading business, we’re just seeing a lot less competition, number one. And number two, remember, a lot of – most of the business activity that we do in that group is customer facing business. Our full requirements business for example, where we're working with municipalities and cooperatives to help provide their power needs and arrange the capacity and ancillaries and other regulatory requirements that need to manage their business, particularly up in the North East.  That business, because it's had a lot less competition, it has benefited from significant margins. And please, you know one of the points I want to make is, these arrangements that we enter into in the full requirements business are typically two or three years and we're immediately going at them back to back, hedging those positions. So feel great about the risk profile, and again, terrific margins that really match up well with their skill sets, our competitive advantages and our core operations. So that's really the main driver.  And I also want to remind folks that when you think about our customer and supply business we run it at a very, very low bar. For example, the last quarter we ran that business roughly at a 2% bar. So it's very, very small business, risk exposure overall for PMI. 
Steve Fleishman : Okay, next question just on… [Cross Talk]
John Ketchum : Steve, one other point I want to make too on the customer supply business is that that business, historically you can go back 10 years and the customer supply and trading business, including this year has never contributed more than 10% of NextEra Energies net income and I think that's important to keep in mind as well. We run a – we have a lot of complementary businesses. Obviously, FPL has done well. We have other complementary businesses that Energy Resources on top of our renewable business. But that business has always stayed under 10% and that's one of the commitments that we make to the rating agencies, and that's true this year as well. 
Steve Fleishman : Okay, great. Just maybe just the latest year hearing on the hydrogen, green hydrogen rules from Treasury, both kind of timing in any color of where they are on some of the key issues like matching and additionality. Thanks. 
John Ketchum: Yeah, we have been very vocal around the hydrogen regulations that need to come together and there's been a debate for those that are familiar with it, between whether we have hourly matching or annual matching. And for us it's very simple, as part of a hydrogen project you buy an expensive asset called an electrolyzer, which everyone is familiar with. And if you have hourly matching, the net capacity factor, the number of hours a day that you use that electrolyzer are probably less than half the day in most parts of the country.  If you have an annual construct, we're able to use that electrolyzer around the clock and so it's really easy math. I mean, when you have an expensive capital asset and you can use it around the clock, the price of green hydrogen is going to be a lot lower if you can only use it less than half a time.  And so the industry has come forward with a very constructive proposal, which would have the hourly matching construct not kick in until 2028. You’d have annual until that time period and we also have supported the fact that you have to have additionality if you're going to go qualify for annuals.  So if you're qualifying for annual in the hours that the wind is not blowing or the sun is not shining the power, the electrolyzer behind the meter and you are buying off the grid. Well, you're buying from an additional renewable asset that has been constructed and developed to provide electrons to that newly built hydrogen facility. So from an NGO perspective, you're getting additional decarbonization benefits on the grid.  So we think we've been very constructive in what we have come forward with. We think it's really important, because we want to send the right price signal to OEMs to ramp up production on electrolyzers, because electrolyzers being produced at scale is going to be critically important to declines in green hydrogen prices over time. And so that's where we are in terms of your question around timing. We expect Treasury to probably come out with regulations now. We're hoping for August, but it's starting to sound more like September or October.  But again, we have built a significant hydrogen pipeline, parts of it work on either construct and that pipeline is well over $20 billion and we have the land team out and we've had them out, very aggressively lining up land positions for our hydrogen portfolio that the nice thing about that and which Kirk said it in the remarks, that pipeline is now about 250 gigawatts when you include early due diligence sites.  Nobody in our industry has a pipeline like that, nobody, and what's terrific about it is it can be used for dual purpose, because hydrogen customers are just a third customer class to sell renewables to. So if the site doesn't work for hydrogen, it will work for our power or C&I customers.  So I feel like we're really well positioned and hydrogen is one of those things that can really provide a nice boom to the development expectations that we've already laid out for you. So we're eager to see what the final regulations say. But I also want to remind folks that hydrogen has a long development cycle, so the contribution that we'll see from hydrogen investments you would expect over the latter part of the decade.
Steve Fleishman : Okay, last question, just on the Texas sale. So I think you said you'd still expect to get it done by year end. When would that, when would you need or expect to or need to kind of announce transaction to make the year-end and just how should we think about the recent data points we've seen like the TransCanada, the TC sell down, Columbia sell down, and co-point. I know they're different assets, but just in the context of views on valuation of energy. Thank you. 
John Ketchum: Yeah, thank you Steve. So let me take those in order. So in terms of timing, we would hope to be in a position, in the end of the third quarter or early fourth quarter in order to support that end of the year sales timeline that we have earmarked.  In terms of valuation, we view these assets as unique. Again as a reminder, the Texas pipelines provide 25% of the natural gas supply to Mexico through contracts with Pemex, and the other pipeline assets that support the Texas pipeline are fully integrated with that pipe, and they provide gas to Mexico, through (inaudible), which is a very liquid trading point. And if you look around that area, these are very, very strategic for a number of players.  So again, as you all know, it's hard to compare one pipe comp to another, but again, we remain pleased with the progress that we continue to make on the sales transaction. 
Steve Fleishman : Okay, great. Thank you. 
John Ketchum: Thank you, Steve. 
John Ketchum: Oh! And Steve. I think I said 2% on the bar, I meant $2 million on the bar for PMI, just correct that. Thank you. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. You may not go ahead. 
Shahriar Pourreza : Hey! Good morning, guys. 
John Ketchum: Good morning, Shah. 
Shahriar Pourreza : Good morning. Let me just, as we kind of look at the latest renewable portfolio transactions, the valuations have come in fairly noticeably. Do you guys see any opportunities to kind of leverage NextEra platform in either picking up existing assets or developer books, especially sort of given what seems to still be a type financing and supply chain position for some of your competitors, while you're seeing improvements with yours, right? 
Kirk Crews: Yeah, we are. I mean, first of all let me just comment on the valuations that you see. I mean, I think that – look, I'm not going to be critical on some of the assets that have come to sale. But, if you read through the lines and into the details of the structures of those transactions, those are not characterized as high quality renewable assets.  When you look back at what we have developed over the last 20 years and what we continue to develop are very high quality renewable assets. Most of them are bus bar. They are with high credit counterparty off-takers. They are well situated in areas that benefit from our data analytics around transmission congestion, wind resource, solar resource. Because we have 20 years of experience, I like to believe and look, we are perfect, but we don't make some of the same mistakes that you see some of the other developers make.  And so I feel like we're much better positioned. Our portfolio is in much better position than some of the other markers that you have seen. So I'd be very, very careful on how you assess portfolio to portfolio, because they are very, very different.  The second thing I would say is, we look at all third-party M&A opportunities that come available and we feel like we do have all the competitive advantages, you know some of what you mentioned. We buy cheap, we build cheap, we operate cheap, we have a cost-capable advantage. We have a terrific team that really understands how to optimize the value of existing assets, that's the key piece.  Repowering assets is something we've always had a very strong track record at. It’s something that the rest of the industry has struggled with and that gives us a real leg up in terms of being able to see values that others don't. And then as Kirk mentioned on the call today, we have a benefit and an organic asset that nobody else has, which is the largest fleet in North America that we operate.  And so we have the ability not only to repower those existing assets, but to find ways to pair them up with storage and take advantage of the stand-alone storage ITC. As you all know, storage used to only be a unique opportunity to pair with solar. The rules of change with the stand-alone storage ITC under IRA. So now we can pair it with wind, we can build a stand-alone. We're making a lot of progress in that area.  We announced one project today where we are starting to see an opportunity, particularly in MISO and SPP, in ERCOT, where capacity values and reliability are being priced higher than what we've seen them in the past, given some of the shortfalls that they have in those markets and that just happens to coincide with where most of our wind is.  And given the massive existing fleet that we have, which very importantly includes an existing interconnection agreement, our ability to go and pair those assets up with solar or to repower them is unique in this industry given the two-decade head start that we have. And so that's a value that we try to bring to M&A opportunities as well when we exercise our other competitive advantages, including our cost-to-capable advantage. 
Shahriar Pourreza : Got it. Perfect. And John, it's been a little bit quiet and it hasn't really been a focus for a lot of investors, but is there any sort of updates around the FTC case as of today? Any change in stances indicated by the disclosures? Any opportunities to settle? Thanks. 
John Ketchum : Yeah, thank you Shah for the question. No new developments and there's really no new news there. Again, we would expect just based on historical precedent with the FTC that we would hear back where they have a reasonable belief that they should investigate, probably sometime in the first quarter of 2024. 
Shahriar Pourreza : Perfect. Thank you, guys. I appreciate it. Thanks for the time. Fantastic. 
John Ketchum: Thank you, Shah. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. You may now go ahead.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith : Hey! Good morning John. Good morning Kirk. Thank you guys very much. So I wanted to come back to the decade into the cadence to the backlog conditions. Just looking at, ‘23, ‘24 versus ‘25, ‘26 there. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing out there in terms of the ability to execute in kind of the nearer term sense to execute against that first bucket versus the latter here?  And especially, give us a little bit of an update on IRS clarity and what that means for the willingness to commit to the close-on contracts here, especially maybe now that you have that in hand on transferability, etcetera. How do you think about maybe biasing towards the later years there, just given where we stand already? 
John Ketchum: Yeah, good question, Julien. So let me just start with – take that in chunks, because everyone knows our development expectations are ‘23 to ‘26. So let's just start with the first two years and then we'll talk about the second two years.  So for ‘23 through ‘24, we are in great shape. We are already within the range as we had expected to be. And then on ‘25 and ‘26, you know if you go back to the beginning of ‘22, and you add up where we are today, we've already added 12 gigawatts just in the last six quarters. That puts us in great shape against ‘25 and ‘26, because now we have 15 gigawatts to get to the midpoint and if you kind of work backwards from ‘26, that's 3.5 years to get 15 gigawatts.  So we feel like we are really in great position and on track on that build. And I think there's some real tailwinds that we're going to start to see come forward and I want to explain some dynamics, you know just around what we've seen in the renewable industry, which was part of your question Julien.  Let's just go back to ‘22. I mean, in ‘22 we saw a lot of supply chain issues that started to surface. And then we saw here a flip, we saw circumvention and that cost them delays. It also cost us outages supply, because some developers are scrambling for panels that they thought they could get into the country, which I think for a short period of time drove prices up.  The great thing is, all those 22 projects that got delayed in to ‘23 are now starting to go into commercial operation. That's a really good news, good news for customers, because those customers that were digesting that ‘22 build and waiting for those projects to go COD in to ‘23 are now coming back to the market. And so we're seeing really strong demand from those folks as we start to look forward.  The other benefit of that is as you see you flip up, as you start to get works work through. We're not seeing that you flip awhole back that we used to see, so we're making a lot of progress on that front. When you take that into account with the clarity that we're now seeing around circumvention, we finally have this bright line rule with the six-part test and as long as you meet four of the six, and you're importing from Southeast Asia, you're okay. And so what we've seen is a relaxation in pricing as a result of that. So now the risk premium that was being charged last year by the import market is starting to come down.  The other terrific phenomenon that we're seeing around solar pricing is that Southeast Asia still sets the price for panels in the U.S., but as that risk price premium is starting to come down and Southeast Asia really wants a big part of the U.S. market. Why do they want a big part of the U.S. market? They sell panels for $0.20 everywhere else, right? They've been selling panels for $0.40 roughly in the U.S. So they have a lot of room to move.  And so as that risk premium comes down around, you flip in and circumvention is forcing prices down in the U.S. At the same time you're seeing a lot more U.S. supply come online through new module facilities are getting announced, also through cell facilities that will come along with it. And so the bottom line is when you look at the solar picture, it's favorable from an equipped price standpoint, because I think you're starting to see a lot of capacity come online that is going to force prices down over time, particularly as you see the U.S. market evolve.  And it's no secret with some of the economic data coming out of China that some of those Southeast Asian markets are under pressure with capacity, excess capacity positions, and so they've got batteries and panels they need to find things to do with. Battery prices are coming down as well. We’re finally seeing a relaxation in battery prices. Really struggling to see – really struggling in the EV market in China, which has created very much in excess capacity around batteries and so we’re finally starting to see some relaxation there. I think there's been more of a movement around traditional lithium ion and some of the rare mineral exposure you see there, sodium and other battery forms, and so very encouraged about the landscape there.  And then on the wind OEM side, the wind folks are really one of the only ones that can reap the full benefit of domestic content and the full manufacturer incentive. So we feel really good about where wind sits as well.  So I think as you start to look forward and we started to move through these supply chain issues you saw in ‘22 of these projects coming online in ‘23 come combined with excess capacity globally around the supply chain, we feel great there. And let me talk about transferability for a second. There's been a lot of discussion and I've heard a lot of questions about folks saying, well, how is transferability going to be accounted for? And is it going to be part of the FFO and in the FFO-to-debt metric.  We feel very good and we've told investors for a long time that we feel very good that it's in accordance with GAAP, it flows through the tax line for tax credits that get transferred, to be included and so we feel good about where that is heading and that will end up in a good place there on that FFO-to-debt question that has surfaced around transferability.  So when you put all those pieces together, as we've worked through some of these headwinds that we've had, we feel very good about where things are heading and let's just face it, we're just getting started. Renewables are here to stay, they're not going anywhere. And so while we might – you know the development process isn’t always going to be a straight line, we're in terrific shape and feel very optimistic about the future.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith : Right. Thank you and actually John, to that point though, a lot of the dynamics you just talked about are very like real time if you will versus kind of trailing into the quarter itself. How do you feel about just that contracting acceleration here in the back half? I mean a lot of the points you made would really argue that you could see an uptick versus kind of something that was more on trend in the last quarter.
John Ketchum: Yeah, a lot of it is going to depend on, as I said before, these ‘22 projects continuing to come online in 2023 and those customers that had a little bit of fatigue so to speak. We are around those delays coming back to market which we're starting to see and so that will be the wild card. But we feel good about how the rest of the year continues to shape up.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith : Got it. Will stay tuned on that front. All right, excellent. Thank you sir. 
John Ketchum: And Julien, one of the things to add to that is, it’s hydrogen. We get the right rules there and again I can't stress it enough. I mean we've always only had two customer classes for renewable. It's been power sector, it's been the C&I sector. Now with the right rules, we have the potential to add a third customer class, which is the renewables for hydrogen customers and that's exciting as well.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith : Yes, so stayed tuned. Maybe a quarter or two after you get those rules that you’ll really see that flow through in that third customer class. 
John Ketchum: Yes, I think that's right. And then remember, those projects that have longer lead time development cycles. So in terms of the contribution that investors should expect, it's going to come in the latter part of the decade.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith : Excellent! Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. You may now go ahead.
David Arcaro: Hey! Good morning. Thanks so much for taking my question. Maybe shifting a little bit to NEP. I was wondering, you know I know you don't – in terms of the financing outlook, you don't need equity for some time here. But I was wondering if you could just give any latest thoughts on alternative financing approaches to hit longer term growth projections at NEP. 
John Ketchum: Yes, I mean for NEP, first of all the focus is on the simplification strategy which we shared with the market back in May and we have said that our expectation as a result of that is, we don't – you know assuming a successful execution on that sale, that we don't expect to have equity requirements in 2024, other than opportunistic equity issuances under our ATM to help finance growth beyond 2024.  But if you look, and you can see in the slides here, that we have a lot of flexibility under our current metrics with the agencies, in terms of the ability to add additional, what I would call traditional debt based capital market financing, mechanisms to accommodate the growth going forward.  And we are very busy looking at the back end, three sublets that we have and some ideas around how we are going to address those as well. Because when we move on from the simplification transaction, that's going to be the next point of focus. We are not – but we're not waiting. We are continuing to look at that.  And look, there continues to be a strong bid for an interest in renewable interest, in renewable assets long term. Particularly when you think about the opportunity to do that with the world leader in renewable development, with the competitive advantages that we have, the 20 gigawatt backline log. The growth visibility that NEP has going forward, all very promising. And so we could continue to engage in those discussions as well as we think about the future.
David Arcaro: Got it, got it, thanks for that color. And then also just had a question related to the transmission constraints that we've seen in the industry. But you made the comment about a very large interconnection position, 145 gigawatts. I was just wondering if you could speak to the transmission queue challenges and do you think that could potentially be a constraint on growth for the industry or at any point or how much visibility do you have into hitting long term growth targets with that massive queue that you've gotten in place.
John Ketchum: Yes, so let me take that in two pieces. I mean one is the 145 gigawatts that you reference and David around the 250 gigawatt pipeline that we have, already have, with the 145 interconnection position secured. I would challenge you to find anybody in the industry that has even close to that that number of projects with interconnection capacity.  And don't forget, given the demand we're seeing in the market, if you have a site ready to go with interconnection capacity, that's the hard part. Finding the customer right now is not the hard part. And so that's why we have such a focus on making sure that our early stage development program is right on track and I feel just terrific about where we stand there today. Let me take the second piece, so that you have which is just about transmission in general. We are not waiting. We are taking the transmission and interconnect issues in our own hands and we are doing that through NextEra Energy transmission. We are laser focused on competitive transmission build out around where our renewable assets are going and where they are going to be built.  We announced a project last quarter, another $400 million opportunity in Cal ISO. I'm not going to talk about them today, but we have a number of various other transmission projects, on the board right now that we are evaluating. That business is going terrific and again, the bottom line message for investors is we're not waiting. We're taking the game, we're taking that into our own hands, that’s why we bought GridLiance. That's why we continue to make investments in that space and we intend to solve those problems ourselves as we go along.
David Arcaro:  Excellent! That's helpful. Thanks so much for all the color. 
John Ketchum: Thanks David.
Operator: Our next question will come from Carly Davenport with Goldman Sachs. You may now go ahead.
Carly Davenport: Hi! Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just wanted to go back to the supply chain and thanks for the commentary there in the earlier question. But just in terms of rate of change from a supply chain perspective relative to recent quarters, are you seeing any divergence between trends and wind projects versus solar projects?
John Ketchum: Yes, I mean in terms of wind projects, let me just make a couple of comments there. I mean we do almost all of our businesses with GE. We have done a little bit with Siemens and I know there's been some press on Siemens recently. We don't have any of the Siemen’s Gamesa turbines in our fleet. I just want to make that very clear. As we think about supply chain around wind versus solar, remember that wind turbines are made almost exclusively in the U.S. and so they'll be direct beneficiaries of the manufacturing incentives and we hope domestic content. They have a couple of paperwork things they have to work out with Treasury, which you know hopefully we'll get there on in terms of what kind of information they have to share with their ultimately customers and giving away the secrets to us on margins and all those things, but they continue to work through those issues. But wind just doesn't have the same exposure in the issues that we've had the deal with solar. Around you flip, around circumvention. But again as I said earlier, those issues around solar which really plague the industry back in ‘22 have been things that we've been working through in ‘23 and now we're starting to see a lot more capacity show up, not only in the U.S., but in other markets as well, and so we are capitalizing on all those opportunities and leverage in our buying power as you would expect us to do. 
Carly Davenport: Great. That's helpful. And then the follow-up is just a quick one on kind of the cost environment. It seems like it's starting to improve a bit, but still challenging for many. Can you just talk about how your managing costs in this environment and kind of what levers exist that are available to pull if needed to continue to execute at a high level from an earnings perspective. 
John Ketchum: Yes, thanks Carly. So, we spoke on our last call about – and I know you're from there with this. We run a cost savings initiative every year at the company. This year we called it Velocity that we ran under the same name last year and we challenge every one of our business units. It’s a bottoms-up process to come with cost savings ideas for how we run our company. And we've had amazing success through that program over the last 10 years, and in the last two years in fact, if you look at it, we've been able to identify over $700 million of cost savings initiatives, both at FPL and Energy Resources. So we're constantly looking for ways to continue to take cost out of the business; whether it's OEM, whether it's G&A.  And how do we leverage technology? Technology is a big piece of it as well. We recently launched a massive generative AI program that we think also leveraging all the skills that we have around technology, that we've been able to build over the last 10 to 15 years to really leverage AI in a way we never have in terms of how we run the business as well. And so all those things I think are going to contribute to cost declines over time for the business, but we're a laser focused on cost.  And then the development business, when you're selling a commodity, electricity to gain inches, you got to be better than the next developer in line in terms of buying equipment cheaper, building it cheaper, operating cheaper, financing it cheaper. And we have with the A minus balance sheet, you know terrific cost to capital advantage. When we put all those things together, we feel great about our competitive position, our market share and how we continue to progress our renewable development program. 
Carly Davenport: Great! Thanks for that color.
Operator: Our next question – pardon me. This concludes our question-and-answer session. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-04-25 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners' First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note that, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kristen Rose [ph] , Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
Unidentified Company Representative: Thank you, Vishnavi.

Kirk will provide an overview of our results and our executive team will then be available to answer your questions. We will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements, if any of our key assumptions are incorrect, or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call in the Risk Factors section of the accompanying presentation or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Each of which can be found on our websites www.nexteraenergy.com and www.nexteraenergypartners.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. Today's presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of historical non-GAAP measures to the closest GAAP financial measure. With that I will turn the call over to Kirk. 
Kirk Crews: Thank you, Kristen, and good morning everyone. NextEra Energy is off to a strong start in 2023. Adjusted earnings per share increased by approximately 13.5% year-over-year building on the success of last year's strong execution and financial performance. During the quarter, we were honored that NextEra Energy was again ranked number one in our sector on Fortune's list of the world's most admired companies for the 16th time in 17 years. We are extremely proud of the team and culture we have built that has enabled us to deliver low-cost clean and reliable power to our customers, while also providing long-term value to our shareholders. FPL is the largest electric utility in the US and Florida is now officially the fastest-growing state in America. At FPL, our focus remains the same deploying smart capital to deliver on what we believe is one of the best customer value propositions in our industry. Key to that strategy is keeping customer bills affordable. And this quarter, we proposed using projected 2023 fuel savings to reduce unbilled fuel costs from 2022 to provide bill relief to customers. To further manage fuel price volatility, we are also helping customers by adding more solar to the FPL grid. This quarter, we placed into service approximately 970 megawatts of new low-cost solar. Putting FPL's owned and operated solar portfolio at nearly 4,600 megawatts, which is the largest solar portfolio of any utility in the country. We believe solar is now the lowest cost generation option for Florida customers, but represents only about 5% of FPL's delivered energy. In order to extend the benefits of low-cost solar to customers, FPL's recently filed 10-year site plan, now includes nearly 20,000 megawatts of new solar. Energy Resources, the world's leader in renewables and a leader in battery storage, remains laser-focused on executing a strategy of decarbonizing the power sector and helping commercial and industrial customers outside the power sector, reduce their energy cost and decarbonize their operations by moving to low-cost renewables and other clean energy solutions. This quarter, Energy Resources added approximately 2,020 megawatts of new renewables and storage projects to its backlog. Energy Resources also closed on its previously announced acquisition of a large portfolio of operating landfill gas-to-electric facilities, providing the foundation for our growing RNG business. We are also excited to announce a new memorandum of understanding with CF Industries to create green hydrogen, establishing what we expect will be a long-term relationship with the world's largest ammonium producer. And finally, Energy Resources continues to build what we believe is the nation's leading competitive transmission business to help support growth in renewables. We are pleased to announce that the California ISO recently recommended for approval approximately $400 million in new transmission and substation upgrades for NextEra Energy Transmission. We believe, NextEra Energy continues to be anchored by two great businesses that leverage each other's expertise to make them even better. We do not believe anyone in our industry has our set of skills, scale and breadth of opportunities. We believe NextEra Energy is able to buy, build operate and finance cheaper with one of the strongest balance sheets in our sector. We also believe our best-in-class development skills and unparalleled data set enable us to provide innovative technology and low-cost clean energy solutions for the benefit of our customers. The opportunities and products demanded by the market are becoming more complex, requiring significant scale and a combination of skills that we believe few of our competitors can offer, further enhancing our competitive advantages and creating even more growth opportunities for our business going forward. We have a culture rooted and continuous improvement, always striving to be better. Along those lines, we just completed our annual employee-led productivity initiative, which we now call Velocity. For over 11 years, our employees have generated approximately $2.6 billion in annual run rate savings ideas, as part of this process. In 2023 alone, our team generated ideas expected to produce roughly $325 million in annual run rate savings, which when combined with last year's results of over $400 million is the most productive two-year period in this program's history and that's after doing it for over a decade. We believe we have the best team in the industry, and these results are indicative of the breadth and depth of capabilities and the commitment to excellence that our team brings to our business every day and executing on behalf of our customers and shareholders. With that let's turn to the detailed results beginning with FPL. For the first quarter of 2023, FPL reported net income of $1.07 billion, or $0.53 per share an increase of $0.09 year-over-year. Regulatory capital employed growth of approximately 11.2% was a significant driver of FPL's EPS growth versus the prior year comparable quarter. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $2.3 billion for the quarter. We expect our full year 2023 capital investments at FPL to be between $8.0 billion and $9.0 billion, as we continue to invest capital smartly for the continued benefit of our customers. FPL's reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.8% for the 12 months ending March 2023. During the quarter, we utilized $373 million of reserve amortization to achieve our targeted regulatory ROE leaving FPL with a balance of $1.07 billion. As we've previously discussed, FPL historically utilizes more reserve amortization in the first half of the year, and we expect this trend to continue this year. Earlier this year, the Florida Public Service Commission approved FPL's proposed plan to recover approximately $2.1 billion of incremental fuel costs from 2022 partially offset by projected 2023 fuel savings of approximately $1.4 billion. Amid high natural gas prices in 2022, FPL's decades-long modernization of its generation fleet has saved customers more than $2 billion in fuel costs in 2022 alone. The commission also recently approved recovery of approximately $1.3 billion of hurricane costs from 2022 over a 12-month period. Taking all approved adjustments together, we anticipate that FPL's typical 1,000 kilowatt hour residential customer bills will remain well below the projected national average and among the lowest of all Florida utilities. Turning to our development planning and efforts. FPL recently filed its annual 10-year site plan that presents our generation resource plan for the next decade. The 2023 plan includes roughly 20,000 megawatts of new low-cost solar capacity across our service territory over the next 10 years, which would result in nearly 35% of FPL's forecasted energy delivery in 2032 coming from cost-effective solar generation up significantly from roughly 5% in 2022. Given the increasing customer benefits of low-cost renewables FPL's post-2025 solar capacity additions and this year's plan are more than double last year's approved plan and also includes 2 gigawatts of battery storage over the next decade. We believe the expansion of cost-effective solar and storage will provide a valuable hedge for our customers against volatile natural gas prices and meet the electricity demand of FPL's growing customer base with a low-cost generation source. Finally, construction of our green hydrogen pilot at our Okeechobee Clean Energy Center is on track and projected to go into service later this year. Turning now to the Florida economy. Florida became the fastest-growing state in the nation in 2022 and its population continues to increase with over 1,000 people moving to Florida every day. Over the last five years, Florida's GDP has grown at a roughly 7% compound annual growth rate and is now approximately $1.4 trillion which is up approximately 8% versus a year ago. Based on GDP, if Florida was a country, it would have the 14th largest economy in the world. FPL's first quarter retail sales increased 0.4% from the prior year comparable period driven by continued solid underlying population growth with FPL's average number of customers increasing by approximately 65,000, even after removing roughly 15,000 inactive customers due to Hurricane Ian. For the first quarter, we estimate that the positive impact of warmer weather was more than offset by a decline in underlying usage for our customers. As we have often pointed out, underlying usage can be somewhat volatile on a quarterly basis, particularly during periods when temperatures deviate significantly from normal, as we experienced this winter with average temperatures greater than four degrees above normal. Our long-term expectations of underlying usage growth continues to average between zero and approximately negative 0.5% per year. Energy Resources report first quarter 2023 GAAP earnings of approximately $1.440 billion or $0.72 per share. Adjusted earnings for the first quarter were $732 million or $0.36 per share up $0.04 versus the prior year comparable period. Contributions from new investments increased $0.07 per share year-over-year. Contributions from our existing Clean Energy portfolio were lower by $0.03 per share primarily due to less favorable wind and solar resource compared to the prior year. The contribution from our customer supply and trading business increased by $0.06 per share primarily due to higher margin in our customer-facing business and compared to a relatively weaker contribution in the prior year comparable quarter. Gas infrastructure and all other impacts reduced earnings by $0.01 and $0.05 per share respectively versus 2022. Energy Resources had another strong quarter of origination capitalizing on strong global demand environment. Since the last call, we added approximately 2020 megawatts of new renewables and storage projects to our backlog including roughly 1370 megawatts of solar, 450 megawatts of storage and 200 megawatts of wind. With these additions, our renewables and storage backlog now stands at over 20.4 gigawatts net of projects placed in service and provides strong visibility into our future growth. With more than 1.5 years remaining before the end of 2024, we are now within the 2023 to 2024 development expectations range. Given the volatility in gas and power prices over the last 1.5 years, we continue to see economics driving long-term decision-making and renewables remain the clear low-cost option for many customers. On the supply -- solar supply chain front, we continue to take constructive steps to mitigate potential future disruption. Nearly every one of our suppliers has repositioned their supply chains to manufacture solar panels in Southeast Asia using wafers and cells produced outside of China, and all our suppliers are expected to meet the criteria established in the Commerce Department's preliminary determination in the 2022 circumvention case by the end of 2023. Additionally, we are focused on further diversifying our supply chain and are currently advancing discussions to support the domestic production of solar panels. Finally, we are encouraged by the improvement in the flow of panels into the US as suppliers continue to provide the requested traceability documentation to US Customs and Border Protection. Also, during the quarter, we closed on the previously announced transaction to acquire a large portfolio of operating landfill gas-to-electric facilities that I mentioned earlier. The approximately $1.1 billion transaction represents an attractive opportunity for energy resources to realize double-digit returns on this investment, while expanding its portfolio of renewable natural gas assets and growing its in-house capabilities and rapidly expanding renewable fuel market. Turning to green hydrogen, we are excited about the role it is expected to play as a solution to help our customers cost effectively lower emissions. As the world leader in renewables and a leader in battery storage, we believe we are the logical partner for green hydrogen with significant interconnection and land inventory positions and deep market expertise to help our potential partners optimize some of the best green hydrogen sites around the country. As a result, with the right regulation, we see hydrogen quickly becoming a significant technology for our customers and a new growth driver for energy resources given the number and size of the opportunities we are evaluating. Earlier this month, NextEra Energy joined a coalition of 45 other companies with a combined approximately $1 trillion in market capitalization and sending a letter to the Secretaries of Energy & Treasury and the White House advocating for programmatic policies for the implementation of the IRAs green hydrogen production tax credit. This coalition is advocating for prudent policy that will foster investment in green hydrogen technology paving the way for the US to become the world leader in hydrogen technology. A key aspect of this policy is for the electricity consumed for green hydrogen production to be matched to its renewable power generation on an annual rather than an hourly basis. We believe that an annual matching construct has several benefits over hourly including lower green hydrogen prices, more renewables being built, a significant reduction in carbon emissions, and green hydrogen achieving cost parity with gray and blue hydrogen both of which rely on fossil fuels for their production. This viewpoint is supported by numerous third-party studies from respected entities such as Wood Mackenzie, Rhodium Group, Energy Futures Initiative, Energy and Environmental Economics, and MIT Energy Institute. As we continue to work with the industry and government representatives to progress a smart hydrogen policy, we are also advancing our green hydrogen development efforts including a recently executed Memorandum of Understanding for a joint venture with CF Industries, the world's largest producer of ammonia to develop -- to deliver green hydrogen to an existing CF Industries ammonia production facility which it intends to expand and incorporate green hydrogen into its production process. The proposed facility includes an approximately 450-megawatt renewable energy solution, powering a 40 tons per day hydrogen facility. This project combined with other opportunities we are pursuing represent significant momentum for green hydrogen, which we believe will continue to be a driver of new renewables growth going forward. Our team continues to engage with multiple potential partners and customers on hydrogen projects, representing over $20 billion of capital investments and requiring more than 15 gigawatts of new renewables to support. As we focus on leading the decarbonization of the US economy, building additional transmission is essential to support long-term renewables deployment. We believe our ability to build, own and operate transmission as a key competitive advantage for our renewables business, in addition to being a terrific investment opportunity. We are pleased that the California ISO recently recommended for approval of approximately $400 million in transmission and substation upgrades for NextEra Energy Transmission, subject to approval by the CAISO Board of Governors in May. We believe these projects along with others could unlock up to 11 gigawatts of new renewable generation that could be built to support California's ambitious clean energy goals. Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the first quarter of 2023 GAAP earnings attributable to NextEra Energy were $2.086 billion or $1.04 per share. NextEra Energy's 2023 first quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were approximately $1.678 billion and $0.84 per share respectively. Adjusted earnings for the Corporate and Other segment decreased results by $0.03 per share year-over-year, primarily driven by higher interest rates. In March, S&P affirmed all its ratings for NextEra Energy and lowered its downgrade threshold for its funds from operations or FFO to debt metric from the previous level of 20% to the current level of 18%. In making this favorable adjustment, S&P acknowledged improvement in Energy Resources business risk following the passage of the IRA, particularly noting the improved visibility and clarity into long-term cash flows. At the same time, S&P adjusted its treatment of non-recourse project debt associated with FERC Regulated investments to bring it back on credit. We believe this overall favorable adjustment, which creates roughly 50 bps of additional headroom against the downgrade threshold, highlights the attractive risk profile of renewables and acknowledges the long-term stable cash flows and Energy Resources business, particularly given the benefits of the IRA. Finally as we have discussed in the past, we actively enter into various interest rate swaps products to manage interest rate exposure on future debt issuance. Today, we have $21 billion of interest rate swaps at NextEra Energy to help mitigate the impact of potential future increases in rates, which exceeds the notional value of our 2023 and 2024 maturities. And as always, the current interest rate environment is taken into account in our financial expectations. Our long-term financial expectations which we extended earlier this year through 2026 remain unchanged. And we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted EPS expectation ranges in each year from 2023 to 2026, while at the same time maintaining our strong balance sheet and credit ratings. From 2021 to 2026, we also continue to expect that our average annual growth in operating cash flow will be at or above our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. We also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at roughly 10% per year through at least 2024 off a 2022 base. As always, our expectations assume our usual caveats including normal weather and operating conditions. Turning to NextEra Energy Partners. We believe, we have never had more visible growth opportunities than we have today. We have the ability to grow in three ways: acquiring assets from Energy Resources, growing organically and buying assets from other third parties. With significant tailwinds from the IRA, Energy Resources' operating portfolio, combined with its backlog of projects and development expectations through 2026, total approximately 58 gigawatts, providing terrific visibility for NextEra Energy Partners and Energy Resources is continuing to grow in innovative ways, adding new technologies and clean energy assets to its portfolio, such as RNG and hydrogen. In addition to acquiring assets from Energy Resources, NextEra Energy Partners also has the ability to repower its existing assets, with approximately 1,300 megawatts of potential wind repowerings, already identified, and many more opportunities expected to come, as well as potential to locate storage at its existing renewable assets, given the new stand-alone storage ITC. Finally, there are significant acquisition opportunities with renewable portfolios, continuously being brought to market. NextEra Energy Partners also has numerous ways that can finance this growth and we believe, it can do so efficiently, given its ample liquidity and access to capital. At the end of the first quarter, NextEra Energy Partners had $2.8 billion of liquidity and approximately $6 billion of interest rate swaps to manage future interest rate volatility on debt maturities through 2026. With regard to convertible equity portfolio financing, we can fund equity buyouts by delivering common units or utilizing our at-the-market or ATM program or a combination of both and we believe we have ample liquidity to fund cash payments. Importantly, we have flexibility and we expect to leverage this flexibility to manage future buyouts to select the most efficient option. Using this flexibility, NextEra Energy Partners has now bought out 50% of the STX Midstream convertible equity portfolio financing through funds generated from a combination of the ATM program, where NextEra Energy Partners was able to be opportunistic and cash from a subsidiary's revolving credit facility. With the buyouts of the 2018 convertible equity portfolio financing and 50% of the STX Midstream convertible equity portfolio financing complete, we estimate that the convertible equity portfolio financing structure has resulted in approximately 55% and 64% respectively or 16 million fewer units being issued, compared to raising capital with underwritten block equity, all for the benefit of unitholders. For the balance of the year, files are now expected to be limited to the remaining 50% of the STX Midstream convertible equity [ph] portfolio financing and 15% of the net renewables to convertible equity portfolio financing with the equity portion of these buyouts requiring common units of approximately $280 million and $130 million respectively. Over the next eight months, we have flexibility and time to opportunistically manage these buyouts in the most efficient way. For each buyout, we have the flexibility to deliver common units to the convertible equity portfolio financing investor, utilize the ATM program or some combination of the two. Ultimately, we will select the most efficient option. In any event, the potential unit issuance from these buyouts are not expected to exceed an average of three days of total trading volume per quarter, which we expect will make them quite manageable. Most importantly, NextEra Energy Partners' growth expectations through 2026 already factor in its financing plan, including convertible equity portfolio financing buyouts at current trading yields. Turning to distribution growth. Yesterday the NextEra Energy Partners Board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.8425 per common unit or $3.37 per common unit on an annualized basis, up approximately 15% from a year earlier. Inclusive of this quarter, NextEra Energy Partners has grown its LP distribution per unit up nearly 350% since the IPO. Today we are pleased to announce that NextEra Energy Partners has entered into an agreement with Energy Resources to acquire an approximately 690-megawatt portfolio of long-term contracted operating wind and solar projects and attractive cash available for distribution yield. The high-quality portfolio has a cash available for distribution, weighted average remaining contract life of approximately 16 years, an average customer credit rating of BBB at S&P and Baa2 at Moody's Investors Service. NextEra Energy Partners is expected to acquire the portfolio for approximately $708 million, subject to closing adjustments and is inclusive of the portfolio's existing project debt and interest rate swaps which are estimated to be approximately $142 million. In addition to the approximately $708 million purchase price, NextEra Energy Partners is also expected to assume the portfolio's existing tax equity financing balance. The remaining purchase price is expected to be funded by a combination of new project finance debt and the corporate revolving credit facility. The portfolio of assets is expected to contribute adjusted EBITDA of approximately $110 million to $130 million and cash available for distribution prior to the existing project debt service of approximately $62 million to $72 million, each on a five-year average annual run rate basis, beginning December 31 2023. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of this year. Additional details on the portfolio of assets to be acquired by NextEnergy Partners can be found in the appendix of today's presentation. Next Energy Partners will remain opportunistic pursuing acquisitions in 2023. And with the closing of the transaction announced today, NextEnergy Partners expects to be well positioned to meet its year-end 2023 adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution run rate expectations. Turning to the detailed results. NextEra Energy Partners delivered first quarter adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution results in line with management's expectations. Adjusted EBITDA of $447 million increased by $35 million versus the prior year, driven primarily by favorable contributions from the approximately 1,200 net megawatts of new projects acquired in 2022. Both adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distributions were negatively affected by lower resource from existing projects. Additionally, cash available from distribution was lower versus the prior year comparable period due to incremental debt service and timing of payable payments. Looking forward in the second half of 2023, we expect strong double-digit growth in adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution to support NextEra Energy Partners, distribution per unit growth expectation range of 12% to 15% for the full year 2023. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide. NextEra Energy Partners continues to expect run rate contributions for adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distributions from its forecasted portfolio at December 31, 2023, to be in the ranges of $2.22 billion to $2.42 billion and $770 million to $860 million respectively. As a reminder, year-end 2023 run rate projections reflect calendar year 2024 contribution from the forecasted portfolio at year-end 2023 and include the impact of IDR fees, which we treat as an operating expense. As always, our expectations are subject to our usual caveats including normal weather and operating conditions. From a base of our fourth quarter 2022 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $3.25, we continue to see 12% to 15% growth per year in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2026. We continue to remain comfortable with these growth expectations. And in fact even at the current trade yield, Energy Resources portfolio alone is just one way NextEra Energy Partners believes it can meet its growth expectations through 2026. For 2023, we expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2023 distribution that is payable in February 2024 to be in a range of $3.64 to $3.74 per common unit. We also continue to expect to achieve our 2023 distribution growth of 12% to 15%. In summary, we continue to believe that both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners are well-positioned to continue delivering on their long-term growth prospects. At FPL that means executing on smart capital investments to deliver on its customer value proposition of low bills, high reliability and outstanding customer service. At Energy Resources that means leading the decarbonization of both the power sector and non-power sector and leveraging its competitive advantages to capitalize on low-cost renewals and new emerging technologies like green hydrogen. In NextEra Eneregy Partners, we expect to capitalize on its unmatched growth visibility to further expand its best-in-class clean energy portfolio to provide long-term distribution growth for unit holders. With that, we are happy to address your questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Steven Fleishman: Yeah. Thank you. Good morning. So first a couple of questions on the NEP drop. So just -- should -- I think you're looking at the CAFD yield is the midpoint of the CAFD range over the $708 million, which I guess would be about 9.5%. If you were to over time exclude the project debt and exclude the project debt from the base and exclude the payments of the project debt how does that compare to the 9.5% yield?
Kirk Crews: Yeah. So good morning, Steve. Thank you for the question. So you're right the math you're doing is correct. So you're taking the -- on an unlevered basis, it is 9.5% CAFD yield. So the -- at the midpoint of the CAFD that we provided is a 9.5% CAFD yield. And the reason for that Steve is because the debt that is included is going to be paid off in about three years. And so we felt like that was the appropriate way to present the CAFD yield. If you included the debt it would actually be a much higher CAFD yield. It would be 10.4% CAFD yields. And so -- but as you're probably aware, we've typically provided that figure as an unlevered number.
Steve Fleishman: Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then the amount of tax equity just to kind of round this out. 
Kirk Crews: Sure. Sure. Yeah the amount of tax equity is $165 million and that will be disclosed in the 10-Q that we'll be filing either later today or tomorrow. 
Steve Fleishman: Okay. And Kirk, I think you said something about the growth through 2026 could just come from the I don't know if that was from the NEP portfolio or I guess maybe from the near portfolio. Could you just clarify what you said there? 
Kirk Crews: Sure. Yeah. Yeah happy to do that Steve. So look as I shared in our prepared remarks we have Energy partners the growth visibility that NextEra Energy Partners has is never been better. And when you think about the visibility that has been enhanced really with the passage of the IRA and just take through the three steps that we go through the three ways that NextEra Energy Partners can grow and Energy Resources and you look at the existing portfolio that exists today at Energy Resources and then you combine that with the current backlog which today is 20.4 gigawatts and then you combine that with the development expectations as we disclosed that's 58 gigawatts. And then you also consider the organic growth opportunities that NextEra Energy Partners has. And the passage of the IRA has really unlocked optionality that exists in the portfolio at NextEra Energy Partners. And so we now have tremendous opportunity to grow organically through re-powerings. And as we said we're pursuing 1.3 gigawatts of repowerings now. And we also have the ability to look at co-locating storage within the footprint as well. And then obviously as you see there's just a tremendous number of renewable portfolios coming to the market. And NextEra Energy Partners has had a history of being able to execute on those opportunities those third-party opportunities because of many of the advantages that we have in terms of being able to operate and cost of capital advantages. So NextEra Energy Partners has tremendous growth visibilities. But with respect to your question the statement we made is when you're looking -- when we look at the ability to achieve the 12% to 15% LP distribution growth we believe we can achieve that just looking at Energy Resources portfolio alone. And that space at the current trading yield as well and includes our current financing plan that assumes the buyout of all the convertible equity portfolio financing as well. 
Steve Fleishman: Okay. That's helpful. I'm sure others will have questions on that topic. But one other thing I guess just on the overall renewable development environment. Maybe Rebecca you could just talk to what the -- we've now seen I think some stabilization and a lot of the pressures last year, but we've also seen lower gas prices. Just when you look at the overall environment, could you give us some kind of color on what you're seeing and conviction on hitting the development targets that you have out there or maybe hopefully better? Thanks.
Rebecca Kujawa : Steve, good morning. So we continue to see a very strong renewables development environment. And I think the 2 gigawatts that we added to the backlog is a great sign of that, and it's a mix of wind solar and battery storage in that portfolio and the conversations that we continue to have both with customers in the power sector as well as customers outside of the power sector remain quite robust. And if anything I'm concerned about whether or not we have -- we and everybody else have enough renewables in order to support the demand in short. And of course longer-term, we are planning accordingly to make sure that we have all the projects available for our customers. I'd say if there is one thing that I've seen change over the last year in our discussions with our customers, it's really an increased emphasis on partners that have the ability to execute. It's not lost on anybody inside the power sector or outside the power sector that the demand for renewables is really strong and there are challenges to building projects successfully and ultimately operating them long-term for the benefit of customers. And our conversations with customers now reflect that I think appropriately. And we've had some terrific engagements with customers across the board about making sure that we are building what they need for the long-term and their needs are quite significant. The other thing I would highlight that's been very significant development over the last year and really in the last nine months since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act is really around hydrogen. And I know we've talked about it lot. And today we wanted to give you some additional color on what we're seeing. And I think that $20 billion of pipeline projects with partners and customers that we're now working on. And honestly that's growing by day and requires just for that $20 billion worth of projects over 15 gigawatts of new renewables to be built to support them. This is unlike any time that we've seen in our industry and of course in our customer -- in our company's history of being able to have significant visibility to tremendous growth and tremendous innovation across the board. We couldn't be more excited about with that.
Steve Fleishman: Okay. Thank you.
Rebecca Kujawa : Thanks, Steve.
Operator: The next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith : Hi. Good morning, team. Thank you for the time here. Just first following up with the backlog. Just can you elaborate a little bit on what you're seeing here? It seems like you're adding beyond 2026. How are you thinking about potential for acceleration here off of the numbers that you've articulated thus far in the four-year period? And then related how much of that is hydrogen in total if you can kind of give us at least some initial disclosure on that front. 
Rebecca Kujawa : Thanks Julien. It's Rebecca. I'll take that. So we continue to feel and I didn't directly answer Steve's question, so I appreciate you giving me another shot at it. I feel very good about our development expectations across the board. Obviously, we're now -- we're at the low end of the range for 2023 and 2024 and continue to feel very well positioned to meet the longer-term expectations across the four-year period. And with the comments I just made and Kirk made on the call, we couldn't be more excited about what's beyond the 2026 time frame. I do think the hydrogen opportunity is probably more -- not probably, it is definitively more past 2026 than in 2026 for a lot of practical reasons, not the least of which is needing clarity on the treasury guidance, which of course affects the customer discussions that we're having today. It also affects the way manufacturers are committing to their ramp-up of their capabilities to produce electrolyzers in particular. And, of course, as that clarity comes to fruition and hopefully in particular we realize the annual matching guidance for the hydrogen production tax credit all of that will start to accelerate. And then on top of that, we continue to see tremendous innovation across the clean tech space. Just over the last two years I was looking at the numbers from Bloomberg New Energy Finance and its $100 billion invested in clean tech across the venture capital space. So just tremendously exciting innovations that we're seeing and I think will really make a huge difference in the latter part of this decade.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. And just quickly going back to NEP quickly. How do you think about using ATM to buy out the remaining CPIF [ph] they come due? Further should we assume issuing new CPIF on a rolling basis as credit facilities are refinanced right again obviously right now this is temporary financing in some respects. And then ultimately how do you think about the IDR potential holidays and other tools in the current environment?
Kirk Crews: All right. So Julien I'll try to work off all those questions and the team will make sure I get to them all. So the first question was around the use of the ATM. So look as we shared in the prepared remarks, we have the flexibility to be opportunistic to use -- to deliver to the investor either directly units or to use the ATM on the buyouts. And so you should expect us to use that flexibility and to be opportunistic around those options. And so if we go to the ATM, there's some value to go into the ATM at times to deliver. And there's also -- there will be times where it's just beneficial to deliver the units. So we have both those tools and we can use them. In terms of using unit CPIF in the future. As we share today the CPIF have provided benefits for unitholders. And when you compare it to the alternative, which is doing an underwritten block equity deal when you compare those two as we presented on the slide, it has saved unitholders considerably more than 16 million units. And when you compare those two, I think that slide is -- does a really nice job laying out the benefits. And so as we've always done, we will look at what's the best financing option when it's time to finance an acquisition. And we look at all the different financing tools that we have. And as we shared today when we build our financing plan and when we think about delivering on our LP distribution growth, we build a financing plan into those financing expectations and that includes the conversion of the outstanding units. And certainly, if we're going to use a new CEPF, we will build that into the financing plan and what that means in terms of being able to continue to deliver on the expectations. And I believe your third question was around what are the other -- is there going to be something around an IDR holiday or something like that. Look, as I shared in responding to Steve's comment, we have tremendous growth opportunities and in tremendous growth visibility at NextEra Energy Partners. We have a lot of flexibility in terms of being able to finance that growth. The acquisition that we announced today I think is a really strong indication of how we can acquire a very attractive set of assets for unitholders. And so we feel very good about being able to acquire assets and support growth. And so we're focused on being able to tap into that growth visibility and deliver to unitholders that way.
John Ketchum: Julien this is John. Let me just add on a little bit about the ATM and the ability to issue shares directly to CEPF investors. Our first preference I think would be to issue shares directly to CEPF investors. This was a situation where we were able to use the ATM for the first 50% of the STX buyout very opportunistically and we could do it basically at a zero discount and it made a lot of sense to be able to do it that way. It's great to have the flexibility when you have opportunities like that that are presented by the ATM to be able to execute on them. So it's a nice tool to have in the toolkit. But again, we have ultimate flexibility in terms of -- if opportunities present themselves that are very attractive under the ATM, we can explore those opportunities. But again, we always have the chance to just give the shares directly to the CEPF holder. We're always going to do whatever is most efficient for unitholders. We had a slide in the deck today that I think demonstrates the value of the CEPF, the 54% savings on the BlackRock conversion back in 2018, roughly the 65% 66% savings in the 50% STX buyout that we've accomplished so far today. But at NEP, right now we are very focused on execution for the things that Kirk has already gone through. We've got great growth visibility, attractive acquisition today at a 9.5% CAFD yield. And we have a lot of ways to finance the business going forward. There's never been more capital chasing renewables than there is today. There are billions and billions and billions of dollars sitting on the sidelines, waiting to find a home around renewable assets. So I feel very good about the way NEP is positioned. NEP is also very important to NEE. It's a great way to recycle capital that provides tax optimization benefits. We continue to get distributions from assets that we drop into NEP. So the relationship between the two companies is very strong and has been very successful for both. We've got a lot of levers, NEP is very well positioned.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Thank you, guys.
Operator: The next question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.
Shar Pourreza: Hey, guys. Good morning. Just real quick on rounding out on NEP. So I guess the latest portfolio acquisition, the midpoint CAFD yield, 9.5%. It's a bit higher than some of the prior ones. I guess, do you still see attractive economics on new acquisitions? Is it enough to balance out the dilution from the legacy CEPF conversions. So I guess I'm kind of asking a question on accretive economics versus the cost of capital there? 
Rebecca Kujawa: Shar, I think the answer very simply is, yes. We think there are tremendously attractive acquisitions for NEP. And as John just highlighted, Energy Resources finds itself in a position of wanting to recycle capital. So there's a lot of synergy in that. And I think we will always continue to focus on current market conditions when we're thinking about divestitures from a year perspective and acquisitions from a net perspective. And as Kirk highlighted and John emphasized, we factor all of that in as we think about the expectations for NEP going forward and remain very comfortable with NEP's ability to grow the 12% to 15% distributions per unit through 2026 as we reiterated. And having a tremendous amount of both financing flexibility and visibility to that growth through all the avenues that Kirk highlighted.
Shar Pourreza: Got it. And then just on NextEra in general in terms of sort of the inputs we've seen, you guys have announced several earnings accretive data points since last year, right? You've got RNG acquisition hydrogen, organic transmission growth and some incremental visibility on FPL solar deployment. Do any of these investments kind of displace the CapEx, you guys embedded in plan at the Analyst Day? Is there any sort of headwinds we should be thinking about? And ultimately, do you anticipate this to start being accretive to your plan from let's say 2025 to 2026 time frame especially, as we're thinking about the six to eight.
Kirk Crews: So Shar, this is Kirk. Look, we are always – as you know capital is fungible. We're always looking at what all kinds of investment opportunities we have. We lay out – when we laid out the plan at the investor conference, that was certainly pre-IRA. The world has changed a little bit as a result of that. But fundamentally, we feel very good about executing and delivering on the adjusted EPS expectations that we laid out. We obviously are before – at the time of the Investor Day, hydrogen wasn't an economic product. Green hydrogen was not an economic product. It is today because of the IRA and so we're running hard at it. But as Rebecca also outlined, the reality is that is probably a post-2026 realization in terms of what – how it's going to translate into benefits. So there's a lot that we're running after and a lot we're looking at. But most of this is things that we were evaluating and thinking about at the time of the investor conference or things that are going to really come to fruition post-2026 and really either part of the plans post plans but all things that are supporting ultimately the things that we laid out and feel comfortable about in terms of delivering adjusted EPS for 2026. 
Shar Pourreza: Terrific. Thank you guys. Appreciate it.
Operator: The next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Jeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning.
Kirk Crews: Hi, good morning.
Jeremy Tonet: Just wanted to touch base a little bit more on supply chain if you could. If you might be able to provide a bit more commentary on how flow panels stand today versus a few years back and also as well as bringing the supply chain onshore. Just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on how what time line you see that finalizing?
Kirk Crews: Sure. So, as we shared in our prepared remarks I mean we've spent a lot of time thinking about supply chain working with suppliers. It has been a very comprehensive effort. It's been looking both globally and then obviously here domestically as well. Look there's lots of things to think through domestically. We're continuing to work through that as well. It is about trying to evaluate where in the supply chain there might be opportunities in terms of how to participate. But the way to think about that Jeremy is our view has always been we could be supportive through an anchor order, we could help provide support through that mechanism. That continues to be our preferred approach. And we're working with various potential partners in discussions that way and that's continued those discussions continue to occur.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. And just flow panels today, just wondering how that stacks up versus where it was a few years ago?
John Ketchum: Yes. This is John. So, the flow of panels is going very well. As Kirk said we've been active with Customs Border Patrol and panels are now flowing through the ports, really don’t see any material delays to any of our projects, so we feel good about that. And as Kirk said I mean we're in active -- the great thing about a company like NextEra with the capital spend that we have and the sophistication that we have around running a global supply chain, we have a lot of options -- a lot of options, a diversified set of options globally and we're exercising those options and we're exploring new opportunities as well. Obviously, there's a lot of interest in working directly with NextEra given the amount of buying power that we have. We will always be the preferred customer for each of these -- just given the scale at which we purchase and that allows us to drive attractive arrangements, which we think will really help make the business even more competitive going forward. And so, we have launched a number of those efforts, both domestically and looking at some other diversification opportunities globally that will even better position the business, than it's ever been before, going forward to really capitalize on the competitive advantage we have in terms of the buying power around the supply chain.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. That’s helpful. I’ll leave it there. Thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Durgesh Chopra: Hey good morning team. Thanks for taking my question. All my other questions have been asked and answered. Just quickly, I wanted to follow up on the 10-year pipeline. Maybe, can you just remind us, what are sort of the key milestones for us to watch from here on from a regulatory standpoint for you to get approvals et cetera, et cetera? And then, just second, would this be the spending here you mentioned post-2025. Would some of this spending investment be accretive to the current plan you have through 2026? Thank you.
Armando Pimentel: So, it's Armando. The way to think about it is for the rest of the time under the settlement agreement that we have at FPL, so through the end of 2025, what you see in the 10-year site plan is what we have in our plan, right? There's no additional amounts that will be added to that CapEx. So it's really about '26 moving forward. In terms of approval at the Public Service Commission, you'll see that, as we provide the information for our next rate case, most of that -- well, all of that -- all of the big generation in there is solar and there's also some storage in there. So, there's no additional CapEx through 2025 and most of that, you will see when we update our expectations at some point beyond '26. 
Durgesh Chopra: Got it. So the approval -- Armando, thank you for that, I appreciate it. The approval of this plan comes through to the rate case process?
Armando Pimentel: While the approval comes through either the rate case process, because we've got CapEx that we've invested just as general infrastructure or it will come through one of the two solar programs that we have today. So our Sombra solar program and also our SolarTogether solar program. The Sombra and SolarTogether solar program as long as we stick within the guidelines that we reached in the last settlement, those will get approved on an annual basis.
Durgesh Chopra: Got it. Thanks, so much. Much appreciated. Thank you, guys.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. The conference has also now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may all now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-01-25 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator instructions] After today's presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jessica Geoffroy, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Jessica Geoffroy: Thank you, Jason. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full-year 2022 combined earnings conference call for NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. With me this morning are John Ketchum, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; Kirk Crews, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; Rebecca Kujawa, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources; and Mark Hickson, Executive Vice President of NextEra Energy, all of whom are also officers of NextEra Energy Partners, as well as Eric Silagy, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light Company. John will provide some opening remarks and will then turn the call over to Kirk for a review of our fourth quarter and full-year results. Our executive team will then be available to answer your questions. We will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release, in the comments made during this conference call, in the risk factors section of the accompanying presentation, or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found on our websites nexteraenergy.com and nexteraenergypartners.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. Today's presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of historical non-GAAP measures to the closest GAAP financial measure. As a reminder, Florida Power & Light completed the regulatory integration of Gulf Power under its 2021 base rate settlement agreement and began serving customers under unified rates on January 1, 2022. As a result, Gulf Power is no longer a separate reporting segment within Florida Power & Light and NextEra Energy. For 2022 and beyond, FPL has one reporting segment and therefore 2021 financial results and other operational metrics have been restated for comparative purposes. With that, I will turn the call over to John.
John Ketchum: Thank you, Jessica, and good morning everyone. Before I turn to a discussion of our financial results and the future growth prospects, I'd like to make some comments on the status of our review. As a reminder, we reported last quarter that we were reviewing allegations of Florida state and federal campaign finance law violations raised in media articles and a related complaint filed in October with the Federal Election Commission. Our review of information reasonably available to us is now substantially complete. Regarding the Florida allegations, based on information in our possession, we believe that FPL would not be found liable for any of the Florida campaign finance law violations as alleged in the media articles. With respect to the FEC complaint, you may recall that it was filed by a special interest group and primarily relies on media articles that allege certain violations of the Federal Election Campaign Act by various parties, including by implication FPL. The FEC process is a confidential, civil administrative process with an investigation only commencing if the FEC votes to do so. We plan to file our response seeking dismissal of the FEC complaint in the next few weeks and do not believe it is appropriate for a complaint such as this to move forward. The total amount of contributions referenced in the complaint is less than $1.3 million and we do not expect that allegations of federal campaign finance law violations taken as a whole would be material to us. With that behind us, I would like to now discuss our fourth quarter and full-year 2022 financial results and future growth prospects. Both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners had a terrific year in 2022 and both businesses have never been better positioned. The cost and efficiency of new renewables have improved significantly over the last two decades, while natural gas prices have seen an increase over the past year with volatility likely to continue going forward. At the same time, landmark renewables legislation was entered into law last fall. After the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, we often said it was transformational for our industry and our business. Before IRA, we largely qualified for two federal incentives -- wind production tax credits and solar investment tax credits. We always had the challenge of planning the business with those federal incentives expected to phase down and expire in a few months or years. Some years they were extended, others they were not. The uncertainty changed customer behavior and it changed our behavior.  Today, the incentives are clear. They support a broader range of renewable technologies. They are in place for a much longer period of time. And they incentivize a domestic supply chain that will further reduce the cost of renewables that are made in the USA, creating new American jobs. In short, we believe the IRA provides growth visibility for a broad range of low-cost clean energy solutions, in a predictable way and for a long time. We believe that, in this environment, low-cost renewables will help NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners continue to drive long-term value for our customers and our shareholders and unitholders. So today, I am excited to share that we are extending our financial expectations for an additional year at both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners and I look forward to sharing more details on those expectations in a few minutes. In 2022, NextEra Energy continued its long track record of outstanding execution, delivering full-year adjusted earnings per share of $2.90, up nearly 14% from 2021. As a result of strong operational and financial performance at both FPL and Energy Resources, we achieved the high-end of our adjusted EPS expectations range. Over the past 10 years, we have delivered compound annual growth and adjusted EPS of roughly 10% for our shareholders, which is the highest among all top 10 power companies. NextEra Energy outperformed the S&P 500 Index by nearly 10% in 2022, despite a challenging year in the financial markets. In terms of total shareholder return, NextEra Energy has outperformed the S&P 500 Index and the S&P 500 Utilities Index on a three, five, 10 and 15-year basis. Over the past 15 years, we have outperformed nearly all of the other companies in the S&P 500 Utilities Index and more than tripled the average total shareholder return of the index. Over the same period, we have outperformed 75% of the companies in the S&P 500, while nearly tripling the average total shareholder return of the index. We are proud of our long-term track record of creating shareholder value, but we remain intensely focused on execution at both FPL and Energy Resources and we remain committed to delivering long-term growth for shareholders going forward. We have a long history of executing and delivering on our commitments, even in periods of uncertainty and disruption, and 2022 was no exception. Despite a challenging macro environment, we invested more than $19 billion in American energy infrastructure, while maintaining our strong balance sheet and credit ratings. Overcoming supply chain challenges, we constructed and placed into service roughly 5,000 megawatts of new renewables and storage projects, demonstrating the strength and resiliency of our team's expertise and competitive advantages. While disruption created some near-term challenges, it also created opportunities and I'm extremely proud of our team's execution in 2022 in delivering adjusted EPS growth of nearly 14%. During 2022, FPL successfully executed on its strategic initiatives, while delivering on what we believe is the best customer value proposition in America. Despite inflationary pressures, we further reduced our already best-in-class non-fuel O&M cost per megawatt-hour by approximately 8.6% versus 2021. We also continued our investments in solar generation that can reduce the variable fuel component of our customer bills. We placed into service approximately 450 megawatts of cost-effective solar during 2022 and we anticipate commissioning another roughly 1,200 megawatts of low-cost solar in 2023, bringing our total solar buildout to roughly 1.7 gigawatts within the first two years of our current rate agreement. Our relentless focus on productivity and making smart capital investments for the benefit of customers is a significant part of what has kept our typical 1,000 kWh residential customer bills the lowest among Florida investor-owned utilities and more than 30% below the national average. FPL has also continued to provide exceptional service reliability and was recognized for the seventh time in eight years as being the most reliable electric utility in the nation. Our team responded exceptionally well in response to hurricanes Ian and Nicole. And during a year of high inflation and high natural gas prices, FPL used its strong balance sheet to provide bill relief for its customers. Looking forward, we remain committed to providing clean, affordable, and reliable service to our customers for many years to come. Energy Resources also had a terrific year in 2022, delivering adjusted earnings growth of nearly 11% versus the prior year. With economics driving strong demand for renewables, Energy Resources had a record year of new renewables and storage origination, adding more than 8,000 megawatts to our backlog as we continue to capitalize on the ongoing clean energy transition that is occurring across the United States. With the significant net additions over the last year, our renewables and storage backlog now stands at a year-end record of approximately 19 gigawatts, net of projects placed in service, and provides strong visibility into the growth that lies ahead. Our continued execution, combined with the long-term visibility into clean energy incentives and the strong market backdrop for low-cost renewables, gives us more confidence in our long-term outlook at NextEra Energy. Last June, we laid out our vision and strategy to decarbonize both ourselves and the broader U.S. economy. In August, the IRA helped provide more certainty and flexibility to plan for growth than at any other time in our history. Over the next two decades, we are well positioned to continue our track record of creating long-term value for shareholders through additional renewables and storage investments, expansion into new markets and products that enable even more renewables, and organic growth opportunities to optimize our existing fleet by repowering assets and co-locating storage. At FPL, our plan is to lower cost for customers by accretively deploying capital into low-cost solar, storage and eventually hydrogen. By transforming our generation fleet and continuing our decades-long strategy of fuel-switching, we will not only help customers by keeping bills low but also help the state of Florida achieve energy independence. Our customers have already seen the positive impacts of the IRA on their bills. We estimate that solar production tax credits are expected to save customers roughly $400 million over the term of our current rate agreement. This month, those savings started with a one-time $36 million refund on customer bills for our completed 2022 rate based solar projects. With only about 5% of FPL's generation mix coming from solar today, we are still in the early stages of building out our low-cost solar portfolio. At April, FPL expects to file its annual Ten-Year Site Plan, which will present our generation resource plan through 2032. Last year's plan included roughly 9,400 megawatts of new solar capacity through 2031, including roughly 4,600 megawatts of additional solar after 2025. By incorporating the IRA benefits, we expect the post-2025 new solar capacity in this year's plan will more than double what it was last year. We believe low-cost solar will also provide a valuable hedge for our customers against rising natural gas prices in the future. At Energy Resources, the combination of low-cost renewables, higher natural gas prices and the broader push toward decarbonization across the economy enables our strategy to serve both utilities and commercial and industrial customers with comprehensive clean energy solutions. These comprehensive clean energy solutions are often complex and, in addition to  new renewables, can include renewable fuels, hydrogen, and Behind the Meter projects, all of which are expected to ultimately create even greater demand for renewables. Customers are looking for long-term partnerships with customized solutions at a scale unlike anything we have seen in the past. And we believe that no company is better positioned than Energy Resources to serve these complex customer needs in a way that helps them both save money on their energy bills and meet their emissions reduction goals. We are particularly excited about the potential for green hydrogen and the role it will play as a solution to help commercial and industrial customers cost-effectively lower emissions. We are building the algorithms and tools to identify and optimize the best green hydrogen sites around the country and leverage our significant interconnection and land inventory position. We are using the skills and capabilities that we have developed over the decades that we have led the renewables industry to participate in emerging clean hydrogen markets in a big way, and we are already starting to see some of our early efforts materialize. Last week, we signed a term sheet for approximately 800 megawatts of new solar generation, which we have not included in our backlog, that is expected to reach commercial operations in 2026 and is expected to support a green hydrogen-related facility in development in the Central United States. Additionally, Energy Resources is participating in the development of hydrogen hubs in the Southwest and Southeast. Earlier this month, these hubs were encouraged to file full applications for federal funding from the U.S. Department of Energy under its $8 billion program to create networks of hydrogen producers, consumers, and local connective infrastructure to accelerate the use of hydrogen as a clean energy carrier. In the Southeast, our plan is to support a 140 tons-per-day clean hydrogen facility at our Gulf Clean Energy Center that would be powered by FPL solar projects. In the Southwest, our plan is to build a 120 tons per day electrolysis-based clean hydrogen project in Arizona in partnership with Linde, the world's largest industrial gases company and the largest liquid hydrogen producer in the United States, with whom we recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding. The clean hydrogen produced by this facility would be used to support decarbonization of the West Coast mobility and industrial end-markets. These are just a few examples of clean hydrogen opportunities our team is actively pursuing. We continue to work with various partners on hydrogen solutions and we are excited by both the number and scale of opportunities in front of us. At our investor conference in June last year, we announced Energy Resources development expectations of roughly 28 to 37 gigawatts of new build renewables and storage through 2025. In sizing those expectations, we considered, among other factors, the expiration and phase down of production tax credits and investment tax credits under then-existing tax law. Typically, when tax credits are near the planned expiration dates, we see a spike in demand in the immediate years prior. Then, after tax credits are extended, demand weakens in the short term. Even though tax credits were extended with the IRA, we are continuing to see tremendous demand for new renewables. It is against that backdrop of strong market demand and the continued cost advantages of renewables combined with our unparalleled competitive advantages that today we are extending our development expectations at Energy Resources through 2026. We now believe that we will place into service approximately 32,700 to 41,800 megawatts of new renewables and storage projects from 2023 through the end of 2026. If you compare midpoint to midpoint, our new four-year development expectations at Energy Resources are approximately 15% higher than the previous four year development expectations range that we announced at our investor conference last year. To put these numbers into context, just executing at the low-end of our new development expectations through 2026 would more than double the size of our current renewables and storage operating portfolio, which took us more than 20 years to complete. Due to our long-term visibility into clean energy incentives and the significant growth opportunities at both FPL and Energy Resources, I am pleased to announce that we are extending our adjusted earnings per share growth expectations at NextEra Energy by an additional year through 2026. For 2023 and 2024, we expect our adjusted earnings per share to be in the ranges of $2.98 to $3.13 and $3.23 to $3.43, respectively. For 2025 and 2026, we expect to grow 6% to 8% off the 2024 adjusted EPS range. This equates to a range of $3.45 to $3.70 for 2025 and $3.63 to $4 for 2026. We will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted earnings per share expectations ranges in each of 2023, 2024, 2025 and 2026, while at the same time maintaining our strong balance sheet and credit ratings. As always, our expectations assume our usual caveats, including normal weather and operating conditions. Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners, which had another terrific year of execution, while delivering on its commitments to unitholders. For 2022, NextEra Energy Partners grew its LP distributions per unit by approximately 15% year-over-year and delivered more than 20% year-over-year growth in adjusted EBITDA, highlighting the strength of its operating portfolio. This growth is supported by NextEra Energy Partners' outstanding portfolio of clean energy assets, which was further diversified in 2022. During the year, NextEra Energy Partners acquired interests in approximately 1,200 net megawatts of long-term contracted renewables and storage assets from Energy Resources. Our confidence in NextEra Energy Partners' long runway of growth has been further bolstered by the IRA. Against a backdrop that we believe includes at least two decades of clean energy incentives, we expect NextEra Energy Partners' opportunity set for acquiring renewables from both Energy Resources and from third-parties to continue to be robust. NextEra Energy Partners' organic growth opportunities have also expanded significantly, and we are currently evaluating repowering investments for roughly 1.3 gigawatts of wind assets owned by NextEra Energy Partners for 2024 through 2026. Additionally, earlier this month NextEra Energy Partners leveraged its cost of capital advantages to execute early buyouts of tax equity interests on two of its existing asset portfolios for approximately $190 million. These transactions are intended to enable NextEra Energy Partners to take advantage of the IRA's new transferability provisions, which allow for the sale of tax credits to third-parties. With the buyouts and subsequent transfer of tax credits, NextEra Energy Partners can now fully access two cash flow streams for unitholders -- project cash flows and cash flows that result from the transfer of PTCs. Taken together, NextEra Energy Partners expects these early tax equity investor buyouts to deliver an attractive cash available for distribution yield for unitholders. The significant tailwinds provided by the IRA and Energy Resources' future renewables outlook, combined with NextEra Energy Partners' third-party M&A and organic growth opportunities and continued ability to raise low-cost capital, even in a challenging capital markets environment, provide us with long-term growth visibility. As a result, today we are pleased to announce that we are extending our financial expectations for NextEra Energy Partners by another year. We now see 12% to 15% per year growth and per unit distributions as a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2026. We believe that NextEra Energy Partners' distribution per unit growth expectations are best-in-class versus any other company of its kind in the market and that the combination of NextEra Energy Partners' clean energy portfolio, growth visibility and financing flexibility offers unitholders a uniquely attractive investor value proposition. In summary, both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners have never been better positioned. We anticipate a tremendous acceleration of growth in renewables and storage deployment across the U.S. due in part to the IRA, particularly in the latter half of the decade. And we believe that our substantial competitive advantages will allow us to continue delivering value to shareholders and unitholders for many years to come. Before turning the call over to Kirk, I'd like to talk about the important organizational changes we are announcing this morning. After 20 years with NextEra Energy, Eric Silagy has notified me of his intention to retire from FPL, where he has led the team for 11 years. Eric has been a passionate advocate for continuous improvement and under his leadership, FPL has been transformed into the Nation's largest and most reliable electric utility. Over the last decade, Eric has led the efforts to modernize FPL's generating fleet, making it one of the cleanest, lowest-cost and most fuel-efficient in the country. His commitment to putting customers first is demonstrated every day by FPL's award winning customer service, bills that are significantly lower than the national average and the best reliability in the country. Last year during hurricanes Ian and Nicole, I saw firsthand Eric's dedication and compassion for our customers as he steered the FPL team to quickly restore power and quickly get the State of Florida back on its feet. Over his 20 years of dedicated service to our company, Eric has also been a tremendous supporter of the communities where we do business. His advocacy across the State has helped to foster Florida's economic growth, strengthen our state university system and grow the next generation of Florida leaders, just to name a few of his many accomplishments. I want to thank Eric for his service and wish him and his family all the best on this next chapter in life. With Eric's departure we are excited to welcome Armando Pimentel back to NextEra Energy as FPL's President and CEO. As you know, Armando previously served as NextEra Energy's and FPL's CFO and the President and CEO of NextEra Energy Resources. As a lifelong Floridian, Armando is a proven leader that will be relentlessly focused on serving our customers. He is also a good friend and colleague who I've worked closely with for many years, and I am confident that under Armando's leadership, FPL will continue its long track record of delivering outstanding performance to our customers. Let me now turn the call over to Eric who will make some personal remarks.
Eric Silagy: Thank you, John. I want to start by saying what an honor and a privilege it has been to work for NextEra Energy. This company's performance has been unprecedented in our industry and I couldn't be more proud of the results that we have delivered for our customers, our shareholders and our employees. When I joined NextEra Energy in 2003, FPL relied more on foreign oil to generate electricity than any other utility in America. We knew that we needed to modernize our generation portfolio and we recognized that building a clean, low-cost and fuel-efficient fleet was a great decision for our customers as it would save them money on their fuel bill. Today, that long-term vision has saved FPL customers a cumulative $14 billion over the last 20 years. That's $14 billion that never came out of our customers' pockets and helped them to pay for their kids' education, take their families on a vacation or pay for other family expenses. These efforts began by thinking of ourselves more as a technology company than a utility, finding new and innovative ways to run the grid. And it led to improved reliability, reduced operating costs and a totally different way to approach hurricane restorations. Ultimately, this new way of thinking led to faster restoration times, which has saved the State of Florida billions of dollars. These are just a few examples of how we have transformed FPL into one of America's cleanest, most affordable and most reliable energy companies. While saying goodbye to such a great organization is always difficult, I know that now is the right time for me to hand over the reins of FPL. The last year has been one of the most challenging of my career given a number of distractions, including two hurricanes and significant supply chain and inflationary pressures, to name just a few. When John became CEO of NextEra Energy last year, I committed to him that I would stay in my role for at least one more year and I've now satisfied that commitment. In April I will mark my 20th anniversary with NextEra Energy at which point I will have led the FPL team for going on 12 years, which is well beyond the tenure of most CEO's. We have two more years of execution before our next rate setting proceeding, which as all of you know is an all-consuming process and that I just wasn't sure that I could fully commit to. So, I feel it's best for the transition to take place now and for new leadership to take the helm of FPL to ensure consistent management heading into a very busy next couple of years. It has been the greatest honor of my career to lead the FPL team, and I cannot thank our nearly 10,000 FPL employees and thousands more of our retirees enough for their hard work, for their dedication and for always putting our customers first. They have served our communities and our state with distinction and always challenged themselves to get better every single day. In my opinion, and I'm a little biased, FPL is the best utility in the world. I am so proud of what our team has accomplished, and it is extremely well positioned to continue to deliver exceptional value to both customers, shareholders and to the state. I wish John, Armando and the entire FPL team all the best in their future endeavors. And now let me turn the call over to Kirk for more details.
Kirk Crews: Thank you, Eric, and good morning everyone. Let's now turn to the detailed results, beginning with FPL. For the fourth quarter of 2022, FPL reported net income of $763 million, or $0.38 per share, up $0.07 per share year-over-year. For the full-year 2022, FPL reported net income of $3.7 billion, or $1.87 per share, an increase of $0.24 per share versus 2021. Regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 11.4% for 2022. We continue to expect FPL's average annual growth in regulatory capital employed to be roughly 9% over the four-year term of our current rate agreement. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $3.1 billion in the fourth quarter, bringing its full-year capital investments to a total of roughly $9.2 billion. For the fourth quarter, FPL's net income was impacted by a number of factors, including favorable weather as well as an approximately $40 million pre-tax contribution to charitable foundations that will allow us to continue to support the communities that we serve. For the full-year 2022, FPL's year-over-year net income growth of nearly $500 million was aided by favorable weather, increased customer growth, and effective cost management that supported our ability to continue to deploy smart capital for the benefit of customers. FPL's reported ROE for regulatory purposes is expected to be 11.74% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. During the fourth quarter, we did not use any reserve amortization, leaving FPL with a year-end 2022 balance of $1.45 billion. Our overall capital program at FPL is progressing well. We continue to advance one of the nation's largest solar expansions and successfully met our solar deployment objectives at FPL in 2022. Beyond solar, construction on our green hydrogen pilot at the Okeechobee Clean Energy Center remains on schedule as it continues to advance towards its projected commercial operation date later this year. Earlier this week, FPL filed with the Florida Public Service Commission its proposed plan to recover approximately $2.1 billion of incremental fuel costs incurred in 2022. Under our proposed plan, FPL utilize its strong balance sheet to spread these unrecovered 2022 fuel costs over a 21-month period beginning in April 2023. Additionally, FPL's proposed plan would further benefit customers by offsetting the 2022 fuel cost recovery by approximately $1 billion this year based on the recent drop in projected natural gas prices compared to FPL's original 2023 projections made in the third quarter of 2022. We believe this proposal is a reflection of FPL's customer-centric strategy to navigate challenging environments for the benefit of customers. Separately, FPL is also seeking recovery of approximately $1.3 billion of storm costs incurred in 2022. Under FPL's proposal, the storm costs would be recovered over a 12-month period starting in April 2023 to reduce the potential customer bill impacts that could result from the simultaneous recovery of charges related to future storms. Taking both proposals together, we anticipate that FPL's typical 1,000 kilowatt hour residential customer bills as of April 2023 will remain well below the projected national average and the projected average for Florida investor-owned utilities. The Florida economy remains strong. Over the last 10 years, Florida's GDP has grown at a roughly 6% compound annual growth rate. The GDP of Florida is roughly $1.4 trillion, which is up approximately 10% from 2021. At the same time, Florida's population continues to grow at one of the fastest rates in the nation. Over the past year, Florida has created roughly 600,000 new private sector jobs, and Florida's labor force participation rate continues to improve at a faster rate than the rest of the country. Although we have seen the growth rate stabilize, three-month average Florida building permits, a leading indicator of residential new service accounts, have outpaced the nation's quarterly growth in new building permits by roughly 6%. Other measures of confidence in the Florida economy have meaningfully improved versus the prior-year, including an 11% improvement in Florida's retail sales index and a roughly 2% decline in mortgage delinquencies. During the quarter, FPL's average customer growth was strong, increasing by nearly 74,000 from the comparable prior-year quarter. FPL's fourth quarter retail sales were up 2.1% versus the prior-year period, primarily driven by a favorable weather comparison. For 2022, FPL's retail sales increased 1% from the prior-year on a weather-normalized basis, driven primarily by continued strong customer growth. Energy Resources reported fourth quarter 2022 GAAP net income of $996 million, or $0.50 per share. Adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter were $402 million, or $0.20 per share. For the full-year, Energy Resources reported GAAP earnings of $285 million, or $0.40 per share, and adjusted earnings of approximately $2.44 billion, or $1.23 per share. The effect of the mark-to-market on nonqualifying hedges, which is excluded from adjusted earnings, was the primary driver of the difference between Energy Resources full-year GAAP and adjusted earnings results. Energy Resources' full-year adjusted earnings per share contribution increased by $0.11 versus 2021. Contributions from new investments increased by $0.04 per share due to continued growth in our renewables and storage portfolio. As we previously highlighted, the Commerce Department's decision to investigate circumvention claims led to delays in the development of renewables, which effectively pushed out the completion of certain projects that we previously anticipated in 2022. As a result, contributions from new investments were negatively impacted in 2022. We anticipate that Energy Resources' adjusted earnings per share contributions from new investments will be much stronger in 2023, when we expect many of these delayed projects will be completed. Our customer supply and trading business increased results by $0.12 versus 2021, primarily due to higher margins in our customer-facing businesses and the absence of Winter Storm Uri impacts. Our existing clean energy assets also increased results by $0.02 per share year-over-year. All other net impacts decreased results by $0.07 year-over-year, driven primarily by higher debt balances reflecting growth in the business. Additional details of our full-year 2022 results at Energy Resources are shown on the accompanying slide. As John mentioned, Energy Resources delivered our best year ever for origination, signing approximately 8,030 megawatts of new renewables and battery storage projects. Since the last call, we have originated approximately 1,700 megawatts of renewables and storage projects, including approximately 300 megawatts of wind, 730 megawatts of solar and 670 megawatts of battery storage. Our origination performance in 2022 reflects continued high demand among all customer classes for clean energy solutions that not only help achieve their renewable energy goals but, perhaps more importantly, allow our customers to save on energy costs by switching to lower-cost forms of generation like wind, solar, and solar-plus-storage. Today, we are extending our renewables development expectations through 2026 as a result of our tremendous progress in 2022, strong continued origination success and the strong market demand for low-cost renewables driven in part by the IRA. Our revised expectations are by far the largest expected four-year development program in our history and reflect our high level of confidence in Energy Resources' ongoing leadership position and the continued acceleration of renewables penetration across the country. The accompanying slide provides additional details on our new expectations and where our development program at Energy Resources now stands. As you know, the industry has faced significant supply chain challenges and disruption over the past year and yet our integrated supply chain and engineering and construction teams demonstrated their resiliency by continuing to execute for our customers, and we have been working for over a year with our suppliers to manufacture wafers outside of China. We believe the Commerce Department's preliminary determination on circumvention of anti-dumping and countervailing duties late last year clarified that solar panels manufactured in Southeast Asia using wafers and cells produced outside of China are not circumventing anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws. We are confident that we can source panels consistent with these guidelines by the end of the two-year waiver period. Finally, we continue to advance discussions to support the domestic production of solar panels. Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the fourth quarter of 2022, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $1.52 billion, or $0.76 per share. NextEra Energy's 2022 fourth quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were approximately $1 billion, or $0.51 per share, respectively. For the full-year 2022, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $4.15 billion, or $2.10 per share. Adjusted earnings were $5.74 billion or $2.90 per share. For the Corporate & Other segment, adjusted earnings for the full-year were roughly flat compared to the prior-year. As John mentioned, we invested more than $19 billion in our businesses in 2022, which we expect will again place NextEra Energy among the top capital investors in the U.S. across all sectors. Capital recycling remains an important part of our financing strategy and this year, we recycled more than $5 billion of capital through asset sales and tax equity financings. Additionally, as we have often highlighted, our underlying businesses generate significant cash flow and in 2022, our operating cash flow grew more than 9% year-over-year, despite FPL being under-recovered for fuel costs and incurring restoration costs for hurricanes Ian and Nicole. As a result of this strong cash generation, we proactively paid down nearly $3 billion in 2023 maturities. Finally, we ended the year with $15 billion of interest rate swaps to manage interest rate exposure on future debt issuances. As a reminder, the current interest rate environment is taken into account in our financial expectations. As John discussed, today we are reaffirming our adjusted earnings per share expectations for 2023 through 2025 and introducing expectations for 2026. Details of our new financial expectations are included in the accompanying slide. We will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of these ranges. From 2021 to 2026, we expect that our average annual growth in operating cash flow will be at or above our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. We also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at roughly 10% per year through at least 2024, off a 2022 base. As always, our expectations assume our usual caveats, including normal weather and operating conditions.  Let me now turn to the detailed financial results for NextEra Energy Partners. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $360 million, up approximately 12% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA growth versus the prior-year comparable quarter was primarily due to new asset additions. Fourth quarter cash available for distribution was $74 million. As a reminder, NextEra Energy Partners' operating expenses and interest expense on project debt are typically higher in the fourth quarter versus the first three quarters of the year. For the full-year 2022, adjusted EBITDA was approximately $1.65 billion, up 21% year-over-year, and was primarily driven by the full contribution from new projects acquired in late 2021. Existing projects added approximately $13 million of adjusted EBITDA year-over-year, with the benefits of higher net generation for both wind and solar partially offset by relatively higher operating and maintenance costs versus 2021. NextEra Energy Partners' cash available for distribution was $634 million for the full-year. Relative to the growth in NextEra Energy Partners' full-year adjusted EBITDA, its cash available for distribution from existing projects was also impacted by relatively higher allocation of production tax credits to investors due to favorable wind resource versus 2021. Over the past five years, NextEra Energy Partners' cash available for distribution has grown at a compound annual growth rate of more than 20%. As a reminder, these results include the impact of IDR fees, which we treat as an operating expense. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide. Yesterday, the NextEra Energy Partners Board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.8125 per common unit, or $3.25 per unit on an annualized basis, up approximately 15% year-over-year and at the top end of the range we discussed going into 2022. Inclusive of this increase, NextEra Energy Partners has grown its distribution per unit by more than 330% since the IPO. During 2022, NextEra Energy Partners executed several low-cost financings continuing its successful track record of accessing attractive sources of capital to support growth for unitholders. During the fourth quarter, NextEra Energy Partners entered into a new convertible equity portfolio financing for approximately $900 million with a low implied cash coupon of roughly 2.8% for up to 10 years, to be funded by the investor's share of ongoing portfolio cash flows. In December, NextEra Energy Partners raised approximately $500 million in new convertible notes with a 2.5% coupon, which along with the capped call entered into at the time of the financing provides unitholders with dilution protection for up to 50% accretion versus the NEP unit price at the time of issuance. The implied total cost of the convertible notes represents the most favorable spread to an alternative debt issuance in our history. These transactions executed during the fourth quarter were a continuation of NextEra Energy Partners' successful financing execution throughout 2022. In May 2022, NextEra Energy Partners increased the size of its revolving credit facility to approximately $2.5 billion, nearly all of which is currently available. With this available revolving credit capacity and the final funding of approximately $180 million expected from the 2022 convertible equity portfolio financing, NextEra Energy Partners enters 2023 with significant financing capacity to fund future growth. Additionally, NextEra Energy Partners still has $6 billion of Forward Starting Interest Rate Swaps, which is more than enough to cover its corporate maturities through 2027 and will help mitigate the impact of higher interest rates on future debt issuances, whether for maturities or net new issuances. Taken together, we believe that NextEra Energy Partners is extremely well positioned with significant interest rate protection and ample liquidity to finance future growth and to capture a meaningful share of the long-term opportunity set which has expanded as a result of the IRA. This significant opportunity set and NextEra Energy Partners' meaningful financing flexibility provides us with confidence in our ability to continue to deliver long-term value for unitholders over the coming years. From an updated base of our fourth quarter 2022 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $3.25, we now see 12% to 15% growth per year in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2026, which is an additional year beyond our prior expectations, driven by the partnership's tremendous long-term growth visibility. We expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2023 distribution that is payable in February 2024 to be in a range of $3.64 to $3.74 per common unit. NextEra Energy Partners' run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution at December 31, 2023 remain unchanged. Year-end 2023 run-rate adjusted EBITDA expectations are $2.22 billion to $2.42 billion and cash available for distribution of $770 million to $860 million, respectively, reflecting calendar year 2024 contributions expected from the forecasted portfolio at year-end 2023. As a reminder, all our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and include the impact of anticipated IDR fees, as we treat these as operating expense. In summary, we continue to believe that both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners have excellent prospects for growth both in the near-term and long-term. Near-term, the progress we made in 2022 reinforces our growth outlook and sets the foundation for continuing to deliver on our financial expectations. Long-term, we believe that the low cost of renewables combined with other clean energy solutions enabled in part by the IRA provides us with unprecedented visibility to extend our track record of delivering long-term growth for our shareholders and unitholders, and we could not be more excited about our future. That concludes our prepared remarks and with that we will open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Steve Fleishman: Yes, hi. Good morning. So just a couple questions on the management changes. So you don't appear to be making any connection between the investigation in Eric's retirement. Could you just confirm if that's correct or not? And then I guess secondly, just thoughts on -- often with these successions you'd bring somebody kind of internally up. So maybe thoughts on bringing Armando back who we know well, but just as opposed to the kind of bringing someone internally up? Thanks.
John Ketchum: Yes, thanks, Steve. First of all, on your first question on connection, we're not making a connection. Eric, when I was first chosen to succeed Jim, Eric, and I had a conversation. Eric said, look I will give you a one-year commitment stay at the company. And we would talk about it at the end of the year. Eric satisfied that commitment to me. 2022 obviously was a year with a lot of challenges. The distractions Eric went through in his prepared remarks. But when you think about all the challenges that that he had to overcome with the hurricanes and with high natural gas prices and inflation and the supply chain and on the media allegations and all those things, I think it took a toll on Eric that that year and gave me his retirement notice. And it's, the way I look at it is it's a little earlier than would've hope Eric, Eric would've wanted to do it. And so we have a very deep bench over at FPL. I'm going to your second question now. A very deep bench at FPL. We have a lot of terrific folks that we could move into Eric's role. We have one individual in particular, Christopher Chapel, he is being promoted to Chief Operating Officer as part of the transition. We're bringing Armando back as well. And Armando has been just a terrific friend to me. I have a lot of respect for Armando. I had the good fortune to work with Armando for roughly 15 years. And I think he will do a great job of bringing Christopher along, who I think in the future will just make an outstanding CEO of FPL. But he, Christopher has been running customer service. He needs to get a little bit more experience on the operations side and on -- and working with the regulatory team. And then on the financial side, getting us ready for the rate case. And I think the combination of Armando working together with Christopher that is a very powerful team, and they will do a tremendous job working together to execute on behalf of FPL. And I think Christopher has a very, very bright future with our company. And all of you will have a chance to get to know him and to meet him in the near future. Some of you have had that chance in the past, and I think that should be a familiar name to some of our investors.
Steve Fleishman: Yes, definitely. Thanks.
John Ketchum: Yes. And Steve, I want to just to Eric to say a few words as well.
Eric Silagy: Steve, let me jump in here a little bit. Look…
Steve Fleishman: Yes.
Eric Silagy: Because I'm sure you can appreciate these kind of decisions are never easy, and there's no ever perfect time. As John said with a transition of leadership last year, I gave John a commitment that I'd be here for at least a year. Didn't have any real hard timeline set, but I've been in the Chair for 11 years. This will be going into my 12th year. And my predecessor had been in the job for 10 years. Jim had been in his job for 10 years, before that Lew Hay had been in his job for 10 years. And as I look forward to, this is the kind of job that you have to plan ahead and we're getting ready to go in another rate case cycle. I mean, that's a multi-year type of approach. And so to go forward longer means I'm really committing through 2026. So a lot of factors come into play. John touched on all of the challenges in 2022. I'm really, really proud of how the team handled them. But it's a 24-hour day job. And there are a lot of challenges that we successfully managed, but it's a decision that is not easy, but I feel good about moving forward and putting -- doing it when the company is in its strongest financial and operational position it's ever been in. With a very strong leadership team, I think that's the right time to do it.
Steve Fleishman: Right. Well, I appreciate that color. Thanks. That's the main question we've been getting from people. So just one other thing on the wind -- excuse me, on the backlog, it seems like there's a big increase in wind expectations for the next four years, or the main driver of the higher backlog. Could you just give more color on what's driving? Is that just the extension of the credits or other things leading to more wind expectation through '26?
Rebecca Kujawa: Good morning, Steve. It's Rebecca and I'll chime in on that. It is exactly what John and Kirk highlighted and what we've been talking about for the last couple of months following IRA. With IRA provisions, we now have extensions of incentives now through the end of the decades well decade plus, but just looking into visibility, it's exceptional now through the end of the decade and likely well beyond that. And it is a big change specifically for wind in this timeframe adding the 100% production tax credit now, obviously through this expectation, windows through it fully. And it's also supported by the backdrop of what I also have highlighted to you all. And John talked about in his remarks about all of the positive follow on effects from strong incentives on renewables and through the introduction of a hydrogen production tax credit. We're starting to see substantial demand and positive engagement around renewables to create green hydrogen and hydrogen related products thereafter. So our development team is busy having the types of conversations we've never had before, and we can't be more excited about what's ahead. And that's for wind solar storage and the hydrogen products that we're talking about.
Steve Fleishman: Great. Thank you very much.
Rebecca Kujawa: Thanks, Steve.
Operator: Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning team, and congrats, Eric on your stellar career. Armando, welcome back. Feels a little bit like when Maury came back in 2009 here, I must admit. Maybe just related to some of the changes here, just to follow-up on that super quick. First off is Armando committing to the full process here, as you alluded to the rate case cycle being a little bit protracted. And then related to that what is the final timing in terms of this internal process that you guys had underway per the 8-K and is that impacted at all by this pending FEC process that you allude to taking upwards of the balance of the year here?
John Ketchum: Yes, let me go ahead and take those, Julien. This is John. So first of all on -- with Armando, Armando's committed, he's coming back as our CEO and President of FPL. Armando's committed. So let me just say that. And again, as I said, he is inheriting just a terrific team. I would say easily -- in my own belief, the best team in the industry, and it's a team Eric built and did an outstanding job building, and there's just a lot of strength there. And Armando's has a good fortune of being able to lead that organization. And with Christopher Chapel, as I said too, taking on that that Chief Operating Officer role, I think that's quite a one, two punch that we're going to have over at FPL combined with the existing strength that we already have on the bench there. And the other thing I'll mention is that, Eric, we have the good fortune of Eric staying through the middle of May, which will help ensure a very smooth transition for both Armando moving into to that role. And for Christopher, having a chance to step up, and Eric will do a great job on that transition, and making sure all the right relationships are transitioned as part of that. That's the first piece. The second piece you talked about the internal process and timing. First of all, let me just cover it one more time. I mean, we are substantially complete. On the Florida side, as I said on my comments, we do not believe that FPL would be found liable of a federal campaign finance violation based on our investigation. And second, with regard to the FEC process, let me just say a few words about the FEC process, just so everybody understands exactly what it is. The Federal Election Commission has civil enforcement authority. Anybody in the United States can file a claim with the FEC. And given the political environment that we're in today, I would certainly expect even an uptick in more claims being filed with the FEC, but any citizen can file a complaint. That's where we are right now. A citizen, special interest group filed a complaint. There is no formal legal proceeding or any proceeding with the FEC right now. The FEC will take 12 to 18 months to decide whether or not there is a reason to believe that they should investigate this further. And we will file a motion for dismissal. We think that a claim like this that's based solely on media reports and allegations is not the type of a claim the FEC should take up. If you read the complaint, the complaint details five different scenarios, those, if you add up all the contributions in those scenarios, they don't exceed $1.3 million. And so, when we look at the FEC process as a whole and the FEC complaint as a whole, we do not believe that the federal allegations, taken as a whole, as I said would have a material impact on our business.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. And then just super quickly, if I can, just with respect to the originations here, the 1.7 since the third quarter call, this seems a little bit down from the last quarterly call update in the slides. Can you comment a little bit about the trends? Obviously, I'm cognizant of the comments you made about the overall expectations through '26. How do you think about that materializing the pace and just what customer feedback is in putting in orders, "now versus in subsequent period"?
John Ketchum: Yes, let me take that, Julien. The first thing I would say is the demand for renewables is as strong as ever. When I look at the opportunities that the development organization has right now, they are significant. I mentioned in my remarks the term sheet we signed on the 800 megawatt facility in the Central part of the U.S. for a green hydrogen facility that we didn't even count, for example. And we have a lot of interest around hydrogen right now that's going to fuel a lot of renewable opportunities. The C&I market is extremely strong. We're just seeing a lot of demand across the board. And so I think that's why you see with the revised development expectations, 42 gigawatts on the high end, oh my gosh, I think those of you that have been following the company for a long time, 42 Gigs, that's a 15% uptick on the last four year set that we had, I mean, just to put it in perspective, I mean, FPL's total generation fleet is 27 gigawatts, so to 42 gigs over a four-year period, hopefully that provides a little color and context.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes, absolutely. Thank you guys.
Operator: The next question comes from Shahriar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.
Constantine Lednev: Good morning, team. It's actually Constantine here for Shar and congrats on a great quarter, and just wanted to wish Eric the best in the next steps. Certainly, appreciate that.
Eric Silagy: Thanks, Shar.
Constantine Lednev: Maybe as a quick follow-up to Julien's question, and maybe just on the -- and you've noted prior impacts of the IRA having some pull and push on the demand for renewables, and maybe just specifically on the details of the cadence of the growth to reach those '26 targets front end loaded, backend loaded, anything there?
Rebecca Kujawa: Yes, hi, Constantine. It's Rebecca. I think the best place to point you to is the development expectations slide that Kirk went through. It's Slide 12 in the materials, and it lays out the ranges by technology for '23 and '24, and then '25 and '26. And obviously there's a significant increase in going into '25 and '26 really for all the things that we're talking about, the significant momentum, also a lot of resolution over the last couple of months and clarity around some of the supply chain disruption that we've seen on the solar side. So it is building and the momentum as John highlighted so well remains exceptionally strong on the development and origination side. So I'm really excited about everything that we see in our traditional businesses as well as the commercial and industrial sector. And then of course, the burgeoning opportunities that we see on the green hydrogen and related products side.
Constantine Lednev: Excellent. And on a related note on the kind of upside from repowering opportunities, do you have any thoughts on kind of solar and storage type of repowering? I know that wind is starting to make it into the plan. Just curious on the other side.
Rebecca Kujawa: Yes, we're looking at it and there's, we think there's opportunities over time to repower both battery storage projects as well as on the solar side, there they can be a little bit more complex. And we're certainly looking for some guidance as we go through this year from treasury on this point, as well as others that will be helpful in giving us context. But some of this is also timing. So as you get more mature projects, obviously 10 years on the wind side, five plus years on the solar side will be opportunities then really to expand the horizon for repowering. But as I've talked to our team, every day we're looking at our existing generation portfolio, and I see more opportunities today to enhance the value of our existing portfolio than we've ever seen before. That of course includes repowering, it includes adding battery storage, it includes thinking differently because of the exciting opportunities around green hydrogen about even citing some of those load opportunities, the electrolysis equipment to produce that hydrogen at existing assets. And we're also making investments in transmission across a variety of the integrated system operation markets to be able to add transmission to increase the value of the existing portfolio. So we think there's tons of opportunities and so much more certainty looking forward than we've ever had before because of the clarity around the incentives.
Constantine Lednev: Excellent, thanks so much. Yes, we're running a little bit late, so I'll jump back in the queue.
Rebecca Kujawa: Thanks.
Operator: Sorry, the next question comes from David Arcaro from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
David Arcaro: Hi, thanks so much for taking my question. I was wondering if you could comment on just your latest experience with access to solar panel supply whether there's any risks that you see for executing on this year's development plan and how the UFLPA law has been impacting projects?
Kirk Crews: Sure. Hi, Dave. This is Kirk, I'll take that. So the last time we spoke, I believe was on the third quarter earnings call. And we shared with you that as our integrated supply chain team had worked and certainly had a challenging year in 2022, but as we highlighted on the earnings call today despite that challenging year, they did a really admirable job. We were able to still put into service 5,000 megawatts. And I think that really speaks to their ability to navigate that disruption. And certainly part of that disruption was you highlighted, which was that the challenges around the ports and trying to work through the panels that had been detained and at the ports. And as I mentioned, the challenges around -- in the third quarter that we highlighted with some of the panels being detained there, what we've seen since the third quarter call is some positive improvement. We've seen some of the panels that had previously been detained, released. And so I would describe it as positive movement. We continue to see each day some positive movement. So we're continuing to monitoring it. We're watching it closely. The team is actively working with our suppliers and continuing to monitor it. But compared to where we were in the third quarter I think we're cautiously optimistic that we are seeing progress and at least from our perspective, we continue to feel like it's something that we can manage in terms of continuing to deliver for our customers.
David Arcaro: Okay, great. Thanks for that color. And on the renewables development program, I was wondering if green hydrogen is starting to have an impact on the back end of the plan in terms of influencing the renewables demand outlook yet, like in 2026, are you starting to kind of weave in expected demand on renewables from green hydrogen at that point?
Rebecca Kujawa: It's certainly something, it's Rebecca. It's obviously something that we considered when we are setting the development expectations and what we laid out today for you all. I can tell you from a practical standpoint, it very much is starting to show up in the conversations that we're looking at including the 800 megawatt term sheet that we signed in recent weeks for a project that would be expected to COD in 2026. At this point, I think there are a number of folks and ourselves included working hard to put the right development opportunities together. But it is a very active market. We're really excited about opportunities to partner with key folks, Linde among them, as we talked about in the call, but others as well to put forward terrific projects and really bring forward the promise of this technology that we've now been talking about. But it's really coming to reality. I think '26 is probably on the earlier side of what we ultimately will see as a significant ramp-up going into the end of the decade where there's more opportunity to have supply ramp-up for electrolyzers as well as other related equipment for some of those green hydrogen related products as well as working through the development opportunities and establishing the ultimate customers for these products. But everything I see is really exciting and really starting to take shape just now a number of months after the IRA provisions were ultimately passed into law.
David Arcaro: Okay, great. That makes sense. Thanks so much.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. And the conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-10-28 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and welcome to the NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jessica Geoffroy, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Jessica Geoffroy: Thank you, Matt. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter 2022 combined earnings conference call for NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. With me this morning are John Ketchum, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; Kirk Crews, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; Rebecca Kujawa, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources; and Mark Hickson, Executive Vice President of NextEra Energy, all of whom are also officers of NextEra Energy Partners; as well as Eric Silagy, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light Company. Kirk will provide an overview of our results, and our executive team will then be available to answer your questions. We will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call in the Risk Factors section of the accompanying presentation or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found on our websites, nexteraenergy.com and nexteraenergypartners.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. Today's presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of historical non-GAAP measures to the closest GAAP financial measure. As a reminder, Florida Power & Light completed the regulatory integration of Gulf Power under its 2021 base rate settlement agreement and began serving customers under unified rates on January 1, 2022. As a result, Gulf Power is no longer a separate reporting segment within Florida Power & Light and NextEra Energy. For 2022 and beyond, FPL has one reporting segment. And therefore, 2021 financial results and other operational metrics have been restated for comparative purposes. With that, I will turn the call over to Kirk.
Kirk Crews : Thank you, Jessica, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin today's discussion of our third quarter results, I would like to extend our deepest sympathies to all those who have been affected by the widespread destruction caused by hurricanes Fiona and Ian over the last month. Hurricane Ian was the fifth strongest hurricane to ever make landfall in the Continental U.S. The powerful and destructive storm hit Southwest Florida as a high-end Category 4 hurricane with sustained winds of approximately 150 miles per hour, devastating storm surges and numerous tornadoes, tragically resulting in the loss of lives and causing more than 2.1 million FPL customers to lose power. In preparation for the hurricane, FPL assembled a restoration workforce of approximately 20,000 workers. This preparation and coordinated response, combined with FPL's valuable hardening and smart grid investments, enabled the company to restore service to roughly 2/3 of affected customers after the first full day of restoration following Hurricane Ian's landfall. This represents the fastest restoration rate in our history for a major hurricane. Our dedicated and resourceful workforce was able to restore essentially all FPL customers who are able to safely accept power within eight days. I would like to thank all of our employees who made personal sacrifices leaving their own homes to serve our customers, our communities and our state. It was because of their training, their preparation their dedication and their commitment that we were able to restore power to our customers so quickly. I would also like to thank other members of the restoration team, including the contractors, vendors and first responders that supported our efforts, for their dedicated assistance during this critical time. Finally, we are deeply grateful for the assistance provided by our industry partners who came from 30 different states to help support our customers. Mutual aid in times of disaster is one of the hallmarks of our industry, and this storm was no exception. For nearly two decades, FPL has invested significantly in building a stronger, smarter and more storm-resilient grid. While no energy grid is hurricane-proof, the performance of our system demonstrates that FPL's hardening and undergrounding investments are providing significant benefits to our customers. Despite sustained winds of approximately 150 miles per hour, FPL did not lose a single transmission pole or tower during Hurricane Ian. Additionally, initial performance data show that FPL's undergrounding distribution power lines performed 5x better in terms of outage rates than existing overhead distribution power lines in Southwest Florida. On a related note, we were pleased that the Florida Public Service Commission substantially approved our 2023 Storm Protection Plan earlier this month, which we expect will lead to an even stronger and more resilient grid for the benefit of our customers. Finally, we are proud to report that our generation fleet, including our solar sites, sustained almost no structural damage. Despite 38 of FPL's 50 existing solar sites or approximately 12 million panels being exposed to storm conditions, less than 0.3% of our solar panels were affected, and those impacted were mostly at our older fixed racking sites. Our battery storage sites, including one of the world's largest solar power batteries at our Manatee Solar Energy Center, remained available throughout the storm. We believe these investments, together with our preparation and coordinated response, have improved FPL's overall reliability and resiliency, providing significant value to our customers. Although FPL has not completed the final accounting, our preliminary estimate of Hurricane Ian restoration costs that we plan to recover from customers through a surcharge is approximately $1.1 billion, of which approximately $220 million will be utilized to replenish the storm reserve, subject to a review and prudence determination of our final storm cost by the Florida Public Service Commission. Under its current settlement agreement, FPL is allowed to collect an equivalent of $4 for every 1,000 kilowatt hours of usage on residential bills but can request an increase to the $4 equivalent surcharge given the cost exceeded $800 million. We anticipate discussing the surcharge amount and timing with the Florida Public Service Commission in the coming months. Let me briefly comment on the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, and what it means for our customers, for our company and for our industry. At our investor conference in June, we announced our vision to lead the decarbonization of the U.S. economy, and we announced our industry-leading goal to deliver Real Zero emissions by no later than 2045. We discussed our strategy to get there and how every part of our strategy is focused on saving customers' money on their energy bills. We also said in June that achieving our goals would require constructive governmental policies and incentives. The IRA gives us those policies and incentives at the federal level. It also gives us visibility into what those policies and incentives will look like for what we believe will be more than two decades. We believe that the IRA will not only help reduce carbon emissions, strengthen energy independent and security, and create jobs in our industry and in our domestic supply chain, but also and most importantly will reduce the cost of energy for everyone. We can already see some of the positive impacts of the IRA on customer bills at FPL. Last month, we filed with the Florida Public Service Commission our estimate that the solar production tax credits in the IRA are expected to save customers nearly $400 million over the course of our current rate agreement. Those savings start with a onetime $25 million refund through the capacity cost recovery clause in January 2023 to reflect the solar PTCs on our completed 2022 rate-based solar projects, subject to a review by the commission, which we expect later this year. Looking forward for our FPL customers, we believe that the IRA makes every solar project, every battery storage project, every renewable gas project and every green hydrogen project more cost-effective. And these solar battery storage, renewable gas and green hydrogen projects are designed to reduce the impact that fuel volatility can have on customer bills. We believe the IRA will help make Florida an even better place to raise a family or build a business as we work toward our goal of delivering 100% carbon emissions free energy affordable and reliably. We believe the IRA will also make clean energy cheaper for our customers at Energy Resources. We have never been more excited about our opportunity to partner with customers to decarbonize the power sector as well as broader parts of the U.S. economy. The IRA provides decades of visibility to low-cost renewables, and that visibility has already encouraged our power sector customers and customers outside the power sector to think big about how they can realize the value of renewables to reduce cost and emissions. As a world leader in renewables with deep energy market expertise, we were having conversations with customers about large-scale opportunities unlike anything we have seen in the past. And while some will take time to develop, we cannot be more excited about the future. Turning now to our financial performance. NextEra Energy delivered strong third quarter results, with adjusted earnings per share increasing by approximately 13% year-over-year. FPL increased earnings per share by $0.07 year-over-year, growing regulatory capital employed by approximately 11% over the prior year period. We have highlighted in the past our smart capital investments in fuel efficiency, combined with our best-in-class O&M performance and productivity initiatives, provide significant benefits to customers and have allowed us to continue to deliver residential bills well below the national average and the lowest among all of the Florida investor-owned utilities. At Energy Resources, adjusted earnings per share increased by $0.06 year-over-year. We continue to capitalize on a terrific environment for renewables development, originating approximately 2,345 megawatts of new renewables and storage since the last call. With economics as a significant driver, Energy Resources continues to capitalize on strong renewables demand from both power and non-power sector customers, particularly in light of high power prices and high natural gas prices. Overall, we are well positioned to achieve our long-term financial expectations, subject to our usual caveats. For the third quarter of 2022, FPL reported net income of nearly $1.1 billion or $0.54 per share, which is an increase of $147 million and $0.07 per share, respectively, year-over-year. Regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 11% over the same quarter last year and was the principal driver of FPL's earnings per share growth of approximately 15%. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $2 billion in the third quarter, and we continue to expect our full year capital investments to total roughly $8.5 billion. FPL's reported ROE for regulatory purposes is expected to be approximately 11.8% for the 12 months ended September 2022. Largely as a result of warm weather, we have fully restored our surplus depreciation reserve, leaving FPL with a balance of approximately $1.5 billion to use over the term of the current settlement agreement. As a reminder, our 2021 settlement agreement provided a mechanism whereby a sustained increase in 30-year Treasury Bond yields would trigger an increase in FPL's authorized ROE range. Accordingly, the Florida Public Service Commission approved an increase in FPL's authorized midpoint ROE from 10.6% to 10.8% with an allowed range of 9.8% to 11.8%, which became effective on September 1, 2022. Importantly, FPL will not increase base rates as a result of triggering the increased authorized ROE. For the full year 2022, FPL continues to target an 11.6% ROE but is allowed to earn at the high end of the revised range, which may occur based on, among other things, warmer-than-expected weather. The Florida economy continues to be healthy. Florida's unemployment rate of approximately 2.7% remains below the national average and at its lowest level in more than 15 years. Florida's labor force participation rate remains strong. In spite of significant inflationary pressures across many parts of the U.S., customer sentiment and Florida ticked up slightly in the third quarter. However, the August reading of the three-month average of new building permits in Florida declined year-over-year, which is not a surprise given the significant growth we have observed since the pandemic and the recent increase in mortgage rates. We continue to believe that Florida offers a unique value proposition and will continue to show strong population growth over the coming decades. FPL's average number of customers increased by nearly 83,000 or 1.5% versus the comparable prior year quarter driven by continued strong underlying population growth. FPL's third quarter retail sales increased 3.8% from the prior year comparable period. For the third quarter, we estimate that warmer weather had a positive year-over-year impact on usage per customer of approximately 2.9% and that Hurricane Ian had a negative impact of approximately 0.4%. After taking these factors into account, third quarter retail sales increased 1.3% on a weather-normalized basis, with a strong continued customer growth contributing favorably. Energy Resources reported third quarter 2022 GAAP earnings of $655 million or $0.33 per share. Adjusted earnings for the third quarter were adjusted earnings per share of more than 19% year-over-year. Contributions from new investments increased $0.02 per share versus the prior year, primarily reflecting continued growth in our renewable portfolio. Our existing generation and storage assets decreased results by $0.02 per share, primarily due to unfavorable wind resource during the third quarter, which was the third lowest wind resource quarter on record over the past 30 years. Our customer supply and trading business contributed $0.06 year-over-year primarily due to higher margins in our customer-facing businesses. All other net impacts were roughly flat year-over-year. Additional details of our third quarter results are shown on the accompanying slide. As I mentioned earlier, Energy Resources had another terrific quarter of origination, signing approximately 2,345 gigawatts of new renewables and storage projects since our last earnings call. Specifically, we originated approximately 1,215 megawatts of wind, 965 megawatts of solar and 165 megawatts of battery storage projects. Included in these solar additions is approximately 270 megawatts of post-2025 delivery. With these new additions, net of approximately 1.3 gigawatts of projects placed in service and roughly 680 megawatts of projects removed from our backlog, our renewables and storage backlog now stands at roughly 20,000 megawatts and provides strong visibility into the significant growth that is expected at Energy Resources over the next few years. Our development expectations through 2025 are unchanged from what we disclosed at our investor conference in June and reflect a planned renewables and storage build that is, at the midpoint, more than 20% larger than the entire renewables operating portfolio at Energy Resources today. The accompanying slide provides additional details on where our development program at Energy Resources now stands. As previously discussed, we believe Energy Resources is better positioned than anyone in our sector to benefit from the provisions of the IRA, particularly after 2025 when incentives were previously expected to expire or step down. With what we believe is over two decades of visibility for wind, solar and storage credits, the long-term growth opportunity set is expansive and exciting. Energy Resources is uniquely positioned to capitalize on battery storage colocation opportunities with wind and now has repowering opportunities across this existing renewables footprint. New markets and new investment opportunities are being created for renewables and renewable fuels that require wind and solar as their source.  Transmission will be needed to support this significant renewables buildout. And all these opportunities support our vision of leading decarbonization of the U.S. economy. A key component of our vision is helping commercial and industrial customers meet their sustainability goals by providing them with comprehensive clean energy solutions, including providing renewable fuel alternatives such as hydrogen and renewable natural gas. To that end, today, we are excited to announce we reached an agreement to acquire a large portfolio of operating landfill gas to electric facilities, which will become a core part of our renewable fuels and potentially hydrogen strategies. This transaction represents an attractive opportunity for Energy Resources to expand its portfolio of renewable natural gas assets and grow its in-house capabilities in this rapidly expanding market. Energy Resources intends to purchase the portfolio for a total consideration of approximately $1.1 billion, subject to closing adjustments, plus the assumption of approximately $37 million in existing project finance debt estimated at the time of closing. Subject to regulatory approvals, the acquisition is expected to close in early 2023. In the coming years, we expect to invest roughly $400 million net of the investment tax credit benefit of additional capital into the portfolio of projects, primarily to enable production of renewable natural gas. In our base case, we expect that the acquired portfolio delivered more than $220 million of adjusted EBITDA at Energy Resources by 2025, which is included in our financial expectations. Moreover, the acquisition is expected to deliver double-digit returns. We are particularly excited about additional upside opportunities the portfolio may enable that are not included in our base case and look forward to potentially deploying additional capital and new ventures that may qualify for new federal incentives. Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the third quarter of 2022, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was roughly $1.7 billion or $0.86 per share. NextEra Energy's 2022 third quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were approximately $1.683 billion and $0.85 per share, respectively. Adjusted results for the Corporate and Other segment decreased by $0.03 year-over-year. A hallmark of our business is our financial discipline and forward planning as we grow the business, including the consideration of a range of scenarios to manage interest rate risk. In recent years, we've proactively engaged in liability management initiatives, which we expect to yield significant interest cost savings through 2025. Additionally, we have $15 billion of interest rate swaps to manage interest rate exposure on future debt issuances. With the swaps in place, we're in good shape to manage 2023 and 2024 maturities and new debt issuances despite the current interest rate environment. Finally, the recent increase in interest rates is taken into account in our financial expectations. Our long-term financial expectations through 2025 remain unchanged. For 2022, NextEra Energy expects adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.80 to $2.90. For 2023 and 2024, NextEra Energy expects adjusted earnings per share to be in the ranges of $2.98 to $3.13 and $3.23 to $3.43, respectively. For 2025, we expect to grow 6% to 8% off the 2024 adjusted earnings per share range, which translates to a range of $3.45 to $3.70. We will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted earnings per share expectation ranges for 2022 through 2025, while at the same time, maintaining our strong balance sheet and credit ratings. Inclusive of the increases in our expectations in both January and June of this year, NextEra Energy's adjusted earnings per share expectations reflect a roughly 10% compound annual growth rate from 2021 to the high end of our range for 2025. In addition, for 2021 to 2025, we continue to expect our average annual growth and operating cash flow will be at or above our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. We also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at a roughly 10% rate per year through at least 2024 off a 2022 base. As always, our expectations assume normal weather and operating conditions. Now let's turn to NextEra Energy Partners, which delivered strong financial performance for the quarter. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution were up approximately 13% and 17%, respectively, against the prior year comparable quarter. Last week, the NextEra Energy Partners Board declared a quarterly distribution of 78.75 cents per common unit or $3.15 per common unit on an annualized basis, up approximately 15% from a year earlier. Inclusive of this increase, NextEra Energy Partners has now grown its distribution per unit by approximately 320% since the IPO. NextEra Energy Partners continued to execute against its growth initiatives during the quarter. Since the last earnings call, NextEra Energy Partners completed its previously announced acquisition of an approximately 67% interest in a 230-megawatt 4-hour battery storage facility in California from Energy Resources. This acquisition further diversifies NextEra Energy Partners portfolio into battery storage. During the quarter, NextEra Energy Partners issued approximately $145 million in new equity through its at-the-market program and used these proceeds, along with cash on hand, to fund this acquisition. Consistent with our long-term growth prospects, today, we are also introducing year-end 2023 run rate expectations, which are built upon NextEra Energy Partners' strong existing portfolio and cash flow generation potential and continued ability to access low-cost capital to acquire accretive renewable energy projects. At the midpoints, NextEra Energy Partners' new year-end 2023 run rate expectation ranges reflect estimated growth in adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution of roughly 23% and 12%, respectively, from the comparable year-end 2022 run rate expectations. Overall, we are pleased with the year-to-date execution at NextEra Energy Partners and believe we are well positioned to continue delivering LP unitholder value going forward. Turning to the detailed results. NextEra Energy Partners' third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $377 million, and cash available for distribution was $185 million. New projects, which primarily reflect contributions from approximately 2,400 net megawatts of new long-term contracted renewable projects acquired in 2021, contributed approximately $66 million of adjusted EBITDA and $23 million of cash available for distribution. The third quarter adjusted EBITDA contribution from existing projects declined by approximately $18 million year-over-year driven primarily by unfavorable renewable resource. Wind resource for the third quarter of 2022 was approximately 95% of the long-term average versus 101% in the third quarter of 2021. Third quarter cash available for distribution benefited from higher year-over-year PAYGO payments from both new and existing projects after a relatively strong wind resource period in the first half of this year. Additional details of our third quarter results are shown on the accompanying slides. From a base of our fourth quarter 2021 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $2.83, we continue to see 12% to 15% growth per year in LP distributions per unit as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2025. We expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2022 distribution that is payable in February of 2023 to be in the range of $3.17 to $3.25 per common unit. Additional details of our long-term distribution per unit expectations are shown on the accompanying slide. NextEra Energy Partners continues to expect year-end 2022 run rate adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution in the ranges of $1.785 billion to $1.985 billion and $685 million to $775 million, respectively, reflecting calendar year 2023 contributions from the forecasted portfolio at the end of 2022. At year-end 2023, we expect the run rate for adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $2.22 billion to $2.42 billion and run rate for cash available for distribution to be in the range of $770 million to $860 million. These expectations highlight our continued confidence in NextEra Energy Partners' ability to deliver on its long-term distribution per common unit growth expectations. As a reminder, all of our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and include the impact of anticipated IDR fees as we treat these as an operating expense. NextEra Energy Partners is well positioned to manage financing costs in the current interest rate environment. Approximately 98% of NextEra Energy Partners' long-term debt, including current maturities, is not exposed to fluctuations in interest rate as it is either fixed rate debt or financially hedged. Moreover, NextEra Energy Partners has $6 billion of forward starting interest rate swaps, which will help mitigate the impact of higher interest rates on future debt issuances, whether for growth or maturities. NextEra Energy Partners also has no significant debt maturities in '23, and debt maturities over the next five years are manageable in -- with the forward starting swaps. Finally, I'd like to close with a few words about how we expect the IRA may benefit NextEra Energy Partners and its LP unitholders. In response to the extension and expansion of clean energy tax credits, we anticipate an acceleration of renewables and storage deployment in the U.S. over the next few decades. In turn, we expect that NextEra Energy Partners will continue to have ample opportunities to acquire assets from both Energy Resources and from third parties. Additionally, we believe that the long-term organic growth potential for NextEra Energy Partners has increased, with potential new opportunities to repower its roughly 8 gigawatt existing wind and solar assets and to pair battery storage with this nearly 7 gigawatt existing wind portfolio. Considering the potential impacts of the IRA, our expectation regarding the overall tax position for NextEra Energy Partners remains largely unchanged, including that it is not expected to pay any meaningful taxes for at least the next 15 years. Combined with its current yield and the expectation of 12% to 15% annual distributions per unit growth through at least 2025, NextEra Energy Partners has the potential to deliver a total after-tax return of approximately 20% annually through this time frame. With the ongoing strength of the renewables development environment and all of the market tailwinds provided by the IR, we believe that NextEra Energy Partners remains well positioned to continue delivering on its unitholder value proposition. In summary, we continue to believe that both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners have some of the best execution track records in the industry, and we are extremely excited about the long-term growth prospects for both businesses and the value we can continue to create for both customers and shareholders. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we will open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.
Steven Fleishman : So just first on the -- last quarter, you had mentioned the 2 gigawatts of potential backlog that could be at risk due to circumvention and the like. And I don't see any updated footnotes on that. So I don't know if that's resolved or -- could you give us an update on those 2 gigawatts?
Rebecca Kujawa : Steve, it's Rebecca. And I'd be happy to start with that answer. First, let me start with the most important part, which is everything that we're seeing at this point in terms of origination at Energy Resources is just terrific. We're seeing strong demand across all the technologies, strong demand across the different customer groups and strong demand across the country. And I feel terrific about meeting the long-term expectations that we've laid out, including reiterating today of the 27.7 to 36.9 gigawatts of new projects put into service between '22 and '25. And I think the origination for this quarter of the over 2,300 megawatts is a great sign to that, and the momentum remains very strong. As you know and appreciate being involved in the development process, there's always some things that can go wrong as you move forward with developing a project where it could be unforeseen permitting or interconnection issues or something else that gets in the way. And so occasionally, we do remove projects from backlog like we did today. We didn't include the reference to the 2 gigawatts mostly because it's going to be harder and harder as time goes by to identify what's related to issues from circumvention and supply chain versus normal development issues. So I think I'd lean more on the side of giving you context for what's going on against our expectations, what's the current momentum. And both of those are just terrific.
Steven Fleishman : Okay. That's good. And I guess just specific to supply chain, any updated things that you're seeing related to UFLPA impacts?
Rebecca Kujawa : Yes, Steve. It continues to be an opportunity for our team to work through challenges that we're experiencing along with the rest of the industry. We've continued to work with the various agencies, most importantly, Customs and Border Control, with our suppliers to bring clarity to these implementing regulations. And while we continue to see progress, it also continues to be slower than we would like. Everything that we've laid out today in terms of our expectations reflect our latest views on when panels will be delivered to us, and we'll be able to bring projects into service for our customers. One of the biggest things that our team has been working on over the last year is how do we mitigate the risks related to these broader geopolitical issues, whether you focus specifically on a circumvention issue or UFLPA or whatever else it might entail. And our suppliers have made tremendous progress on de-risking that. And we've gotten a lot of increased confidence longer term. It will be able to mitigate the issues even if we see some disruption in the short term.
Steven Fleishman : Okay. Great. One last question, just, I guess, on the internal investigation related to the Florida political noise. Is there any update on timing or -- and/or outcome of that?
John Ketchum: Steve, this is John. I'll go ahead and take that. Let me just start from beginning. As you know, media articles have been published that allege, among other things, campaign finance violations by FPL, and we have a core who’s been conducting a very thorough review of those allegations with the national law firm, Paul, Weiss. Late yesterday afternoon, a complaint was filed by a non-profit corporation with the Federal Election Commission that appears to center around some of the same allegations as those that have appeared in a lot of the media articles. So all those allegations that have been made are within the scope of our review. We have a core who's been taking the matter very seriously, and we will continue to do so as we work towards completing our thorough review of these matters as quickly as possible. And that's really the only update I have at this point.
Operator: Our next question will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith : Listen, I just want to jump at the heart of the matter here. How do you think about IRA in terms of increasing your EPS through the 2025 forecast? Or is this about extending the duration of the existing growth and/or both, right? The pivot to the solar PTC from ITC for a host of products already in flight should be immediately accretive, you would think. But clearly, there could be some offsets as well. And then related, the added opportunities in the repowering and storage colocation as you guys quantify just now, in theory, should also afford an accelerated opportunity. But I just want to come back on how you guys want to tackle that from an earnings recognition perspective.
John Ketchum : Yes. Let me go ahead and take that, Julien. This is John. As you said, look, IRA provides a tremendous opportunity set for us across the board. Obviously, we've had some contracts that were already in place that assumed ITC on solar and obviously benefit from the production tax credit. So there's benefits certainly in the existing portfolio. I think we're also going to see some improvement going forward. As I said, I think recently at a conference in our 70-30 in the way things are treated on the unregulated business mix standpoint because, remember, those new PTCs that we get actually helped to buy down the contribution from the unregulated side of the business. So that's a big benefit for us as well going forward. We have transferability options now built into IRA that should help the cash flow from operations as well as we go -- as we think about the future of the business. I mean, obviously, it creates a lot of immediately in the money opportunities for us going forward, both on wind, on solar and on battery storage. Nobody has the existing footprint that we have.  And so having not only a 20-gigawatt backlog, but you combine that with 25 gigawatts of operating renewables, and you just think about the potential opportunity of 45 gigawatts around repowerings and with regard to colocated storage because, as we all know, under the old regime, the only way you could really introduce storage into the puzzle was by combining it with solar. Nobody has the wind footprint that we do. And so now we have the opportunity to put -- colocate storage in all of our wind sites, not only that we own today, but that we might build going forward. The same goes with solar. And then obviously, there's an opportunity now to go ahead and build storage stand-alone. And so that is terrific, not only for Energy Resources, but obviously provides a great opportunity set for NEP going forward as well. In terms of timing, which I think was the other part of your question, I think we've been very open that we plan to provide a further update on the next call in January on the Q4 call.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith : Got it. And just to get ahead of that fourth quarter a little bit, you would have a more holistic update on just the extent that the repowering opportunities and colocated opportunities through, call it, the '25 period by fourth quarter. Again, I get that it takes some time to actually execute to decide what...
John Ketchum : Yes, Julien, we'll do the best we can. Remember, too, that there are some regulations we're working on with the Treasury Department as well. So some of that update around repower and colocated storage might be tied to finalization of those, but we'll certainly try to give a view.
Operator: Our next question will come from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.
Shahriar Pourreza : Just a real quick follow-up on Julien's question. Just -- maybe just fine-tuning it a little bit, as we're kind of looking at just the near-term earnings guidance that you guys have out there, how do we sort of think about the IRA impact as we're thinking about the existing PPAs, right, which predominantly don't have any reopeners, and then you couple that with sort of some of the counteracting items like higher interest rate environment, do these two sort of items, are they offsetting? Are they accretive? I guess how do we think about those two items in the context of what you guys have just reiterated this morning?
John Ketchum : Yes. I think, Shahriar, you've got to balance all those things together. First of all, it's really project by project. I mean some projects benefit more than others, and that really depends on which projects have been impacted by some of the supply chain issues that we have had. That's really the first piece. From an interest rate standpoint, though, I think for -- Kirk dealt with that. I mean, obviously, the current interest rate move is taken into account in our expectations. And I think we've been very prudent and careful about managing that interest rate exposure. I mean we have $15 billion of interest rate swap protection in the book. So I'd really think about it more of -- more as a -- an ITC to PTC versus supply chain trade-offs. Some projects benefit more than others. So you kind of have to go down the list and look at it on a deal-by-deal basis.
Shahriar Pourreza : Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then just on -- FPL, obviously, you had a 10-year site plan adjusted for inclusion of tax legislation. I think IRA came out even better than prior proposals. So does that prompt an update for a preferred solution at FP&L, maybe going from 10 to 20 gigs? What would be the cadence for an update or to pivot resource strategy there?
Eric Silagy: So we'll be filing -- updating our 10-year site plan as we do every year. We're in the process now of updating that. That gets filed on April 1. Obviously, as I talked before, there's opportunities going forward. We're always looking at ways to make it even more economic to be able to deploy the assets, including the solar that we're currently doing. But we're currently five years ahead of plan on our 10,000 megawatts of solar to be installed, and that's on file with the commission, and then we'll update our 10-year site plan and file that on April 1.
Shahriar Pourreza : Got it. Terrific. And then just one last quick one. Just curious on the move in the RNG side. Your '25 EBITDA guidance for the acquisition is based on existing operating assets or does that include a backlog of RNG development that would require additional funding?
Rebecca Kujawa : Thanks. I appreciate the question. We're really excited about the acquisition. It is about just over 30 projects that do landfill, gas, electricity or renewable natural gas today. And that number in '25 reflects our base case. And in our base case, we are converting a number of those facilities from landfill gas to electricity to renewable natural gas. So it does include the investment that we referenced in the prepared remarks of about $400 million in order to convert them to produce renewable natural gas. One of the reasons why we're really excited about the transaction, though, is there's a lot of optionality in it, and some of which was afforded in the Inflation Reduction Act. One is these projects now qualify for an investment tax credit, which obviously enhances the economics of the conversions. There's also the opportunity to support the further decarbonization or the improving of carbon intensity for blue hydrogen, which really opens up a whole new market for renewable natural gas that we think is going to be very attractive to blue hydrogen producers to enable the full value of the PTC where they otherwise wouldn't have been entitled to the full value of the PTC. And in doing that, we think that creates a real long-term contracted market because a blue hydrogen producer will be very motivated to lock in the value that the renewable natural gas lending will bring to their economics. There's also the opportunity, if it isn't a blue hydrogen contribution, actually to keep some of these assets producing electricity and utilizing what we expect are new regulations coming out of the EPA to enable a pathway for the RINs, the predominant renewable fuel credit that renewable natural gas benefits from today, that there'll be a pathway enabled for electric vehicles. So that might enable us to not invest that $400 million in some or all of those assets to convert them to renewable natural gas. So I think the bottom line is we are very excited about it. We think this is a great platform from which to grow our renewable fuel business, our renewable energy solutions in order to help our customers across the broad set of sectors, both in the power sector and beyond to enable their full decarbonization. 
Operator: Our next question will come from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. 
David Arcaro: Maybe continuing on that, just wondering more broadly your thoughts on the M&A landscape, are there priorities or attractive opportunities out there in the market right now that you might be considering?
John Ketchum : I will go ahead and take that. David, this is John. We have so many terrific organic opportunities, growth opportunities in front of us. M&A is not an area of focus. 
David Arcaro: And then, maybe on the renewable side of things, wondering if you could comment on the ICC and FEMA proposal to rate the structural risk ranking of solar and wind? What could that do for your projects, your pipeline and the costs for developing renewables?
John Ketchum: I will go ahead and take as well. So FEMA did come forward with some recent proposals. Those have not been put to a final vote yet. I think the best example as to why none of those changes are required is what we just saw with Hurricane Ian. And so when you -- Kirk had some of those remarks in the script, but I think it's worth noting, and obviously, we put this information back in front of FEMA that none of this is necessary. Because if you evaluate what happened in Hurricane Ian, which was the fifth worst most catastrophic storm to ever hit the Continental United States, it passed over 38 to 50 of our solar sites with maximum sustained winds of 150 miles per hour. We had essentially no impact to our solar generating facilities. About 0.3% of the panels were impacted. And you got to remember, that slight number of impacts that even occurred were on the older sites that have the fixed tracker technology. Now if the new tracker technology, we can move it east to west, we can pivot it to the 35 degrees. The wind cuts right through it. We saw essentially no damage at those sites. The solar held up extremely well. And in some cases, I think probably better than even a gas plant, which are really rated up to only 100 miles an hour. So really happy with the way it all performed. We think the FEMA changes are completely unnecessary, and we are working through that with them with terrific evidence from how our own fleet just performed a couple of weeks ago as a no better case in point.
Eric Silagy : So this is Eric Silagy. I guess I'll just add a little bit. So when John talks about the panels that were -- the 0.3% of panels that were affected, many of those panels weren't even damage at the point we simply put them back on and reuse them. So to put it in perspective, panels that actually had to be replaced out of 12 million panels is 0.03% or 3,000 panels out of 12 million. And so to John's point, it is immaterial. And we were up and running the next morning with output at our plants.
Operator: Our next question will come from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.
Michael Lapides: Congrats on a good quarter. One for Eric. Talk about $8.5 billion of capital deployment this year at FP&L. How should we think about what that level looks like, call it, in 2023 and 2024? And maybe what are the puts and takes that could move it in either direction for those years?
Eric Silagy : Michael, it's Eric. So look, we have a robust capital plan that continues. We've talked about it before from a standpoint of our storm hardening that program. Obviously, you could see the impacts with Ian and how beautifully it really made a difference. We're going to continue with our storm hardening program, our undergrounding program, our solar build-out. We have great visibility into our capital deployed right through the rate case settlement period and what we have filed through our 10-year site plan.
Michael Lapides : Got it. So I'm just trying to think about this just, is capital spend above or below 2022 levels for the next couple of years?
Eric Silagy : It's basically where it is at the '22 levels. It varies a little bit but is exactly what we put forward for the plan here for the last two years that we've had going forward.
John Ketchum : Yes. Michael, I would just add, there's no real deviation from what we shared at the investor conference. So it's in line with the plans that we laid out in terms of roughly $8.2 billion to $8.5 billion a year over the settlement terms.
Michael Lapides: Yes. The only reason I ask -- and thank you for that -- is given the fact you've got the full surplus amortization back on board right now, you could actually invest more to improve reliability, and obviously, green the system even more without necessarily having to, A, hurt earnings; and B, increase customer rates for the next couple of years.
Eric Silagy : Yes. But Michael, again, we're right now sticking with our plan. We've got a good visibility. A lot of this, remember, it's a lot of execution. And so we have a -- we've been managing the supply chain. We've been managing all the issues that have been a challenge for folks across the country and being able to hit that CapEx plan is right now what we see is the best path forward to be able to maintain what the commission expects and, financially, what we expect.
Michael Lapides : Got it. And then one for Rebecca. Just curious, what are you seeing in terms of just -- just given what's happening inflation-wise around the world, especially commodity and labor, what the cost to install new wind and solar has -- kind of how much that has changed before we kind of bake in the higher tax credit levels?
Rebecca Kujawa : Yes. Michael, I think we obviously had a number of comments around this at the investor conference. We certainly have seen increases in costs, both in the -- or the -- actually equipment prices as well as balance the system and the labor to build the projects. I don't know that it's materially changed from what we shared with you a couple of months ago. I think we were at the peak in a lot of commodity prices and even some of the key ones that ultimately affect the inherent costs of our building a project have come down since then. As we think about it long term, we obviously have views on what it's going to look like going forward and that we build those expectations into our Power Purchase Agreement prices with our customers. I think one of the key things to keep in mind, particularly as you think about the overall demand for renewables and other clean energy solutions long term, is that they have such a competitive advantage against the alternatives. So even where we've seen increases in costs, even in some areas, maybe at parity with what we've seen in terms of the strict value that the IRA incentives may have brought in terms of the difference versus prior incentives, what we've seen is that the alternatives have increased even more. And that goes from new build as well as the overall market prices. So from our customer standpoint, which is what -- who we're focused on the most, they are as compelling as they've ever been to incorporate into their solutions, whether that be a power customer to bring down electricity prices for their customers, which is clearly very top of mind for our customers today, but also our non-power sector customers who are finding ways to not only provide a lower carbon intensity product to their customers, but they want to do it at lower cost. And we've got great solutions for them.
Operator: Our next question will come from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.
Jeremy Tonet : Just wanted to hit on RNG real quick and maybe round out the conversation a little bit more, big acquisition here, but how do you think about the total addressable market here? And is the focus really just on landfills in certain locations or other parts of RNG could be interesting as well? And then lastly, I guess, further expansion, it seems like you have quite a platform to work off here, but future RNG would be just organic? Or could there be more purchases as well?
Rebecca Kujawa : And thanks for the question. We're very excited about the potential for RNG, in particular, as part of the broad set of solutions we want to offer our customers. So I would say this is just a large step forward in something we've already been working on with smaller investments and some other co-investments with other folks. And we're excited about not only adding these portfolio of projects and the value that this creates for our shareholders, but also using it as a platform for future growth.  As part of this acquisition, building a services company along with it. That's part of what the existing portfolio provides, and we're excited about incorporating those capabilities into our team. And we are excited about both landfill gas and alternative forms of renewable natural gas, including [dairy] long term. So we'll do it both through organic as well as through acquisitions. So -- and all of the above. We're excited about the size of the acquisition space. But before I get too excited, we also need to keep in mind that as the $85 billion to $95 billion of capital we want to invest over the period we laid out at the investor conference, this is approximately $1 billion and change. So a great addition to our portfolio, but still in context, a measured step in the overall portfolio.
Jeremy Tonet : Got it. Very helpful. And just rounding out the conversation on hydrogen, I think you touched on it a bit, but any other updated thoughts you want to share with us post-IRA here?
Rebecca Kujawa : I'm thrilled with the prospects of hydrogen going forward and not just literally hydrogen itself, but the renewable fuels that, that creates is potential solutions for our customers, whether that's synthetic natural gas as a potential solutions for customers who are looking for 7/24 fully decarbonized power, but also through synthetic jet fuels, synthetic ammonia products, other things that will help bring out of people's supply chain, manufacturing processes, et cetera, their carbon-intensive fuels that they use today. Some of those are not going to be economic literally today, but there's a clear pathway to them being economic in a couple of years, but some of them with the benefit of the IRA incentives are economic today. And at the heart of them, what the opportunity is for us is to deploy a substantial amount of renewable energy in the form of wind, solar, battery storage, the core things that we have been very successful doing for years now, if not decades, and we're continuing to invest heavily to maintain those competitive advantages going forward.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session, which also concludes today's conference. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-07-22 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and welcome to the NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners Q2 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note that today's event is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference call over to Jessica Geoffroy, Director of Investor Relations. Ma'am, please go ahead.
Jessica Geoffroy: Thank you, Jamie. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our second quarter 2022 combined earnings conference call for NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. With me this morning are John Ketchum, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; Kirk Crews, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; Rebecca Kujawa, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources; and Mark Hickson, Executive Vice President of NextEra Energy. All of whom are also officers of NextEra Energy Partners, as well as Eric Silagy, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light Company. Kirk will provide an overview of our results and our executive team will then be available to answer your questions. We will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call, in the risk factor section of the accompanying presentation, or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found on our websites, nexteraenergy.com and nexteraenergypartners.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. Today's presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of historical non-GAAP measures to the closest GAAP financial measure. As a reminder, Florida Power & Light completed the regulatory integration of Gulf Power under its 2021 base rate settlement agreement and began serving customers under unified rates on January 1st, 2022. As a result, Gulf Power will no longer continue as a separate reporting segment within Florida Power & Light and NextEra Energy. For 2022 and beyond, FPL has one reporting segment and, therefore, 2021 financial results and other operational metrics have been restated for comparative purposes. With that, I will turn the call over to Kirk.
Kirk Crews: Thank you, Jessica, and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy delivered strong second quarter results and is well-positioned to meet its overall objectives for the year. Adjusted earnings per share increased approximately 14% year-over-year, reflecting continued strong financial and operational performance at both FPL and Energy Resources. FPL increased earnings per share by $0.05 year-over-year. Average regulatory capital employed increased by more than 11% versus the same quarter last year. With residential bills well below the national average and the lowest among all of the Florida investor-owned utilities, FPL's focus continues to be on identifying smart capital investments such as our planned solar expansion and T&D hardening and undergrounding projects to lower costs, improve reliability and provide clean energy for the benefit of our customers. Having saved customers more than $12 billion in fuel costs since 2001 and with the largest owned and operated solar portfolio of any utility in the country, FPL is well positioned to execute on its goal of achieving real zero carbon emissions by no later than 2045, which we announced last month at our investor conference, while continuing to deliver its best-in-class customer value proposition. At Energy Resources, adjusted earnings per share increased by $0.06 year-over-year. We continue to capitalize on a strong environment for renewables development, adding approximately 2,035 net megawatts to Energy Resources backlog since the last call. Included in these backlog additions is approximately 1,200 net megawatts of solar projects, which is the second largest quarter of solar origination in our history. As we highlighted at our investor conference last month, we believe that a number of powerful tailwinds support continued, strong renewables demand, particularly in the context of high power prices and high gas prices that are helping to make renewables the most economic form of generation. We expect these economic value drivers for new renewables, coupled with Energy Resources' significant competitive advantages to translate into a tremendous opportunity set as we deliver clean energy solutions to our customers seeking to both lower their energy bills and reduce their carbon emissions. We are pleased with the progress we have made at NextEra Energy so far in 2022 and heading into the second half of the year, we are well positioned to achieve the full year financial expectations that we have previously discussed, subject to our usual caveats. Now let's look at the detailed results beginning with FPL. For the second quarter of 2022, FPL reported net income of $989 million or $0.50 per share, which is an increase of $107 million and $0.05 per share, respectively, year-over-year. Regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 11.4% over the same quarter last year and was a principal driver of FPL's net income growth of approximately 12%. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $1.9 billion in the second quarter, and we expect our full year capital investments to total roughly $8.5 billion. FPL's reported ROE for regulatory purposes is expected to be approximately 11.6% for the 12 months ended June 2022. Largely as a result of warm weather during the second quarter, we reversed roughly $44 million of reserve amortization recorded earlier in the year, leaving FPL with a balance of approximately $1.37 billion to use over the term of the current settlement agreement. During the quarter, FPL successfully commissioned the highly efficient, roughly 1,200 megawatt Dania Beach Clean Energy Center. The approximately $900 million project, which was completed on time and on budget, is expected to generate nearly $350 million in net cost savings for FPL customers, while reducing carbon emissions by roughly 70% compared to the previous Lauderdale plant. Longer term, we expect to convert approximately 16 gigawatts of our highly efficient gas fleet to run on green hydrogen, which will play an important role in the decarbonization of FPL's generation fleet as part of our goal to achieve real zero carbon emissions by no later than 2045. Last week, FPL also placed in service the North Florida Resiliency Connection transmission line, which physically connects the FPL grid and the legacy Gulf power grid. The new transmission line is expected to generate operational efficiencies and allow customers to benefit from both enhanced reliability and additional low-cost solar generation. FPL also filed its updated storm protection plan, which is filed every three years. The plan provides details on the billions of dollars of capital investment anticipated over the next 10 years to continue hardening FPL's energy grid for the benefit of customers. These hardening programs, several of which have been in progress since 2007, collectively provide increased resiliency and faster restoration times for FPL's approximately 5.8 million customer accounts when severe weather, including hurricanes, inevitably affects our service territory. The Florida economy remains strong. Florida's unemployment rate of approximately 3% remains below the national average and its labor force participation rate remains strong. The three-month moving average for new housing permits is up nearly 9% year-over-year, outpacing the national rate by roughly 7%. FPL's new service accounts increased more than 15% year-over-year, demonstrating continued strong growth in Florida's economy. FPL's average number of customers increased by more than 87,000 or 1.5% versus the comparable prior year quarter, driven by continued strong underlying population growth as Florida's population continues to increase at one of the fastest rates in the nation. FPL's second quarter retail sales increased 3.2% from the prior year comparable period, driven primarily by a favorable weather comparison. On a weather-normalized basis, second quarter retail sales increased 1.3% with strong continued customer growth contributing favorably. Energy Resources reported second quarter 2022 GAAP earnings of $133 million or $0.07 per share. Adjusted earnings for the second quarter were $683 million or $0.35 per share. The difference between Energy Resources second quarter GAAP and adjusted earnings results is primarily the effect of the mark-to-market on nonqualifying hedges, which is excluded from adjusted earnings. Contributions from new investments were roughly flat versus the prior year, driven by the timing of new solar and storage project additions. For the full year 2022, we anticipate the majority of our growth in new investments to occur in the fourth quarter. Our existing generation and storage assets added $0.03 per share primarily due to favorable wind resource during the second quarter. The second quarter adjusted earnings contributions from our customer supply and trading business increased by $0.02 year-over-year, driven primarily by the absence of winter storm Uri impacts that negatively impacted adjusted earnings in the second quarter of last year. All other impacts increased results by $0.01 versus 2021. As I mentioned earlier, Energy Resources had another strong quarter of origination, adding approximately 2,035 net megawatts of renewables and storage projects to our backlog, which is the third largest quarter of renewables and storage origination in our history. Since our last earnings call, we have added approximately 815 net megawatts of new wind, 1,200 net megawatts of solar and 20 net megawatts of battery storage to our backlog. With these additions, net of projects placed in service, our renewables and storage backlog now stands at approximately 19,600 megawatts and provides terrific visibility into the strong growth that is expected at Energy Resources over the next few years. We remain confident in our long-term development expectations at Energy Resources, which we increased and extended last month. From 2022 through the end of 2025, Energy Resources expects to build roughly 28 to 37 gigawatts of renewables and storage projects. To put these numbers in context, this expected renewables and storage build at the midpoint is approximately 30% larger than the entire renewables operating portfolio at Energy Resources today. We were pleased that the Biden administration made the decision last month to direct the Department of Commerce to waive additional duties for two years on solar panels imported from Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam. The 24-month time frame is particularly important, as by the end of that period, we expect our suppliers to be making ingots and wafers outside of China. As a reminder, the Department of Commerce staff already publicly stated that panels with wafers made outside of China are not subject to its investigation. The actions by the Biden administration have provided much needed clarity to our suppliers to resume solar module production, recommence shipping of solar panels and for energy resources to restart its solar construction projects that have been halted due to the circumvention investigation. These new developments since our last call reinforce our confidence in both our near-term and long-term development expectations at Energy Resources. The accompanying slide provides additional details on where our development program at Energy Resources now stands. Beyond renewables and storage, during the quarter, NextEra Energy Water entered into an agreement to purchase a rate-regulated Pennsylvania wastewater system for approximately $115 million. Subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, we anticipate this transaction will close in mid 2023. Additionally, last week, NextEra Energy Water closed on its previously announced acquisition of a portfolio of rate-regulated water and wastewater utility assets in Texas. These strategic investments should allow us to leverage our world-class operating platform to unlock value for both customers and our shareholders as we explore potential opportunities in the regulated water utility business. At NextEra Energy Transmission, we commissioned the Empire State transmission line earlier this month. This project is an excellent complement to our existing operations and further expand NextEra Energy's regulated business mix through the addition of attractive rate-regulated assets to our portfolio. It is expected to improve system reliability and deliver much needed zero carbon emissions generation to New Yorkers, while supporting the state's goals to decarbonize its grid. So far, in 2022, NextEra Energy Transmission has completed roughly $500 million of greenfield transmission projects. The addition of high-quality transmission projects such as the East West Tie and the Empire State Transmission line furthers our strategy to be North America's leading competitive transmission provider, both to accretively deploy capital as well as to enable further renewables development. Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the second quarter of 2022, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $1.3 billion or $0.70 per share. NextEra Energy's 2022 second quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were roughly $1.6 billion and $0.81 per share, respectively. Adjusted results from the Corporate & Other segment decreased by $0.01 year-over-year. At our investor conference, we highlighted roughly $400 million in run rate efficiencies identified through project velocity that we expect to be recognized over the next few years. This represents the largest identified cost savings in the history of our company-wide productivity initiatives. In connection with project velocity during the second quarter, we recorded transition costs of approximately $52 million pre-tax, of which $40 million was recorded at FPL and offset with the utilization of reserve amortization. The balance was recorded at Energy Resources and reduced adjusted EPS by roughly $0.01 per share. Our long-term financial expectations through 2025, which we increased last month at our investor conference, remain unchanged. For 2022, NextEra Energy expects adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.80 to $2.90. For 2023 and 2024, NextEra Energy expects adjusted earnings per share to be in the ranges of $2.98 to $3.13 and $3.23 to $3.43, respectively. For 2025, we expect to grow 6% to 8% off the 2024 adjusted earnings per share range, which translates to a range of $3.45 to $3.70. We will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted earnings per share expectation ranges in 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025, while at the same time maintaining our strong balance sheet and credit ratings. Inclusive of the increases in our expectations in both January and June of this year, NextEra Energy's adjusted earnings per share expectations reflect a roughly 10% compound annual growth rate from 2021 to the high end of our range for 2025. Based upon the clear visibility into meaningful organic growth prospects across all of our businesses, we also remain confident in our near-term capital plan to deploy approximately $85 billion to $95 billion into new investments from 2022 through 2025. In addition, from 2021 to 2025, we continue to expect that our average annual growth and operating cash flow will be at or above our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. We also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at a roughly 10% rate per year through at least 2024 off a 2022 base. As always, our expectations assume normal weather and operating conditions. As a reminder, Energy Resources development expectations and NextEra Energy's financial expectations through 2025 do not assume any change in current tax law. We continue to see strong market demand for renewables, especially in light of the environment of high gas and power prices that we believe will persist going forward. Renewables are not just the most economic form of generation, they are deflationary and countercyclical. Renewable support energy independence, help stimulate economic growth, including domestic job creation. Renewables offer low-cost energy to help customers reduce their bills, and demand is being driven by a number of factors, as we discussed at our June Investor Conference. We continue to believe that NextEra Energy is better positioned than any other company in our industry to capitalize on these market conditions and deliver low-cost renewables and storage to our customers at both FPL and Energy Resources. Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners, which delivered outstanding operational and financial performance for the quarter. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution were up approximately 43% and 37%, respectively against the prior year comparable quarter. Yesterday, the NextEra Energy Partners Board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.7625 per common unit or $3.05 per common unit on an annualized basis, up approximately 15% from a year earlier. Inclusive of this increase, NextEra Energy Partners has now grown its distribution per unit by more than 300% since the IPO. Last month at our investor conference, NextEra Energy Partners announced a modification to incentive distribution rights fees, or IDRs, with NextEra Energy. The announced modification flattens IDR payments at $157 million annually based on a minimum annualized distribution rate of $3.05 per common unit. This modified IDR structure will be effective beginning in the third quarter of this year. We expect both NextEra Energy Partners' unitholders and NextEra Energy shareholders to benefit from the IDR modification. NextEra Energy Partners will need fewer asset additions to achieve its growth objectives with reduced equity needs, among other benefits. NextEra Energy expects to benefit from the potential increased value in its investment in NextEra Energy Partners while retaining an attractive incentive distribution fee stream as well as the ability to continue to recycle significant capital through Nexera Energy Partners. Putting it all together, these benefits are expected to provide a longer runway of LP distribution growth and support NextEra Energy Partners' best-in-class distribution per unit growth expectations that we extended last month. NextEra Energy Partners also completed multiple financings during the second quarter to further enhance its financing flexibility. In May, NextEra Energy Partners increased the size of its revolving credit facility by approximately $1.25 billion for a total of $2.5 billion in capacity, which is consistent with NextEra Energy Partners' growth since the facility was last upsized in 2019. The facility was approximately 1.6 times oversubscribed, which we believe demonstrates the strong credit quality of the NextEra Energy Partners portfolio as well as the market confidence in NextEra Energy Partners' growth outlook. Additionally, NextEra Energy Partners drew the approximately $410 million of remaining funds from its 2021 convertible equity portfolio financing. The strong demand for both the private investor and lending communities to provide NextEra Energy Partners with liquidity for growth demonstrates the Partnership's continued ability to raise capital at attractive terms. With another strong origination quarter at Energy Resources, NextEra Energy Partners' growth visibility is as strong as ever, and we remain on track to deliver on our best-in-class 12% to 15% annual distribution per unit growth expectations, which we extended through 2025 last month at our investor conference. Finally, last week, S&P favorably revised NextEra Energy Partners' business risk profile upward, from satisfactory to strong to reflect its positive outlook on the Partnership's continued growth and portfolio diversification while maintaining highly contracted revenue streams with highly rated counterparties. S&P also affirmed all of its ratings for NextEra Energy Partners and lowered his downgrade threshold for its funds from operations, or FFO, to debt metric from the previous level of 14% to the current level of 12%. We believe these favorable adjustments reflect the strength of NextEra Energy Partners business and a stable cash flow generation profile of its portfolio. Turning to the detailed results. NextEra Energy Partners' second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $500 million, and cash available for distribution was $207 million. New projects, which primarily reflect contributions from the approximately 2,400 net megawatts of new long-term contracted renewable projects acquired in 2021, contributed approximately $106 million of adjusted EBITDA and $41 million of cash available for distribution. Existing projects added roughly $51 million of adjusted EBITDA and $26 million of cash available for distribution in the second quarter, driven primarily by favorable wind resource. Wind resource for the second quarter of 2022 was approximately 112% of the long-term average versus 93% in the second quarter of 2021. Additional details of our second quarter results are shown on the accompanying slide. NextEra Energy Partners run rate adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution expectations for the forecasted portfolio at year-end 2022, which we increased last month at our investor conference, remain unchanged. NextEra Energy Partners continues to expect year-end 2022 run rate adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution in the ranges of $1.785 billion to $1.985 billion and $685 million to $775 million, respectively, reflecting calendar year 2023 contributions from the forecasted portfolio at the end of 2022. As a reminder, all of our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and include the impact of anticipated IDR fees as we treat fees as an operating expense. From a base of our fourth quarter 2021 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $2.83, we continue to see 12% to 15% growth per year and LP distributions per unit as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2025. We expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2022 distribution that is payable in February of 2023 to be in the range of $3.17 to $3.25 per common unit. Additional details of our long-term distribution per unit expectations are shown on the accompanying slide. In summary, we remain as enthusiastic as ever about the long [ph] growth prospects at both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. At FPL, that means continuing to deliver our best-in-class customer value proposition of low bills, high reliability and outstanding customer service. means pursuing our industry-leading real zero carbon emissions goal, which we detailed at our investor conference and in our zero-carbon blueprint to decarbonize FPL's operations by no later than 2045. At Energy Resources, we believe that our best-in-class development and operating platform will allow us to maintain our leadership position as we help both power and non-power sector customers save on energy costs and decarbonize operations with the adoption of new renewables and various forms of energy storage. And we expect NextEra Energy Partners to benefit greatly from the significant growth in renewables deployment across the United States, which presents terrific opportunities for acquisitions, both from Energy Resources and from third parties. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we will open the line for questions.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we’ll begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead with your question.
Steve Fleishman: Great. Thanks. I guess a couple of questions. Just a technical one on the new backlog additions. Could you give us some sense kind of what periods the 2 gigawatts were, is it mainly 2022, 2023 or 2024, 2025?
Kirk Crews: Sure. Good morning, Steve. Thank you. Thank you for the question. So in terms of the new additions that we announced this morning, the wind is sort of split evenly between 2023 and then the 2024 and 2025 time period. For solar, the majority of that is in the 2024 and 2025 time period.
Steve Fleishman: Great. Second question, I know that your plans do not include any BBB or any extension in tax credits at all, but would be curious of just your thoughts on chances for that to happen in tax extenders or kind of separately what the Biden administration might do on renewables with respect to just the executive actions and/or through the EPA?
John Ketchum: Sure, Steve. This is John. I'll go ahead and take that. Like you said, it's not included in our development or financial expectations. So if it happens, great. But our expectations through 2025, as Kirk said in the prepared remarks, assume current tax law. Our view is that renewables are going to continue to get cheaper and cheaper over time. Gas generation, which is what we primarily compete against for new renewables, on the other hand, continues to get more expensive. And we laid that case out, I think in detail at the June investor conference. And when I think about gas prices today, we think they're going to remain elevated over a long period of time. I just think there's a lot of headwinds that gas prices are facing today. One of them is obviously the lack of pipeline Infrastructure. We see significant demand for LNG export in Western Europe. There really is no gas to coal switching anymore, which used to put a cap on gas prices and would limit gas demand during scarcity events. So I think for all those reasons, we're going to continue to see upward pressure on gas prices. And that, when I look at our success this quarter at over 2 gigawatts, for customers, they're looking at that. They're looking at that, and they know that they have significant affordability issues that they are trying to address, and they're really trying to identify anything they can to hedge natural gas prices and natural gas price volatility in the bill. And so that is creating a ton of demand for renewables. And like I said, I don't see that really changing over time. I think we're going to be in a long-term period of heightened natural gas prices, which is really just terrific for renewables creates a ton of demand. On your questions on the views around what the options are for tax reform. First of all, I think reconciliation is somewhat unlikely, obviously, given the positions that have been taken over the last week or so. So our focus really is on extenders and more importantly, on executive actions. So let me take those in order. The first on extenders. Extenders could happen. But there are things on both sides of the aisle that they will want at the end of the year. I mean, you think about the things that are important to Republicans, and I think Senator Grassley put a statement out a couple of days ago saying that all 25 or 26 extenders hinge on the full R&D expense deduction, that is going to be something that's going to be front and center, I think on the Republican wish list, is getting that done, because I think as most folks know that R&D full expensing was eliminated at the end of 2021, and it gets amortized now over five years. So they want to see that extended. We have the interest-deductibility limitation, which converts from EBITDA to EBIT. And at the end of 2022, bonus depreciation starts to scale down. Those are all things that could really drive economic growth. And I think we'll be high on the list in things that we may be able to trade for an extension on renewable credits. So while we're not counting on it, we will continue to do everything we can around extenders to try to support extension of tax credits for renewables. I think executive action, particularly given the statements that were made by the President at the end of last week, there are definitely some things that we can do there. We will continue to work it. We have a number of ideas on our list that we are pursuing at different levels. And I'd like to just leave it at that on the executive branch activity, but feel somewhat optimistic about our ability to get some exciting things done there.
Steve Fleishman: Okay, great. I’ll let other ask questions. Thank you.
John Ketchum: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey good morning team. Thanks for the time. Maybe just a follow-up from Steve's last question. Focus here on origination, new record in the second quarter here. How are you thinking about the back half of the year? Clearly, to a certain extent, you would think that there would be some hesitancy from customers given the uncertainty on BBB. Considering that maybe those expectations have withered at this point, does that actually mean customers are now in gear to make moves? And could we actually see a further acceleration of origination in the back half of the year, if you follow what I'm saying?
Rebecca Kujawa: Julien, it's Rebecca. I'll take that question. The team is doing a terrific job with ongoing conversations with customers. But as we've highlighted, really since for a very long period of time and consistently even since the start of the year when we've been talking a lot more about disruption across the industry. Interest from customers remains really robust. And that was throughout even the uncertainty around circumvention at the height of it, even around solar. And it really goes back to the heart of what Kirk said in the prepared remarks and what John just commented on a minute or two ago in response to one of Steve's questions, our customers are acutely aware of the value of renewables in their portfolio from an economic standpoint, both in the pure sense of being low cost, but also in the sense of being a terrific offset to inflationary concerns about other forms of generation in their portfolio. And then on top of that they have various commitments that they've talked to, to their own stakeholders about deploying renewables and reducing carbon in their portfolio. So, I think there's this underlying current of demand that has been far less affected than you might think by the headlines in our conversations about what's going on in the industry. So, I would say, the fundamentals are terrific. And as you can see from our origination, I always caution you all not to look at a single quarter in isolation to keep looking at multiple quarters over time. And you can see really strong demand for both wind and solar and battery storage throughout the portfolio. So, I'm thrilled with our conversations with our customers, I'm thrilled with the execution of the team and remain as excited as I've ever been about the prospects for us continuing to execute and delivering new renewables.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes, it sounds more consistent, as you say. And then just -- this might seem more of a check the box, but just to clarify this, I mean, we've seen some concerns out there on core site of late and just USLPA, et cetera. I mean I know there's some concerns and perhaps this is more of a review process as a few things are held up here. But I just want to turn back to your prepared comments, et cetera. It sounds like this is not substantively concerned for you guys, at least per your own contracting activities in a way.
Rebecca Kujawa: Julien, we continue to work through supply chain. Of course, you know all the headlines as well as anybody on circumvention. For WRO and the Weaker Force Labor Protection Act, obviously, we have for WRO some history already under our belt for us and for the industry and for the flip implementing regulations. We now have some time in place for those and our conversations with our suppliers remain really constructive. So, we're going to constantly be vigilant as our suppliers, but we continue to see a constructive path forward on being able to put projects in service over time.
John Ketchum: Yes. And the only thing that I would add to what Rebecca just said, Julien, is none of our suppliers are on the import panelist. None of our panels have been detained. I think as Rebecca said, the process that will be followed will be much like the WRO which our suppliers are well-versed in dealing with. And there will be a little bit of due diligence on, hey, where do these panels come from? What's the traceability, just like we've seen with WRO? But we believe it's all very manageable.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Okay, excellent. I'll leave it there. Thanks guys.
Operator: And our next question comes from Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead with your question.
Shar Pourreza: Hey, good morning guys.
John Ketchum: Good morning Shar.
Shar Pourreza: Just what's the threshold for removing the language around the 2 gigawatts of projects that you noted in the footnotes that could still be at risk? I mean, can you maybe just elaborate on how the discussions are going with customers? And just given that you've been in discussions for some time, where are you sort of trending as we're thinking about the 1 to 2 gigawatt cancellation range that you sort of highlighted at the Analyst Day. I mean, could we end up with no cancellations. I guess when can we get an update there?
Rebecca Kujawa: Hey Shar, so it's Rebecca, I'll take that question as well. Our conversations, I would say are across the board very constructive and I think throughout this process, we've been very transparent, obviously, with you all and our conversations that we highlighted at the investor conference, but at least as importantly and perhaps more so from my perspective, very transparent and honest with our customers. And it continues to be a process, particularly for the things we just talked about, both for getting back on track from the disruption related to the circumvention investigation and also understanding the implications of WRO and flip as well as understanding our customers' requirements for what is most important to them in terms of of timing and getting their projects in service. I would say, I'm very pleased with the progress on those conversations. I'm optimistic. I think I even said this at the investor conference, there's still a path where there is little to no cancellations across the board. We're not there yet. There's still some ongoing dialogue that we need to have. But irrespective of that, I feel very comfortable with the development expectations that we've laid out that even if there's some disruption with a couple of those contracts, I feel very confident in being able to enter into other contracts and continue the development of other projects such that those ranges that we've provided to you and, of course, gave you again today, remain very much in reach. And our origination for this quarter speaks for itself of being able to continue meaningful progress towards winning those up and creating terrific visibility to where we just need to execute.
Shar Pourreza: Got it. Got it. So just -- sorry, if I could just, it sounds like the way the discussions are going, there could be a situation where you see no cancellations.
Rebecca Kujawa: That's certainly possible. But again, most importantly, even if there's some disruption, I also feel really good about being able to have alternatives in place. So I think it's both yes and.
Shar Pourreza: Got it. Got it. And just wanted to follow up on the transaction value of renewable projects, especially as you're kind of looking at the rising interest rate environment. Do sort of the rising rates present a challenge to monetize projects both through net or third parties? And how do you see the interest rates impacting sort of the economics of the project, the development margins, the IRRs? So is there sort of pricing flexibility to pass those costs without seeing sort of that elasticity in demand?
John Ketchum: So Shar, let me start with, as we've often talked about, we have a number of competitive advantages when it comes to financing the projects. But I think you also need to consider the environment in which we are contracting renewable projects right now. And as John talked about, what the alternative is for the customer. So given the high gas price environment, it certainly provides room for us to have a higher PPA price. And that gives us the ability to offset higher interest rate costs and still maintain our margins. With respect to NextEra Energy Partners as we've shared before, again, a lot of financing options available at NextEra Energy Partners. We've demonstrated over the years, ways to finance the growth in a very cost-efficient way. And we continue to believe that we can utilize all the different financing options that we have to continue to support the growth at NextEra Energy Partners.
Shar Pourreza: Terrific. Thanks, guys. I’ll pass it to someone else. Congrats, John and team. Appreciate it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Durgesh Chopra from Evercore. Please go ahead with your question.
Durgesh Chopra: Hey, good morning, team. Thank you for taking my question. All my other questions have been answered. I wanted to go to sort of your water and wastewater strategy, and I appreciate it's small part of your business. But maybe just a two-part question there. One, can you talk about your outlook there? Obviously, the Texas deal is now closed and you made a key announcement where you talked about the PA wastewater system on the call today. So, can you discuss your outlook there? Do you see a lot of opportunity to grow there? That's part one. And then part two, how should we think about competition? Here, I'm referring to the local water utilities as you approach these deals. And what's your competitive advantage? Thank you.
Rebecca Kujawa: Yes. Thanks for the question. I'll take that. It's obviously, Rebecca. We're very excited about it. As we've talked now a number of quarters, we see a lot of synergies from the competitive strengths that we bring to the table, our size, our approach to being able to focus on cost and on innovation and all of the -- both supply chain and execution that we can bring to the water business. And of course, we find regulated earnings and cash flows very attractive. So there's lots of both structural and strategic reasons why we're interested and we're thrilled with the progress that we've had so far, getting some initial work done in both Texas and Pennsylvania. And I feel really energized by what the team is looking at in terms of opportunities for growth going forward and building more of a platform opportunity. And I think it's key to think about some of the value this brings. There are local utilities out in these communities, and we can help them solve some of the challenges that they see, both the municipals and the entities that run those businesses. So, I think it's terrific. I do want to caveat that relative to the size of our overall business and the capital investments that we're making, it's relatively small. But in all of our broader conversations and investments in renewables and talking to these municipal entities around renewables, there's often opportunities to also bring value to them on the water side and other parts of infrastructure that is meaningful to them. So terrific synergies. I'm really excited about the outlook. We continue to be much more of a renewable company than necessarily a straight water company, but I'm really happy with the progress we've made so far.
Durgesh Chopra: Thank you. I appreciate your time. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.
Jeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning.
John Ketchum: Hi, good morning, Jeremy.
Jeremy Tonet: Just wanted to pick up maybe with M&A a little bit here. And how does the recently instated real zero goal impact your prospects around M&A going forward? And when you're looking at assets, is there more of an interest on water, as you talked about here? Or how is the appetite varied between water, electric gas?
John Ketchum: Sure. So look, I think we've -- as we've discussed before on M&A, we are really excited about the organic growth opportunities we have at both FPL and Energy Resources. At FPL, it is a growing population here in the state, at Energy Resources, it's a fantastic renewable environment. So, as we think about M&A, we will always look, we're always interested, but we're really focused on the organic growth opportunities. And I think Rebecca shared with you sort of the thinking we have around water and whether or not there are opportunities there in water that we can help local municipalities. But in the context of the overall business and the organic growth that we have at both FPL and Energy Resources, it's still a small opportunity set.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. Thanks for that. And then maybe just coming back to supply chain a little bit more at high-level question. What do you think about the prospects regarding domestic manufacturing? What are your expectations for US market share multiple years down the road? What percentage of panels do you think could be domestically sourced today versus five years in the future?
John Ketchum: This is John. I'll go ahead and take that. I mean, what you're going to continue to see is, I think, really more of an intense focus on what's possible in the US. I mean, I think you've certainly seen our company take a leadership position early on with what we were able to do up in Jacksonville around a panel manufacturing facility. We will continue to look for more opportunities going forward. But I think it's going to be important that we have a diverse approach that looks hard at domestic production opportunities and supporting domestic production opportunities going forward. It's hard to really give you a percentage, but I think you're going to see this industry really focused on ways that we can help create more domestic jobs here on the home front. That's one of the great things about renewables. I mean, renewables are energy independent from a national security standpoint. They’re all within the boundaries of the US and we will continue to focus on developing projects that are fuel independent as well, which will, as I said before, really help, I think, in taking a bite out of the bill in a high natural gas price environment.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. Thank you for taking my question.
Operator: Our next question comes from Stephen Byrd from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.
Dave Arcaro: Hi. It's Dave Arcaro on for Stephen. Thanks so much for taking my question. So I was wondering, just looking at the Energy Resources development outlook, there is a big ramp in solar from the 2022, 2023 period into the 2024, 2025 period. I was wondering, is there an opportunity or any effort to kind of pull forward projects from 2024, 2025 into 2023. Kind of curious how generally 2023 is shaping up in terms of industry growth that year?
Rebecca Kujawa: Dave, its Rebecca. I'll take that. One, as we just think about it from our company's perspective, obviously, we have financial expectations built around the ranges that we've already provided, which anticipates both at 2022, 2023 time frame and 2024, 2025 time frame of in-service. But certainly, as we look out to 2025 and think about that being a substantial solar build year, for us and for the industry for obvious reasons, assuming that there's no change to current tax policy, of course, we're going to think long and hard about how do you optimize that growth. We're already in conversations with our EPC contracts, our labor contracts as well as the physical supply chain needed in order to support that build to ensure that we're on top of it and tracking it accordingly. This is kind of what we do, right? It's -- in our industry, as you all know, there's a history of peaks as you go into a year in which the industry expects to have a change in incentives after that year. So we will prepare for it. I feel very comfortable with where we are today, that we've got the right systems thoughts and execution in place to be successful. But, of course, as you highlighted, we'll look at every possible way to optimize that.
Dave Arcaro: Okay. Got it. Thanks. That's helpful. And then, on Florida, I was wondering if you could talk about bill inflation and just approaches that you're pursuing to manage the pressure that we're seeing on customer builds this year? Anything new in the works or creative ways to help spread that cost out or that bill inflation now?
Eric Silagy: Hi Dave, this is Eric Silagy. I'll take that. So look, first off, we continue to be focused on being as efficient as possible. One of the advantages that we have is we have the most fuel-efficient fleet in Florida as well as among the country. But also our solar focus and our big solar build help as well because, frankly, we just burn left gas. So when you look at how much electricity megawatt hours we actually produce every day and look at the non-fuel, we burn, the efficiency is the best way for us to save customers. As Kirk said in his opening remarks, you look at how many billions of dollars that we've actually save customers over the years by simply not charging them for fuel that we simply didn't have to buy. So that remains a key focus for us along with our productivity and our O&M. I'm proud of the continued focus across the entire organization. We have the lowest O&M per kilowatt hour of any utility in America, and we're not satisfied with that. So we're going to continue to do that. So we're tightening our belts to do everything we can to make sure our customer bills remain the lowest among all the IOUs in Florida and among the lowest in the country.
Dave Arcaro: Got it. Thanks so much.
Operator: And our next question comes from James Thalacker from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.
James Thalacker: Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my call.
John Ketchum: Good morning.
James Thalacker: Just a real quick question. Obviously, existing generation of storage and customer supply had a good quarter, quarter-over-quarter. I know obviously some of that was related to the above average wind resource, which rebounded quite a bit. But just wondering, post-Uri, a lot of the generators had restructured some of their contracts. Did you guys see any benefits in 2Q from any sort of maybe changing in your hedging strategy? And could that be something we could see flowing through through the rest of the year?
John Ketchum: Yes, sure. So we did not really have any change to the way that we operated our book. Obviously, winter storm Uri was an event where I think everyone who operated in Texas learn some information in terms of the way to position their books. And we certainly have positioned our book to help better manage extreme conditions, both in the winter and the summer, but we did not have any significant changes to the way that we run the business in Texas as a result.
James Thalacker: Okay, great. Thanks so much.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, with that, we'll be ending today's question-and-answer session as well as today's conference call. We do thank everyone for joining today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-04-21 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and welcome to the NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners First Quarter Earnings call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator instructions] After today's presentation, there will be opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jessica Jeffery [ph], Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Company Representative: Thank you, Anthony. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our first quarter 2022 combined earnings conference call for NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. With me this morning are John Ketchum, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; Kirk Crews, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; Rebecca Kujawa, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources; and Mark Hickson, Executive Vice President of NextEra Energy. All of whom are also officers of NextEra Energy Partners, as well as Eric Silagy, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power and Light Company. Kirk will provide an overview of our results and our executive team will then be available to answer your questions. We will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call in the risk factor section of the accompanying presentation or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found on our websites, nexteraenergy.com and nexteraenergypartners.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. Today's presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of historical non-GAAP measures to the closest GAAP financial measure. As a reminder, Florida Power and Light completed the regulatory integration of Gulf Power under its 2021 base rate settlement agreement and began serving customers under unified rates on January 1, 2022. As a result, Gulf Power will no longer continue as a separate reporting segment within Florida Power and Light and NextEra Energy. For 2022 and beyond, FPL has one reporting segment and, therefore, 2021 financial results and other operational metrics have been restated for comparative purposes. With that, I will turn the call over to Kirk.
Kirk Crews: Thank you, Jessica, and good morning everyone. NextEra Energy delivered strong first quarter results and is off to a solid start to meet its overall objectives for the year. Adjusted earnings per share increased by 10.4% year-over-year, reflecting successful performance across all of our underlying businesses. During the quarter, we were honored that NextEra Energy was again ranked number one in its sector of Fortune Magazine's world's most admired companies list for the 15th time in 16 years. Our culture of commitment to excellence in everything we do and our core values are what allow our team of approximately 15,000 employees to continue delivering best-in-class value to our customers and shareholders while helping build a sustainable energy era that is affordable and clean. FPL increased net income by approximately $98 million from the prior year comparable period, which was driven by continued investment in the business for the benefit of our customers. During the quarter, FPL successfully placed in-service, approximately 450 megawatts of additional cost-effective solar projects that are recovered through base rates as part of its new four year settlement agreement, which as a reminder became effective on January 1st of this year. As a result, FPL has now completed on time and within budget all of its planned solar build with 2022 in service dates. FPL now owns and operates more than 3,600 megawatts of solar, which is the largest solar portfolio of any utility in the country. FPL's modernization investments since 2001 have saved customers more than $12 billion in fuel costs and its customers have benefited from a 45% improvement in reliability over the last decade. FPL's other major capital investments are progressing well, including the North Florida Resiliency Connection and the highly efficient approximately 1,200 megawatts Dania Beach Clean Energy Center, both of which are scheduled for completion later this year. By executing on smart capital investments such as these and running the business efficiently, FPL continues to deliver its best-in-class customer value proposition of clean energy, low bills, high reliability and outstanding customer service. At Energy Resources, adjusted earnings per share increased by nearly 7% year-over-year, primarily driven by favorable performance in our existing wind portfolio. In terms of new origination, Energy Resources had another strong quarter of renewables and storage origination adding approximately 1,770 net megawatts to our backlog since the last call bringing our backlog total to approximately 17,700 megawatts. Included in the additions this quarter is approximately 1,200 net megawatts of wind projects, which is the second largest quarter of wind origination in our history. In the midst of inflationary pressures and uncertainty in solar supply chain, which I will discuss further in a few moments, our continued origination success in this environment is a testament to the strength of Energy Resources' competitive advantages and the ongoing demand from our customers for low cost renewals and storage. At this early point in the year, we are very pleased with our team's execution and progress at both FPL and Energy Resources. Now let's look at the detailed results beginning with FPL. For the first quarter of 2022, FPL reported net income of $875 million, or $0.44 per share, an increase of $0.05 year-over-year. Regulatory capital employed growth of approximately 11.3% was a significant driver of FPL's EPS growth versus the prior year comparable quarter. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $2.2 billion for the quarter. We expect our full year 2022 capital investments at FPL to be between $7.9 billion and $8.3 billion. FPL's reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.6% for the 12 months ending March 2022. Under our rate agreement, we record reserve amortization entries to achieve a predetermined regulatory ROE for each trailing 12 month period. In this case, the 11.6% that I previously mentioned. While we initially expected to earn below our targeted ROE in the early part of 2022, a combination of warm weather, operational efficiencies and outstanding execution by the team resulted in us achieving our targeted 11.6% ROE while using $124 million of reserve amortization available under our current settlement agreement during the first quarter. Turning to our development and planning efforts, FPL recently filed its Annual Ten-Year Site Plan that presents our recommended generation resource plan through 2031. The recommended Ten-Year Site Plan includes roughly 9,500 megawatts of new solar capacity across our service territory over the next ten years, which would result in nearly 20% of FPL's forecasted energy delivery in 2031 coming from solar generation. This planned solar build-out includes nearly 1,200 megawatts of base rate solar projects inclusive of the approximately 450 megawatts placed in service during the first quarter that we plan to build over the next two years. In addition, it includes approximately 1,800 megawatts under the SoBRA mechanism of our settlement agreement, approximately 1,800 megawatts of SolarTogether community solar projects that we expect to construct over the next four years, as well as roughly 4,700 megawatts of additional solar after 2025, that is subject to approval by the Florida Public Service Commission. FPL continues to deliver what is one of the largest-ever solar expansions in the U.S. Compared to current levels, the recommended plan projects an approximately 65% increase in zero-carbon-emissions electricity produced by the FPL system over the next decade, largely as a result of FPL’s continued rapid expansion of solar energy through the execution of its 30-by-30 plan, which we now expect to complete by 2025, and the solar additions that I previously mentioned. This projected increase in zero carbon-emissions generation is significant for a utility system of our size, especially when considering that our total amount of energy delivered in 2031 is expected to be nearly 10 percentage points higher through customer growth and increased adoption of electric vehicles. Our green hydrogen pilot program plans are also reiterated in the site plan. As we’ve previously discussed, we intend to build an approximately 25-megawatt electrolysis system at our Okeechobee Clean Energy Center that will be powered entirely by solar energy from a nearby site. The pilot is designed to test, in practice, the concept of replacing natural gas with green hydrogen as fuel for combined cycle unit use. The pilot project is expected to guide the way for future use of hydrogen as a fuel source across FPL’s fleet of highly efficient combined cycle units, thus lowering or eliminating carbon emissions from FPL’s fleet in the future. This pilot project is projected to go into service in late 2023. Notably, our as-filed 10-year site plan recommends a total expected deployment of approximately 3,200 megawatts of new battery storage capacity by 2031. Included in this total is approximately 1,400 megawatts of incremental battery storage to enhance readiness and reliability for our customers during potential extreme weather events. We also plan to make other smart capital investments for winterization efforts designed to support potential increased customer load during extreme winter temperature conditions, while also providing additional day-to-day reliability benefits for customers. A hallmark of our culture is taking every opportunity to learn from events that happen in our industry, not just those that directly affect FPL, to ensure we continue to deliver the best possible value to our customers. Our planned targeted investments for winterization were identified as a result of our detailed assessment of our fleet following Winter Storm Uri last year that affected Texas and much of the South. We will provide additional detail on these programs and our other capital initiatives at our June investor conference. The Florida economy remains healthy and Florida’s population continues to grow at one of the fastest rates in the U.S. Florida’s job market continues to show healthy results, with more than 700,000 new private sector jobs added over the last year, and Florida’s labor force participation rate is up nearly 2% year-over-year. Other positive economic data across the state include the continued strength of Florida’s real estate market, with the three-month moving average for new housing permits up nearly 20% year-over-year. FPL’s average number of customers increased by more than 91,000, or 1.6%, versus the comparable prior-year quarter, driven by continued solid underlying population growth. FPL’s first quarter retail sales increased 2.6% from the prior-year comparable period, and we estimate that approximately 0.7% of this increase can be attributed to weather-related usage per customer. On a weather-normalized basis, first quarter retail sales increased 1.9%, with strong continued customer growth contributing favorably. Energy Resources reported a first quarter 2022 GAAP loss of approximately $1.5 billion, or $0.76 per share. Adjusted earnings for the first quarter were $628 million, or $0.32 per share, up $0.02 versus the prior-year comparable period. The effect of the mark-to-market on nonqualifying hedges, which is excluded from adjusted earnings, was the primary driver of the difference between Energy Resources’ first quarter GAAP and adjusted earnings results. As a reminder, this quarter’s GAAP results were also impacted by the write-off of our remaining investment in Mountain Valley Pipeline, which we have excluded from adjusted earnings. Contributions from new investments were roughly flat year-over-year, while our existing generation and storage assets added $0.05 per share due to favorable wind resource and the absence of Winter Storm Uri impacts. The contribution from our customer supply and trading business decreased by $0.02 per share and NextEra Energy Transmission increased results by $0.01 per share year-over-year. The comparative contribution from our gas infrastructure business decreased results by $0.02 per share following favorable performance in the first quarter of last year during Winter Storm Uri. All other impacts were roughly flat versus 2021. As I mentioned earlier, Energy Resources had another strong quarter of origination, which is reflective of our ability to continue leveraging our competitive advantages to deliver clean energy solutions to meet the ongoing market demand for renewables. Since the last call, we added approximately 1,200 net megawatts of new wind projects for 2022, 2023 and 2024 commercial operations dates to our backlog. Our backlog additions also include approximately 440 megawatts of solar projects and approximately 130 megawatts of battery storage projects. With more than 2.5 years remaining before the end of 2024, we have now signed more than 85% of the megawatts needed to realize the midpoint of our 2021 to 2024 development expectations range. Earlier this month, the U.S. Department of Commerce initiated a review of an anti-dumping and countervailing duties circumvention claim on solar cells and panels supplied from four Southeast Asian countries, which in recent years sourced over 80% of all solar panel imports into the United States. As we recently highlighted, we are disappointed by the Commerce Department’s decision to conduct this investigation. We believe the Commerce Department already settled this issue when it concluded in 2012 that the process of converting solar wafers into electricity-producing solar cells is technologically sophisticated and the most capital intensive part of the solar panel manufacturing process, and when that occurs outside of China, the cells are not subject to the 2012 anti-dumping and countervailing duties applicable to Chinese solar cell imports. The Commerce Department’s later rulings in 2014, 2020 and 2021 are consistent with this and have been relied upon by the solar industry as it continued to invest billions of dollars in new solar generating facilities in the United States over this period. In light of these four prior rulings, the reliance on them by the industry and the substantial, technologically sophisticated processing that occurs in the Southeast Asian countries, we believe it will be difficult for the Commerce Department to conclude under its circumvention standards that circumvention of the 2012 tariffs is actually occurring. If the Commerce Department were to find circumvention in the current investigation, we believe it would be unwinding a decade of consistent trade practice across the past three administrations, including the current administration just last year. We believe such a decision would create significant price uncertainty as additional tariffs on panels from the four Southeast Asian countries would likely remain unknown until close to 2025, as final tariff amounts are not determined for about two years after the year of importation. This price uncertainty would likely result in the unintended consequence of U.S. solar panel supply once again being sourced significantly from China, because the tariffs applicable to imports from China are more certain based on 10 years of assessed duty history. U.S. solar panel assemblers are, for the most part, sold out of solar panels through 2024 and, even at full capacity, are only capable of serving 10% to 20% of the U.S. solar panel demand in the first place. It should also be noted that nearly all of the large domestic solar panel assemblers in the U.S. do not support the efforts behind the circumvention claim or the Commerce Department’s decision to investigate, as they also primarily rely on imported cells from Southeast Asia to produce their panels in the United States. And all of the uncertainty from the investigation is occurring at a time when natural gas, coal and oil prices have increased dramatically, leaving solar and storage as one of the few ways to alleviate inflationary pressures on electricity prices. For these reasons, among others, we are optimistic that the investigation will ultimately be resolved favorably and the Commerce Department will conclude not to impose additional anti-dumping and countervailing duties on cells and panels sourced from these Southeast Asian countries. We believe that NextEra Energy is as well positioned as any company in the industry to manage these issues. However, given that a number of suppliers are not expected to ship panels to the U.S. until the Commerce Department makes a preliminary determination as late as August, we continue to expect some of our solar and storage projects may be adversely impacted by this delay. We are working closely with our suppliers and customers to assess the potential impacts of this investigation and are optimistic about our ability to arrive at acceptable mitigation measures. Based on what we know today, we believe that approximately 2.1 gigawatts to 2.8 gigawatts of our expected 2022 solar and storage build may shift from 2022 to 2023. Despite the delay, given our competitive advantages, including the strength of our supplier relationships and contracts, we remain comfortable with our current development expectations for wind, solar and storage, which are to build roughly 23 gigawatts to 30 gigawatts over the four-year period from 2021 through the end of 2024. We run a diversified business at Energy Resources that includes multiple renewable energy technologies and provides a natural hedge against temporary disruptions like the one our industry is currently experiencing. In fact, in light of the uncertainty in the solar supply chain, we believe renewable demand will likely temporarily shift in part from solar to wind, and we believe Energy Resources has terrific competitive advantages in wind development. The accompanying slide provides additional details. Finally, during the quarter NextEra Energy Transmission, along with its partners, completed the construction of the East-West Tie Transmission Line Project. The 450-kilometer, 230-kilovolt transmission line runs from Wawa to Thunder Bay, Ontario and is expected to address long-standing regional transmission constraints, thereby increasing much-needed access to energy to support new economic growth in the region for years to come. Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy, for the first quarter of 2022, GAAP net losses attributable to NextEra Energy were $415 [ph] million, or $0.23 per share. NextEra Energy’s 2022 first quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were approximately $1.46 billion and $0.74 per share, respectively. Adjusted earnings from the Corporate & Other segment were roughly flat year-over-year. Our long-term financial expectations, which we increased and extended earlier this year through 2025 remain unchanged. For 2022, NextEra Energy expects adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.75 to $2.85. For 2023 through 2025, NextEra Energy expects to grow roughly 6% to 8% off the expected 2022 adjusted earnings per share range. NextEra Energy is in a strong position to meet its financial expectations through 2025, and we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted earnings expectations ranges in each of 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025, while at the same time maintaining our strong balance sheet and credit ratings. A big part of NextEra Energy’s culture is a focus on continuous improvement and productivity. To that end, we are currently wrapping up our company-wide productivity initiative to reimagine everything that we do, which we call Project Velocity. Project Velocity built upon the success of Project Momentum and Project Accelerate, which were launched in 2013 and 2017, respectively. The employee-generated ideas implemented through Project Momentum and Project Accelerate are projected to deliver more than $1.8 billion in average annual run-rate savings first, our cost projections just 10 years ago. In fact, the ideas generated this year in Project Velocity alone are expected to reach roughly $400 million in additional run-rate efficiencies in the next few years, representing the largest identified O&M cost savings in the history of these programs. This result is another example of the strength of our culture and team and highlights our continued focus on productivity and our team’s willingness to embrace innovation and leverage technology. From 2021 to 2025, we also continue to expect that our average annual growth in operating cash flow will be at or above our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. We also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at roughly 10% per year through at least 2024, off a 2022 base. As always, our expectations assume normal weather and operating conditions. Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners, which delivered solid first quarter results, with year-over-year growth in adjusted EBITDA of more than 16% driven primarily by contributions from the approximately 2,400 net megawatts of renewables and storage added during 2021. Yesterday, the NEP Board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.7325 per common unit, or $2.93 per common unit on an annualized basis, up approximately 15% from a year earlier. Inclusive of this increase, NextEra Energy Partners has grown its LP distributions per unit by more than 290% since the IPO. Further building upon that strength, NextEra Energy Partners today is announcing that it has entered into an agreement with Energy Resources to acquire an approximately 67% interest in an approximately 230-megawatt, four-hour battery storage facility in California that is fully contracted with an investment grade counterparty for 15 years. The acquisition will further diversify NextEra Energy Partners’ existing portfolio with the addition of another battery storage project and is an excellent complement to NextEra Energy Partners’ existing operations. NextEra Energy Partners expects to acquire the project interest for approximately $191 million, subject to closing adjustments, which is expected to be funded with existing debt capacity. NextEra Energy Partners’ share of the asset’s tax equity financing is estimated to be approximately $80 million at the time of closing. The acquisition is expected to contribute adjusted EBITDA of approximately $30 million to $35 million and cash available for distribution of approximately $13 million to $18 million, each on a five-year average annual run-rate basis beginning December 31, 2022. The transaction is expected to close later this year, upon the project reaching its commercial operations date, and supports NextEra Energy Partners’ projected adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution growth in 2022. Finally, NextEra Energy Partners recently closed on a transaction to sell an approximately 156-mile gas pipeline from its existing portfolio for a total consideration of approximately $203 million to a third party. The sale price of the pipeline represents an attractive and accretive EBITDA multiple and further enhances the renewable energy profile of NextEra Energy Partners. We are pleased with this transaction and look forward to redeploying the proceeds into accretive renewable energy assets, like the battery storage acquisition from Energy Resources that I just mentioned, to support NextEra Energy Partners’ long-term distribution growth expectations. Turning to the detailed results, NextEra Energy Partners’ first quarter adjusted EBITDA was $412 million and cash available for distribution was $169 million. New projects, which primarily reflect the asset acquisitions that closed in the second half of 2021, contributed approximately $75 million of adjusted EBITDA and $25 million of cash available for distribution. The adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution contribution existing projects declined $9 million and $29 million respectively, versus the prior year comparable quarter. Favorable performance at existing projects drove an increase in adjusted EBITDA contributions of approximately $46 million year-over-year, which was more than offset by the absence of approximately $55 million in benefits realized during the last February's Winter Storm Uri. Excluding the positive impact of Winter Storm Uri from last year's first quarter results, this quarter's adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution were up nearly 38% and 31%, respectively, year-over-year. Cash available for distribution was also impacted by the timing of PAYGO payments. Wind resource for the first quarter of 2022 was 108% of the long-term average versus 98% in the first quarter of 2021. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide. NextEra Energy Partners continues to expect run rate contributions for adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution from its forecasted portfolio at December 31, 2022, to be in the ranges of $1.775 billion to $1.975 billion and $675 million to $765 million, respectively. As a reminder, year-end 2022 run rate projections reflect calendar year 2023 contributions from the forecasted portfolio at year-end 2022 and include the impact of IDR fees, which we treat as an operating expense. As always, our expectations are subject to our usual caveats, including normal weather and operating conditions. From a base of our fourth quarter 2021 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $2.83, we continue to see 12% to 15% growth per year in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2024. We do not expect the recent solar supply chain disruption to impact our ability to deliver on these expectations. We expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2022 distribution that is payable in February of 2023 to be in a range of $3.17 to $3.25 per common unit. We also continue to expect to achieve our 2022 distribution growth of 12% to 15% while maintaining a trailing 12-month payout ratio in the low-80% range. In summary, both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners are benefiting from our history of strong execution that has positioned us well to capitalize on the terrific growth opportunities available to us across our businesses. We look forward to sharing more detail with you on our growth plans for both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners at our investor conference in New York on June 14. Before taking your questions, I'd like to turn the call over to John Ketchum.
John Ketchum: Thank you, Kirk, and good morning, everyone. I am excited for the opportunity to talk to you in my new role. Since we announced our planned leadership succession in January, we have heard from many of our shareholders and industry analysts. Several of you have asked whether you should expect any changes in strategy under a new CEO. The short answer is that I expect our strategy to be consistent with how we have grown the company over the past several decades, but that we will continue to adapt and evolve our strategy to meet increasing customer expectations, to leverage new technologies and to lead the decarbonization of the U.S. economy. Now is the time for our company, our industry and our country to embrace low-cost renewable energy like never before. We need to create more jobs, not less, and combat the impacts of higher inflation, higher oil and natural gas prices and rising electricity demand by supporting, not stymying, solar and storage development. Our strategy going forward is to build down on our core businesses. At FPL, we expect one of the highest population growth rates of any state in the nation to continue. In fact, at our current rate of organic customer growth, FPL would add a customer base the size of Gulf Power roughly every five years. FPL's undergrounding program is just getting started, and we have visibility to billions of dollars in capital investment for the next several decades to continue hardening and strengthening the grid as we deliver industry-leading reliability to our customers. And we are also just getting started at decarbonizing the generation fleet at FPL as only about 5% of our generation in FPL is currently produced by renewable energy. I believe that FPL already is the best utility in the nation. And yet we see significant cost reduction and incremental capital investment opportunities at FPL over the next several decades that can further improve our industry-leading customer value proposition by delivering clean, low-cost energy solutions for Florida customers. Our strategy also entails doubling down on our core at Energy Resources. We intend to build more wind, more solar and more battery stores than anybody else in this country year in and year out regardless of the headwinds or tailwinds in any given year. We believe that we have the competitive advantages to win under any market conditions. And with recent technological advancements in green hydrogen and other forms of long-term storage, we see a total addressable market in this country for renewables, storage and transmission of around $8 trillion through 2050. We have said this before, and we believe it is never more true than it is today: the opportunity set for renewable energy in this country continues to expand rapidly, and we believe Energy Resources is in a terrific position for continued industry leadership and for long-term growth for shareholders. Both FPL and Energy Resources have multiple ways to grow, and each business continues to push the other to be even better. As FPL grows, both businesses learn what drives customer value in Florida. As Energy Resources grows, both businesses learn what drives customer value in other markets across the country. Operational excellence is a competitive advantage for us across both businesses, so as development and construction expertise, so as supply chain management, so as financial discipline. Both businesses are constantly implementing new technologies. Both businesses are constantly finding ways to do things more efficiently and to improve our cost position. As Kirk mentioned, this year, our employees generated about 900 individual ideas translating into roughly $400 million in additional run rate O&M savings across the enterprise through Project Velocity, our best performance ever after 10 years of pursuing O&M improvement in this employee-driven annual exercise. Our strategy at NextEra Energy is to continue to do what we have done well, only better and bigger as new market opportunities present themselves. Our strategy at NextEra Energy Partners is much the same. The partnership will double down on what we have done well since our IPO in 2014. We expect to continue delivering LP distribution growth that is already best-in-class. We plan to continue to pursue growth in three ways: by acquiring assets from Energy Resources, by acquiring assets from third parties and by additional organic capital investments in the assets we own as the portfolio grows over time. Yet as at NextEra Energy, it is the future of the partnership and its long-term growth visibility that is most exciting to us. Simply put, we believe that what is good for NextEra Energy tends to be good for NextEra Energy Partners, and what is good for decarbonization of the U.S. economy is going to be terrific for shareholders of NextEra Energy as well as for unitholders of NextEra Energy Partners. We will have more to share about our long-term growth prospects at both companies at our investor conference in June. I'd like to close by once again thanking our team. In addition to the 900 Project Velocity ideas I mentioned earlier, last week, we held our annual team competition for the Highest Quality and Innovation Award at our company, followed by our Employee Expo in which 56 teams were featured. I can tell you that, as impressive as our track record has been over the last 30-plus years, our future is even brighter. Our team continues to impress with their creativity, analytical abilities, innovation, customer focus and the will to win. I truly believe that we have the best team in the industry. I believe this team can extend our long-term track record of outperformance, and I believe this is the team that can and will lead the decarbonization of the entire U.S. economy. Thank you for your continued support of our company, and I'd now look forward to taking your questions.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. You may now go ahead.
Steve Fleishman: Yes. Hi. Good morning. Thank you and John, Kirk, congrats on your new roles.
John Ketchum: Thank you.
Kirk Crews: Thank you, Steve.
Steve Fleishman: So – you bet. Kirk, just the AD CVD is obviously an important issue and you made some really interesting comments here. So my questions are going to focus on that. The comment about the tariffs not being known if they decided to go that route till 2025, that would seem to be incredibly disruptive to the sector. So just – could you just talk about like how that process works and why to actually set the tariffs to better understand why it would be that long?
John Ketchum: Yes, Steve, let me go ahead and take that. This is John speaking. That's one of the things that we're pointing out to the Commerce Department is that when they established tariffs, say they come up with a final determination of January of 2023, their practice has always been to impose the tariffs and calculate the actual amounts and release those two years later. So those tariffs would not be known until the first quarter of 2025. And so, what the industry would be forced to do perversely is actually go back and buy panels from China because the tariffs in China are known. And China is the only country in the world that would have panels available to sell because, as we said in our remarks, the U.S. panel manufacturing industry, which is incredibly small, again, even at full capacity it only has the ability to satisfy 10% to 20% of the entire U.S. demand. The U.S. industry is sold out until 2025. And if you don't know what the tariff rates are in Southeast Asia, it forces you back to China where the tariffs are known and have been known for the last 10 years, which is an absolutely perverse outcome, an outrageous outcome, quite frankly, and one we intend to make sure that the Commerce Department clearly understands because that's an unintended consequence that I don't think anybody wants. And the other point that goes along with it is if we're trying to be tough on trade, we're not. China is not the one that pays the price. Who pays the price here are American companies, American workers, the American consumer that pays higher electricity costs than they ever have before in a rapidly increasing natural gas price environment, oil prices, coal prices. Solar is actually deflationary. And you actually reward the Chinese, who then get to sell panels at the inflated rate. So that makes absolutely no sense at all. When you look at our company and our business, we are in, I think, a different position than the rest of the industry is. While all those things are not good for the industry, I think our company is in a position to be able to manage these risks fortunately. We have strong contracts in place. We do have a global supply chain and sourcing capability that gives us options that others don't. But back to the strength of our contracts, I think that that gives us the ability that others might not have to continue sourcing from our existing supply base even in South Korea without – or I mean in Southeast Asia without those tariff amounts being fully known. But the problem that this creates with that two year delay into 2025, if build back better doesn't get passed or some form of reconciliation, you're also on the ITC clock that is expiring over that same period of time. So you have to have an ability to go source those panels, find them someplace else to get your projects built. Again, we're confident in our ability to be able to do that just given the strength of our contracts that's why – and we're also optimistic that the outcome here is so outrageous and so ludicrous that the Commerce Department won't possibly, based on their four prior rulings over the last decade, 2012, 2014, 2020 and in 2021, where this exact question has been asked and answered by three separate administrations, including this one, how can you possibly pull the rug out from under the industry, makes absolutely no sense to force business back to China, which is what you were trying to prevent in the first place.
Steve Fleishman: That's super helpful. Just a couple quick follow-ups on the same issue, which is, first, given everything you said, why did they initiate this in the first place? Did they not understand the implications? Second, are you seeing any better movement as a result of what's already happened to build back better? And then the last one is just in that worst-case event that we have to wait till 2025 to work this out and you reiterated back a month ago that even with this review confidence in the high end of the target, does that include that scenario?
John Ketchum: Yes. Let me take those in order. So, first of all, why did they take the investigation? You saw what happened in October. They had a similar filing that was made around circumvention, the same Department of Commerce decided not to take that up in the same year that the rule that making cells and panels outside of China was okay. Here in 2022, I think, they looked at it and said okay, well, this is the second one in a row. Let's take on the investigation. We don't think the investigation itself if we just do a little bit more fact-finding will actually have an impact on the industry. They were wrong. It does. We told them it would. And you can see it in our own portfolio at 2.1 to 2.8 gigawatts potentially being moved into 2023. Luckily, we have enough cushion and enough other things that we can do or doesn't impact our financial expectations that movement. Other companies in the industry are not that fortunate. And so, our hope is that they look at the information. We don't think the information has changed. And they rely on the prior four decisions from 2012, 2014, 2020 and 2021 to follow a consistent trade practice rather than retroactively changing the rules for an industry that has been playing by the rules for the last decade, that would make absolutely no sense in an environment where you have inflation, increasing commodity prices and the only deflationary product and source of generation that also achieves clean energy goals and creates a ton of American jobs. You’re stymieing rather than helping. So that’s the rationale. The second question I think you had was on, where are we on BBB? So look, if you’re really looking at – if you look at BBA – BBB in the current environment now is the time to move forward on it like no other. Given the inflationary pressures on energy prices now is the time to double down on renewables. Now is the time to create real manufacturing incentives if you want to re-domesticate the supply chain to the U.S., which is really, really small right now. And if you want to create those manufacturing incentives, do it with a carrot rather than a stick. So we can achieve our clean energy goals over time. So that gives us some optimism, number one, going in. Second, I think there’s motivation going into the midterms to get our energy policy, right, particularly our clean energy policy, right. And I think the Democrats do need a win going into these midterms, the structure is much the same. So there wouldn’t – we’re not contemplating a large chain of structure, both sides are talking. I think for the first time in a while we have the Supreme Court nomination behind us. Time is, something we got to work with the reconciliation for this year expires at the end of September. So we’ve really got to try to get something moving forward before the August resource or recess, but remain optimistic that we will be able to get that moving forward. And if it does a much skinnier down package that I would expect to look like a focus really just on climate and clean energy and prescription drugs. And that would be I think, a smaller package that that might be able to move forward. But I think at the same time, there’s going to have to be some open mindedness from the progresses, which I think we are seeing, Senator Manchin made no secret that we need pipeline infrastructure in this country projects like MVP, for example, in more of an, all of the above approach to tackling this issue. And I think there is a rational outcome there that would make sense for all parties involved. And then I think your last question was if we have to wait until 2025, what’s the impact on our long-term expectations. Again, we have strong contracts, we have a global supply chain capability, we would not, based on what we know today expect any changes to our long-term financial expectations.
Steve Fleishman: Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. You may now go ahead.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning team. Thanks for the time and congrats again on the promotions here guys.
John Ketchum: Good morning, Julian.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Good morning. So I just want to come back to the earnings impact on you guys. I certainly appreciate the macro that you guys have described here. But can you speak more specifically to the earnings offsets, not just in 2022, but especially 2023 and 2024, given that the timing of these renewable and services tends to impact the subsequent year more so? And then if I’m hearing you right, again, I know you keep talking about Chinese imports, but is that the answer here in lieu of having clarity effectively, and this is a matter of timing and pivoting into a Chinese supply solution in some form or another, or at least creating your own domestic supply rapidly. Just clearly, we’re not going to sit here until 2025. Just want to get some understanding as to what the earnings mitigation is in the near term and what that answer is in 2023, 2024?
John Ketchum: Julien, thank you for the question. In terms of the way we’re thinking about being able to manage this and continue to still have the confidence to reaffirm our adjusted earnings expectations and reiterate that we would be disappointed if we were not able to deliver financial results at near the high end of the range. Look, we are a very large company with a diverse set of growth drivers. FPL is performing really well. We have great visibility into the next four years with the settlement agreement. We run the business with a lot of financial discipline and build a conservative financial plan. We – as we discussed today continue to find ways to run the business more efficiently and have identified through the project velocity over $400 million of run rate savings that we expect to be able to receive over the next few years. When we add all that up and particularly think about how conservatively we are with the way we structure our plan. We feel very comfortable and being able to continue to deliver on our financial expectations. Yes. And then Julian, I’ll take the last piece on the – I think what I understood your question to be on the supply chain. So that’s the other reason why we don’t think any action is required by the department of commerce today because the supply chain is already changing for the entire industry. Polysilicon is now being sourced out to Germany. It’s being sourced out to the United States. Suppliers are quickly becoming more vertically integrated and moving their ingot and wafer producing capabilities outside of China, where cells and modules are already made. And that will be a sourcing strategy that will be followed by us and much of the industry going forward, including I think by the U.S., the so-called U.S. panel manufacturers one – because one thing I want to make sure people understand. As I said before at full capacity, the U.S. panel manufacturers can satisfy only 10% to 20% of U.S. demand, but when they make panels in the U.S., they’re not really making panels in the U.S. They’re importing all of the products that go into a panel from outside the U.S., mainly from the Southeast Asian countries. And they have these small assembly shops in the U.S. that employ a few hundred people that go ahead and just put it together. And then they stamp the panel made in the USA when it really isn’t. And that’s one of the frustrating things that we’re tackling here, but we are – again, as I said, moving the supply chain outside of China and the U.S. panel manufacturers I assume will be looking at some more things for their continued reliance on imports as they think about their strategy going forward as well.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. But just on your earnings impact, it sounds like this is about accelerating velocity, basically accelerating cost savings into the near term to offset some of the impacts as well as maybe some FPL drivers, rather than saying we’re going to do more wind versus what the plan is kind of a near-term sense. And actually, if you can speak to the FPL piece, just on CapEx changes versus the 10-K. It seems like the range is a little bit lower. But again, I’ll let you respond holistically.
John Ketchum: Yes. So on the first piece of your question, cost savings is one piece of it. We have cushion in our plan. We run the business very conservatively. We have cushion in the plan. We expect to be okay. Kirk, I’ll let you take the FPL question.
Kirk Crews: Sure. Julien, as we’ve thought about the CapEx plan at FPL, as we discussed on the call today, the expectation is – for this year is roughly $7.9 billion to $8.3 billion of capital that we plan to deploy. We also laid out in the discussion around the 10-year site plan what we’re thinking in terms of solar that we’re going to add to the system. We feel very good about the capital program that we have at FPL over the next four years in not just generation, but as well as T&D infrastructure, hardening and undergrounding. So, we have a very good plan there at FPL. Also, I think it’s important to keep in mind with respect to FPL, as we discussed on – in the prepared remarks as well, we are continuing to see just significant growth at FPL, organic growth, in terms of people coming to Florida. At 91,000 additional customers added in roughly four or five years, we’re going to add the size of Gulf to the system, and that’s going to continue to provide us with CapEx opportunities as well.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent guys. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. You may now go ahead.
Shar Pourreza: Hey good morning guys. Good morning Kirk, John.
Kirk Crews: Good morning.
Shar Pourreza: Just on the near – the 2023-2024 signed contracts. I mean, obviously, they’re up 11 gigs, so you’re getting close to the target range for those years, which could allude obviously you guys delivering within your plan. But I just – I want to get a little bit of a sense here. If the tail risks are longer dated, right, could we see more projects shifts than what you kind of disclosed in the footnote maybe into 2024 and beyond? And if so, is there a point in time, John, you start shifting into more wind from solar and storage? I mean, obviously, wind is very competitive. The returns aren’t great, but I would think several players are going to follow in similar footsteps there. So, I guess, how to think about the profile of the backlog if this is more longer dated and we don’t get visibility?
John Ketchum: Sure. Shar, I’ll take that. So the first point that I would make is that this is good for the wind business. I think you could see that from the results of our origination activity this quarter. So even to the extent we might see some shifting solar from 2022 to 2023 or 2023 to 2024, wind is coming online even faster. And remember, the development cycle for wind and the origination activity for wind is much shorter. We can originate a wind project and have it built in 10 months. And so to the extent you might see some solar activity drop off – and really, again, I view this as a 2022 and 2023 issue. The beauty of it is, you have wind to step in and gets placed. And that’s an area where we have significant competitive advantages. And being able to sell 23 wind at a 80% PTC, we can be extremely competitive in the pricing there and in the offering. And it provides us with, I think, a mitigation measure on top of the strong supplier contracts that we already have on the solar side that others in the industry don’t have. It’s great to have a diversified business to be able to fall back on, and that’s why we feel good about our financial expectations.
Shar Pourreza: Got it. And then, John, just maybe just shifting to FPL. I mean you guys put out plans for additional winterization resiliency, 3,200 megawatts of new storage through to 2031. The solar programs are kind of well defined. And I know we talked about potential delays on the NEER side. But do you see opportunities conversely to maybe accelerate some of that solar CapEx on the regulated side, especially as gas costs have put a lot of pressure on affordability and certainly help from an LCOE comparability? So could we see faster maybe solar deployment on the regulated side to reduce what you’re seeing in the commodity curves?
John Ketchum: Yes. I think, first of all, I want to say the CapEx is actually up at FPL, just back to – I think it was Julien’s earlier question. Undergrounding is a piece of that. It’s really important we get our undergrounding in service on time and on budget. We continue to look to ways to shift that to the left. And look, as we are in an increasing natural gas price environment, the right answer for Florida customers certainly is to evaluate and look at trying to get more renewables online in Florida faster. It’s a hedge against rising natural gas prices in the state. And it’s a hedge for the country, which is another reason why, as I’ve said a couple of times already, what’s happening is quite silly.
Shar Pourreza: Got it.
Eric Silagy: The only – this is Eric Silagy. The only thing I would add is the 10-year site plan we just filed, a pretty good road map of the future opportunities. We are going to be adding a lot more solar into the system, pending the PSC’s approval. And demand for solar together continues to remain very, very strong. And so we’re going to be continuing to look at the next round for SolarTogether after the current one we just filed for. So there’s going to be additional opportunities. But again, this is about smartly deploying capital and doing the right thing for customers for the long term.
Shar Pourreza: Got it. And Eric, that – those opportunities could be incremental, right, to the current plan?
Eric Silagy: Absolutely.
Shar Pourreza: Got it. And then just really lastly, and it's unrelated to what we're talking about. But John, just on the JA case again, the federal case against a couple of executives. I know NextEra and FPL were subpoenaed. Is there any details you can provide there? Because we do get some questions on that from time-to-time.
John Ketchum: Yes. Let me just give a little bit of background there. We were asked a while back to provide some documentation in connection with that matter, which we did. We cooperated in full. We were told and have been told we are not a target of the investigation. And I think the article you're referring to, the reporter just got it flat out wrong. We have not been subpoenaed as a witness in that matter.
Shar Pourreza: Okay. Great. That's what I wanted to clarify. Congrats, John and Kirk on the promotions.
John Ketchum: Thank you.
Kirk Crews: Thanks, Shar.
Operator: Our next question will come from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. You may now go ahead.
Durgesh Chopra: Good morning team and thank you for squeezing me in and taking my question here. Just maybe…
Kirk Crews: Good morning.
Durgesh Chopra: Good morning, Kirk. Just may be, can I just a little bit more granular on the – as you get towards the sort of the preliminary ruling here in late August on the solar panel investigation? What are the key steps that we should be watching for? And what is your and other industry sort of players' involvement going to be in that process?
Kirk Crews: So the way to think about the process is right now, the DoC has provided questionnaires to different groups. Those questionnaires are being completed. I believe they're due this week for some. I believe others had requested some excisions and maybe have been granted. Once they have all that information, then the groups that are – that have standing are also allowed to weigh in on the matter. We do have standing in the case. So we will be weighing in on this as well. And then the DoC has all that information and reviews – essentially reviews the data and then reaches their preliminary determination, which is expected to happen by late August.
Durgesh Chopra: All right thank you, Kirk and then maybe just one quick one and see if you'll give this information. If not, that's okay because it's small. But can you maybe talk about the gas transaction – the gas pipeline sale? And what kind of multiple and EBITDA contribution? I know it's small. So I don't know if you can share that information. I'll just follow up with IR.
Kirk Crews: Yes. We're not going to share that information at this time. I understand the reason for the question. I would just say, as we included in the press release and in the script, it was a very attractive and accretive EBITDA multiple. We're very happy with it.
Durgesh Chopra: Perfect. Thank you so much guys. Appreciate the time.
Kirk Crews: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. You may now go ahead.
Dave Arcaro: Hi. It's Dave Arcaro on for Stephen. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit to PPA pricing that you're seeing for new contracts, I guess, across wind, solar and storage. Is there an approximate level that you would expect PPA prices to have to rise to absorb some of the inflationary pressures that we've seen? And at the end of the day, do you expect that to happen? Do you think they'll rise enough that you can protect your returns on incrementally new signed renewables contracts?
Rebecca Kujawa: Sure. This is Rebecca and I'll take that question. It's a matter of practice, what we do with our customers and as we're approaching the market is factor in whatever the current latest pricing is, which is certainly what we're doing now in terms of where we think the market is in terms of our cost as well as what the alternatives are for our customers. So keep in mind that, as we've talked about, some pricing pressure, whether it's consistent with the comments that Kirk and John have talked about on the solar side or on the wind side that it's against the backdrop of costs that have gone up, other alternative costs that have also gone up, whether it's oil or natural gas, overall power prices in the marketplace. And so there is still a significant incentive for our customers to procure renewable energy. And of course, as you've seen from our signed contracts for this quarter, the demand for wind has been really strong, both in terms of signed contracts and I'll also tell you in terms of our ongoing conversations with customers. And customers are also still very interested in pursuing solar projects. A lot of folks were caught off guard by this decision, surprised for all the reasons that John and Kirk highlighted that the Department of Commerce would have taken this step. And all of us would like to see the uncertainty resolved as quickly as possible and as favorably as possible, so that our customers can move forward with deploying solar. We'll talk more about where we see the market in terms of pricing and specifically pricing versus the alternatives at the investor conference. But again, the key takeaway from my perspective is they remain very attractive for customers.
Dave Arcaro: Great. Thanks. That's helpful color. And I was just wondering, just on the pace of new signings has that slowed down significantly since this investigation started? And would the preliminary determination potentially be a bit of a relief valve? Or could it take longer than that to start to maybe kick start the project signings again?
Rebecca Kujawa: Yes. I'm always cautious to say anything about a given quarter's signings because I think sometimes there's too much weight put on them, sometimes too little. But as of kind of an obvious point, contract signings were terrific this quarter. And I'm really proud of the execution of the team, and it very much reflects a lot of interest from customers that has not waned at all. So we're very excited about the opportunities. Nothing has changed in terms of long-term view about excitement for renewables. They remain very attractive. And as John highlighted, they should be deflationary. Absent this uncertainty and relative to the alternatives, this is a great option for customers, and we couldn't be more excited about the future.
Dave Arcaro: Great, appreciate that and thanks so much.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q4  (2022-01-25 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners' Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jessica Aldridge, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Jessica Aldridge: Thank you, Andrew. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2021 combined earnings conference call for NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. With me this morning are Jim Robo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; Rebecca Kujawa, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; John Ketchum, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources; and Mark Hickson, Executive Vice President of NextEra Energy, all of whom are also officers of NextEra Energy Partners; as well as Eric Silagy, President and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light Company. Jim will provide some opening remarks, and we'll then turn the call over to Rebecca for a review of our fourth quarter and full year results. Our executive team will then be available to answer your questions. We will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call in the risk factors of the accompanying presentation or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found on our websites, nexteraenergy.com and nexteraenergypartners.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. Today's presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of historical non-GAAP measures to the closest GAAP financial measure. As a reminder, Gulf Power legally merged into Florida Power & Light Company effective on January 1, 2021. Gulf Power continued as a separate reportable segment within Florida Power & Light and NextEra Energy through 2021, serving its existing customers under separate retail rates. Throughout today's presentation, when we refer to FPL, we are referring to Florida Power & Light, excluding Gulf Power, unless otherwise noted or when using the term combined. With that, I will turn the call over to Jim.
Jim Robo: Thanks, Jessica, and good morning everyone. Both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners had an outstanding year in 2021 and are well positioned to capitalize on the substantial opportunities that lie ahead. NextEra Energy's performance was strong both financially and operationally, and we executed the largest capital program in our history, investing approximately $16 billion in American Energy infrastructure in 2021, which we expect will again place NextEra Energy among the top capital investors in the U.S. across all industries. Continuing our long track record of delivering value for shareholders, NextEra Energy achieved full-year adjusted earnings per share of $2.55, up more than 10% from 2020. Over the past 10 years, we've delivered compound annual growth and adjusted EPS of approximately 9%, which is the highest among all top 10 U.S. power companies, who have achieved, on average, compound annual growth of roughly 3% over the same period. Amid this significant growth, the company has maintained one of the strongest balance sheets and credit positions in the industry. In 2021, we delivered a total shareholder return of more than 23%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 Utilities Index and continuing to outperform both the S&P 500 and the S&P 500 Utilities Index in terms of total shareholder return on a 3, 5, 10 and 15-year basis. Over the past 15 years, we've outperformed nearly all of the other companies in the S&P 500 Utilities Index and quadrupled the average total shareholder return of the index. Over the same period, we've outperformed 80% of the companies in the S&P 500 while nearly tripling the average total shareholder return of the index. We are proud of our long-term track record of providing growth and value creation opportunities for our shareholders, and we remain intensely focused on execution and continuing to drive shareholder value over the coming years. At FPL, net income increased nearly 11% year-over-year while continuing to deliver on its commitment to making smart, long-term investments in innovative technology, clean energy and strengthening our electric grid for the benefit of our customers. We were pleased the Florida Public Service Commission unanimously approved the settlement agreement in October, an agreement, which we believe is a fair and balanced outcome in our base rate case. The 2021 settlement agreement supports continued smart capital investments, including the largest solar build-out by a utility in the U.S. while keeping FPL's typical residential bills well below the national average and among the lowest in Florida through the end of 2025. For customers in Northwest Florida, typical customer bills are projected to decline over the next four years. Among the long-term infrastructure investments anticipated in the new agreement, new solar generation is expected to grow through the expanded SolarTogether community solar program, which is expected to more than double over the next four years, as well as through new base rate solar generation, including the nearly 1,800 megawatts to be recovered under solar base rate adjustments, or SoBRA, upon reaching commercial operations in 2024 and 2025. In total, our current solar build-out expectations are for approximately 4,800 megawatts of new solar over the term of the settlement agreement. In early 2019, FPL announced its ground-breaking goal to install 30 million solar panels in Florida by 2030. With the anticipated solar additions approved under the settlement agreement, I am pleased to announce that we now expect to reach this milestone by 2025, five years earlier than previously anticipated. Including the solar additions anticipated through 2025, this ambitious 30-by-30 initiative is expected to have generated approximately $2.5 billion in fuel cost savings for customers and created more than 20,000 construction jobs, while supporting the Florida economy with more than $700 million in property taxes over the life of the assets. During 2021, FPL successfully executed on its strategic initiatives, including placing another 671 megawatts of cost effective solar in service, completing the first roughly 1,500-megawatt phase of our SolarTogether community solar program. Additionally, last month we commissioned the world’s largest integrated solar-powered battery system, the 409-megawatt Manatee Energy Storage Center, which will allow our customers to benefit from low-cost solar energy even during times when the sun is not shining. FPL has also continued to provide exceptional service reliability, achieving its best-ever reliability rate in 2021, and FPL was recognized for the sixth time in seven years as being the most reliable electric utility in the nation. Moreover, FPL was ranked number one in both residential and business customer satisfaction in the southern U.S. amongst large electric providers by J.D. Power in 2021, and we are completely committed to continuing to provide clean, affordable, and reliable service to our customers for many years to come. Energy Resources also had a terrific year in 2021, delivering adjusted earnings growth of 13% versus the prior year. The team also had an outstanding, record year of renewables and storage origination, adding approximately 7,200 net megawatts to our backlog during the year as we continue to capitalize on the ongoing clean energy transition that is occurring in our nation’s generation fleet. Our backlog additions have grown at a more than 20% compound annual growth rate since 2017, and we are well on our way to meeting our current development expectations for new signed contracts. With the significant additions to our backlog of signed contracts over the last year, we've now signed nearly 80% of the megawatts needed to realize the midpoint of our 2021 to 2024 development expectations range with significant time remaining to sign additional power purchase agreements. Our supply chain and engineering and construction teams also continued to execute in 2021, commissioning approximately 3,800 megawatts of new wind and wind repowerings, solar and storage projects. Over the past two years, Energy Resources has constructed more than 9,500 megawatts of renewables and storage projects, demonstrating the strength and resiliency of its execution expertise even in the midst of a global pandemic and industry-wide supply chain disruptions. Finally, during 2021 NextEra Energy Transmission furthered its efforts to grow America's leading competitive transmission company and had its best year ever. During the year, the business delivered a record earnings contribution by increasing net income by nearly 20% over its previous earnings contribution record in 2020. Growth in renewables means that there is also a growing imperative to build additional transmission across the U.S. to support this transition to a low-cost, low-carbon economy fueled by renewable energy. We anticipate that NextEra Energy Transmission will continue to capitalize on the growing opportunity set to both deploy capital profitably as well as to enable further renewables deployment. The tremendous execution of both of the major businesses in recent years including 2021 gives us great visibility to the longer-term outlook of NextEra Energy. Let me start with our opportunity set, which I would not trade with anyone in our industry. At Florida Power & Light, the settlement agreement allows us to focus on operating the business efficiently, reliably and affordably for the benefit of our customers. Under the new agreement, we expect our average annual growth in regulatory capital employed to be between 8 and 9 percent over the four-year term through 2025. When you put it all together: low bills, best-in-class reliability, award-winning customer service and a clean emissions profile are what help FPL provide, what we believe, is one of the best customer value propositions in the nation. At Energy Resources, our outlook for new renewables and storage development remains as strong as ever, and we are excited to be able to continue supporting the industry's transition away from old, inefficient forms of generation and into clean, reliable, low-cost renewables and storage. We believe that the rapidly accelerating trend toward electrification and decarbonization of a broad range of sectors across the U.S. economy has significantly increased the total addressable market for new renewables and storage even beyond our expectations just a few years ago and is now measured in trillions of dollars of capital investment opportunity in the coming decades. We believe that Energy Resources is uniquely positioned to advance its market leadership position in this environment. We have been in the renewables business for more than 30 years and have the experience, resources, balance sheet, talent and advanced data capabilities necessary to execute complex renewable energy generation and storage integration projects at scale. We believe we have an excellent opportunity set for continued growth ahead of us at Energy Resources, and we will further discuss our long-term plans for deploying renewables at both Energy Resources and Florida Power & Light and the associated impact to our overall emissions profile and future goals at our upcoming investor conference, which we plan to hold on June 14th in New York City. With the anticipated continued strength of the investment opportunities at both Florida Power & Light and NextEra Energy Resources, I am pleased to announce that we are increasing our adjusted earnings per share expectations for 2022 and 2023 and introducing our expectations for 2024 and 2025. For 2022, we are now expecting our adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.75 to $2.85, up from our prior range of $2.55 to $2.75. For years 2023 through 2025, we expect to grow our adjusted earnings per share by roughly 6 to 8 percent per year off the expected 2022 adjusted earnings per share. For 2023, this translates to a new range of $2.93 to $3.08, up from our prior range of $2.77 to $2.97. Our new adjusted earnings per share expectations for 2024 are $3.13 to $3.33, and for 2025 are $3.35 to $3.60. As always, our expectations assume our usual caveats, including normal weather and operating conditions. In summary, we continue to remain as enthusiastic as ever about NextEra Energy’s long-term growth prospects. Based on the strength and resiliency of our underlying businesses, we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted earnings per share expectations ranges in each of 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025, while at the same time maintaining our strong credit ratings. Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners, which delivered a total unitholder return of approximately 30% in 2021, bringing its two-year total unitholder return up to more than 72% and further advancing its history of value creation since the IPO in 2014. For 2021, the NextEra Energy Partners grew its LP distributions per unit by 15% year-over-year and has now grown its distributions per unit by nearly 280% since the IPO. NextEra Energy Partners achieved its distribution growth objectives while maintaining a trailing twelve-month payout ratio of approximately 80% as of year-end 2021. NextEra Energy Partners had a terrific year of execution in 2021 and we are increasing our year-end 2021 financial expectations to reflect this better-than-expected growth execution. NextEra Energy Partners delivered year-end run-rate adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution in excess of our prior expectations, including delivering more than 13% year-over-year growth in run-rate cash available for distribution at the midpoints. This execution is supported by NextEra Energy Partners' outstanding portfolio of clean energy assets, which was further diversified in 2021. During the year, NextEra Energy Partners acquired interests in approximately 1,900 net megawatts of long-term contracted renewables and storage assets from Energy Resources. In addition, during the year NextEra Energy Partners successfully completed two acquisitions of renewable energy assets from third parties, adding nearly 500 megawatts of operating wind projects to its portfolio. These transactions demonstrate NextEra Energy' ability to leverage the operational expertise of NextEra Energy Resources, low-cost sources of capital and our strong industry relationships to be successful in third party acquisitions. The combination of a growing portfolio at Energy Resources and a growing set of opportunities to acquire renewables from third parties, as well as significant organic growth opportunities, further supports the partnership's long-term growth visibility. NextEra Energy Partners also continue to demonstrate its ability to access attractive sources of capital to finance its growth investments, including executing on the lowest-cost convertible equity portfolio financing in its history. The roughly $820 million convertible equity portfolio financing carries a low implied cash coupon to the investor and partially funded NextEra Energy Partners acquisition of a 50% interest in a renewable portfolio, consisting of approximately 2,520 megawatts of newly constructed or in construction renewables projects and approximately 115 megawatts of integrated battery storage. NextEra Energy Partners was able to demonstrate the benefits to LP, unit holders of the convertible equity portfolio financing structure during the fourth quarter, when the partnership exercised its right to purchase 100% of the outstanding, minority equity interests in the portfolio of wind and solar assets supporting it's 2018, convertible equity portfolio financing. Relative to issuing the same amount of common equity in 2018 to fund our growth needs, this financing allowed us to reduce unit issuance by more than 50% and save more than $140 million or roughly 75% and nominal cash costs, while retaining the more than 80% increase in the NEP unit price over the last three years. NextEra Energy Partners public float has increased approximately 50% since 2019. We believe our strategy of using low-cost, convertible equity products to efficiently layer in common equity over time has created significant value for existing LP unit holders. I continue to believe that the combination of NextEra Energy Partners clean energy, portfolio growth visibility and financing flexibility offers LP unit holders, a uniquely attractive investor value proposition. As with NextEra Energy, we remain intensely focused on continuing to execute and deliver that unit holder value over the coming years. Finally, I'd like to comment on some important organizational changes that we announced this morning. These changes are part of a long-term succession process undertaken by the Board and me over the better part of the last six years. Effective, March 1 John Ketchum apprised me as President and CEO of NextEra Energy. Rebecca will succeed John as President and CEO of NextEra Energy Resources; Kirk Crews currently Vice President of Business Management for NextEra Energy Resources will secede Rebecca as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy. John, Rebecca and Kirk will also be appointed to the respective roles at NextEra Energy Partners. In addition, Eric Silagy, President and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light Company has been named Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light. It has been an honor and a privilege to serve as CEO for nearly ten years. I'm as excited as I have ever been about the future prospects of NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. A big part of a CEO's legacy is the new leader in the next-generation leadership team that follows. And I couldn't be more thrilled about turning over the CEO role of this great company to John. I know he will be as focused on creating value for you, our owners, as I have been over the last two decades. John has been an incredible partner to me and a senior leader in this company for more than 19 years. And I can think of no better person to succeed me as CEO. John's breadth of experience across all aspects of our company, including commercial, operational, financial, and legal, as well as the significant leadership capabilities and vision, position him exceptionally well to lead NextEra Energy to even greater heights in the coming years. I also want to congratulate Rebecca, Eric and Kirk on their new roles. One of the defining characteristics of this company over the last 30 years has been the quality and strength of its leadership team, and I'm very proud of and excited for the team that will leave this company into the future. Most importantly, I want to thank my team and all our employees for all that they have done. Our team, the best in the business, has built this amazing company, and I can't thank them enough. As the announcement mentioned, I'm going to remain as Executive Chairman for a transition period to support John in his new role. I will now turn the call over to John, who would like to make some remarks.
John Ketchum: Thank you, Jim. And good morning, everyone. I have been privileged to have worked with and learned from Jim during an incredible period of growth for our company. And I am honored to have the opportunity to lead this company in the years ahead. As CEO, I intend to remain intensely focused on delivering value for our shareholders and building upon our long track record of success. I believe there is no company better positioned to lead our country's energy transformation than NextEra Energy. And I am humbled by the opportunity to lead this team through such an exciting period for our company. I am fortunate to have a broad leadership team with the experience and capability that I, too, believe is the best in the industry. I am very excited to have Eric, Rebecca and Kirk take on these expanded and new roles in the company. They, along with our broader leadership team and all of our approximately 15,000 employees, work tirelessly every day to serve our customers in Florida and across North America. Finally, I wanted to take a moment to thank Jim for his exceptional leadership and friendship. Jim has been an unbelievable steward of this company over his nearly ten years as CEO, growing the leading, most profitable, electric utility and renewable energy company in North America. Our total shareholder return during Jim's tenure has been more than 500%, and it is great evidence of Jim's exceptional vision, leadership and commitment to excellence. I know I speak for all of our employees that we are deeply grateful for everything Jim has done for our company. Let me now turn it over to Rebecca for a more detailed review of our results.
Rebecca Kujawa: Thank you, John. And good morning, everyone. Let's now turn to the detailed results, beginning with FPL. For the fourth quarter of 2021, FPL reported net income of $560 million or $0.28 per share, up $0.03 per share year-over-year. For the full year 2021, FPL reported net income of $2.94 billion or $1.49 per share, an increase of $0.14 per share versus 2020. Regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 11% for 2021, and was the principal driver of FPL's net income growth of nearly 11% for the full year. During the fourth quarter, net income was impacted by a number of factors, including an approximately $32 million pretax contribution to our charitable foundation that will allow it to continue to support the communities that we serve. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter, bringing its full year capital investments to a total of roughly $6.8 billion. FPL's reported ROE for regulatory purposes is expected to be 11.6% for the 12 months ended December 31, 2021. During the fourth quarter, we utilized approximately $137 million of reserved amortization, leaving FPL with a year-end 2021 balance of $460 million. As a reminder, our new four-year settlement agreement became effective this month, and includes the flexibility over the four-year term to amortize up to $1.45 billion of depreciation reserve surplus, which is inclusive of $346 million in reserve amount that we previously anticipated to be remaining at year-end 2021 under FPL's now expired 2016 rate agreement. Consistent with the terms of the 2021 settlement agreement, half of the $114 million in excess reserve balance at year-end 2021 will be used to reduce our outstanding capital recovery asset balance. And the other half will increase FPL's storm reserve to offset future restoration costs. As a reminder, the new agreement limits reserve amortization to $200 million in 2022, which we will treat as a limitation in any given quarter during the year. Given the historical shape of our customer usage, we typically use more reserve amortization in the first half of the year and reverse reserve amortization in the hotter summer months. We currently expect FPL to initially earn below our target regulatory ROE in the early part of 2022. Although for the full year we are targeting the upper end of the allowed range of 9.7% to 11.7%. As a result, we also expect FPL's earnings growth to be lower in the first half of the year and higher in the second half. As always, our expectations assume our usual caveats, including normal weather and operating conditions. Our overall capital program at Florida Power & Light is progressing well. We continue to advance one of the nation's largest solar expansions and met our solar deployment objectives at both FPL and Gulf Power in 2021, including commissioning more than 800 megawatts of new solar across the combined system. Beyond solar, construction on the highly efficient roughly 1,200-megawatt Dania Beach Clean Energy Center remains on schedule and on budget, as it continues to advance towards its projected commercial operations date later this year. The North Florida Resiliency Connection remains on track to be in service by mid-2022. Let me now turn to Gulf Power, which, as a reminder, was legally merged into FPL on January 1, 2021, but continue to be reported as a separate regulated segment during 2021. Gulf Power reported fourth quarter 2021 GAAP earnings of $60 million or $0.03 per share. For the full year, Gulf Power reported net income of $271 million or $0.14 per share an increase of $0.02 per share year-over-year. Base O&M reductions and investments in the business were the primary drivers of Gulf Power's approximately 14% year-over-year growth in net income. Gulf Power's capital expenditures for the full year were roughly $800 million, and it’s reported ROE for regulatory purposes is expected to be approximately 11.25% for the 12 months ending December 2021. Given that this is the last time we will be talking about Gulf Power's financial results, let me take a moment to summarize the team's execution over the past three years. Gulf Power has delivered significant improvements in all key financial and operational metrics, while meaningfully improving its customer value proposition. The execution of the NextEra Energy playbook at Gulf Power, which is focusing on reducing costs and making smart capital investments for the benefit of customers, has been a remarkable success. Gulf Power has realized a nearly 40% reduction in O&M costs since the acquisition. Since 2018, Gulf Power improved service reliability by nearly 60%, and was awarded national recognition for its outstanding reliability performance in the Southeast suburban and rural service area for the second year in a row in 2021. Over the same period, Gulf Power realized an approximately 60% improvement in safety among our employees who have worked tirelessly to help us execute on our plans. Regulatory capital employed has grown by approximately 16% compound annual growth rate since 2018. We have invested approximately $2.5 billion in long-term improvements to Gulf Power's existing system and generation fleet. As a result of our clean power modernization investments at Gulf Power, we have already delivered an approximately 25% reduction in CO2 emissions over the last three years, and we look forward to further expanding the opportunity for our customers to access clean, low-cost solar and storage in the years to come. This high level of performance across the board could not have been possible without the hard work and commitment of all of the Gulf Power employees. And I would like to thank all of our Florida Power & Light employees, old and new, for their relentless focus on reducing costs while improving reliability and safety over the past three years. Execution of the plans that we laid out at Gulf Power has generated great outcomes for our shareholders as well. Gulf Power's net income has grown by a compound annual growth rate of approximately 19% since 2018, an outcome that was even better than our expectations when we announced the acquisition. Our performance with Gulf Power is a clear validation of our strategy and our conviction that you can be clean, reliable, affordable and profitable at the same time. The Florida economy remains strong. Over the last 10 years, Florida's GDP has grown at a roughly 5% compound annual growth rate. The GDP of Florida is roughly $1.2 trillion, which is up approximately 8% from pre-pandemic levels and would make Florida the 15th largest economy in the world. At the same time, Florida's population continues to grow at one of the fastest rates in the nation. According to recent Census Bureau data, more people moved to Florida from other parts of the country than to any other state in 2021. We believe this is a reflection of Florida's unique proposition in terms of great weather, low taxes and a pro-business economy, all of which should support ongoing customer growth at Florida Power & Light. Over the past year, Florida has created more than 485,000 new private sector jobs and Florida's labor force participation rate has improved significantly. Three months average Florida building permits, a leading indicator of residential new service accounts are up 15% year-over-year and have outpaced the nation's quarterly growth in new building permits by roughly 13%. Other measures of confidence in the Florida economy have meaningfully improved versus the prior year, including a 34% improvement in Florida's retail sales index and a 2.6% decline in mortgage delinquencies while mortgage delinquencies across the U.S. have remained roughly flat. During the quarter, FPL's average customer growth was strong, increasing by nearly 82,000 customers from the comparable prior year quarter. FPL's fourth quarter retail sales were down 1.5% versus the prior year period, driven by an unfavorable weather comparison. For 2021, FPL's retail sales increased 1.7% from the prior year on a weather-normalized basis, driven primarily by ongoing strong customer growth and a 1.5% year-over-year increase in underlying usage per customer. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide. Energy Resources reported fourth quarter 2021 GAAP net income of $851 million or $0.43 per share. Adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter were $414 million or $0.21 per share. Energy Resources contribution to adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter is up $0.04 versus the prior year comparable period. For the full year, Energy Resources reported GAAP earnings of $599 million or $0.30 per share and adjusted earnings of approximately $2.21 billion or $1.12 per share. Energy Resources full year adjusted earnings per share contribution increased $0.13 or approximately 13% versus 2020. For the full year, growth was driven by continued new additions to our renewables and energy storage portfolio as contributions from new investments increased by $0.12 per share. Contributions from existing generation and storage assets decreased $0.04 versus the prior year due primarily to underperformance in our existing wind fleet as a result of extreme market conditions in Texas in February of last year. NextEra Energy Transmission and Gas Infrastructure contributed favorably, increasing results by $0.01 and $0.02, respectively, year-over-year, while the contribution from our customer supply and trading businesses decreased $0.02 versus 2020; all of their impacts increased results by $0.04 year-over-year. As Jim mentioned, Energy Resources had an outstanding year delivering our best year ever for origination, adding approximately 7,200 net megawatts of new renewables and battery storage projects to our backlog. In 2021, we commissioned approximately 3,800 megawatts of wind, solar and storage projects, including a 110-megawatt build-on transfer project that was not included in our backlog. In addition, since the last call, we have added approximately 1,500 megawatts of renewable projects to our backlog; including approximately 700 megawatts of new wind and wind repowerings, 300 megawatts of solar, and 500 megawatts of battery storage. Our origination performance in 2021 reflects continued high demand among all customer classes for clean energy solutions that not only help achieve their renewable energy goals, but perhaps more importantly allow our customers to save energy on – save money on energy costs, while switching to lower cost forms of generation like wind, solar and solar-plus storage. Our renewables backlog now stands at more than 6,600 megawatts, which is roughly the size of our entire renewable generation portfolio at the end of 2017, and nearly 25% larger than our backlog at year-end 2020. And this provides terrific visibility into the strong growth that lies ahead for Energy Resources over the next few years. The accompanying slide provides additional details on where our development program and energy resources now stand. We remain optimistic about the expanded investment opportunities that the broad decarbonization of the U.S. economy presents for Energy Resources. We believe that there are many new market opportunities where our industry leading development platform will provide a competitive advantage to further grow our core long-term contractor of renewables and storage business. As we have previously discussed green hydrogen presents a particularly compelling new market for Energy Resources. During the fourth quarter a clean energy technology company in which we are a minority equity investor and that it has developed a proprietary process to decarbonize industrial production of hydrogen and economic prices. One, a conditional approval for an approximately $1 billion DOE, Department of Energy loan to expand its clean hydrogen and carbon black product facilities in Nebraska. Our agreement with this company provides Energy Resources the opportunity to be its preferred renewable energy supplier for the facility and we are encouraged by the acceleration of the facilities build-out that is expected to occur as a result of this new loan. Similarly, early in the year we completed the strategic investment in a liquid fuels company with a proprietary process to produce zero emissions synthetic fuels by combining green hydrogen with concentrated carbon dioxide streams captured from industrial processes. Our strategic partnership with this company includes the opportunity for energy resources to provide up to 3,000 megawatts under a preferential energy supply agreement. Finally, as part of our efforts to help our commercial and industrial customers achieve their substantial goals for both energy savings and decarbonization we recently announced an agreement with JPMorgan Chase that allows for use of our proprietary state-of-the-art smart energy software to optimize its energy use and reduce its carbon footprint. Energy Resources advanced software platform uses artificial intelligence and block-chain technology and leverages data from the industry leading renewables and storage fleet owned and operated by Energy Resources. Two, among other things match energy demand with clean energy resources available on the market in real time. We recently signed a similar agreement that allows a large university to use our advanced software platform to manage and optimize a more than 100-megawatt solar plus storage asset in California. Through these initiatives Energy Resources is leveraging its best-in-class renewable energy expertise to provide significant value to its customers in a market with meaningful growth potential. We are at the vanguard of building a sustainable energy era that is both clean and affordable, and we are driving hard to continue to be at the forefront of the disruption that is occurring within the energy sector and broader parts of the U.S. economy. Consistent with our long-term track record, we will remain disciplined as we take steps to be at the forefront of these developing markets, while taking a leadership role in clean energy transition, expected to drive tremendous growth for Energy Resources over the next decade and beyond. Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the fourth quarter of 2021 GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $1.2 billion or $0.61 per share. NextEra Energy's 2021 fourth quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $814 million or $0.41 per share respectively. For the full year 2021 GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $3.57 billion or $1.81 per share. Adjusted earnings were $5.02 billion or $2.55 per share. For the Corporate and Other segment, adjusted earnings for the full year decreased $0.05 per share compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of higher interest and refinancing costs associated with certain liability management initiatives completed during the fourth quarter to take advantage of the low interest rate environment. Our fourth quarter refinancing activities reduced nominal adjusted net income by roughly $140 million. We expect these initiatives to translate into favorable net income contribution in future years and an overall improvement in net present value for our shareholders. Specifically, during the fourth quarter, NextEra Energy successfully refinanced approximately $5.2 billion in existing debt and hybrid securities and proactively issued roughly $4.9 billion in replacement funding. This combination of redemptions and new issuance extended its maturity profile by over 6 years and is expected to generate an approximately $30 million after-tax reduction in annual interest expense in the near-term. Capital recycling remains an important part of our financing plan as we continue to execute on the tremendous growth opportunities in front of us. During the fourth quarter, Energy Resources closed on its previously announced agreements to sell a portfolio of newly constructed and under construction renewable assets to NextEra Energy Partners and to a third-party infrastructure investor. Through the sale of this 2.5-gigawatt renewables portfolio, Energy Resources was able to recycle nearly $3.5 billion of capital, including the tax equity proceeds in accretive manner, and take advantage of the strong market for wind, solar and storage assets. We believe that our renewables development platform at Energy Resources is second to none, and our ability to continue to harness market demand for renewables and recognize the value of that platform is a key competitive advantage for NextEra Energy as it continues to grow its portfolio of long-term contracted operating renewables and storage assets at Energy Resources. Turning now to our financial expectations for NextEra Energy. As Jim discussed, today we are increasing the ranges of our adjusted EPS expectations for 2022 and 2023, and introducing our expectations for 2024 and 2025. For 2022, NextEra Energy now expects adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.75 to $2.85. For 2023 through 2025, NextEra Energy expects to grow roughly 6% to 8% off of the expected 2022 adjusted earnings per share range, and we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of these ranges for each year. Details of our new financial expectations are included on the accompanying slide. From 2021 to 2025, we expect that our average annual growth in operating cash flow will be at or above our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. We also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at roughly 10% per year through at least 2022 off of a 2020 base. As always, our expectations assume our usual caveats. Let me now turn to the detailed financial results for NextEra Energy Partners. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $322 million and cash available for distribution was $91 million. Adjusted EBITDA growth versus the prior year comparable quarter was primarily due to the growth in the underlying portfolio. For the full year 2021, adjusted EBITDA was $1.36 billion, up 8% year-over-year, and was primarily driven by the full contribution from new projects acquired in late 2020. In our existing projects portfolio, favorable performance from NextEra Energy Partners' natural gas pipeline investments and contributions from the wind repowerings that we added at the end of 2020 were partially offset by weaker wind resource and lower generation at our Genesis solar project as a result of outages for major maintenance in the first and fourth quarters of 2021. For the full year, wind resource was 98% of the long-term average versus 100% in 2020. Cash available for distribution was $584 million for the full year. The benefit to cash available for distribution from lower corporate level interest expense was partially offset by comparably higher project-level financing costs on our Genesis solar project and other existing assets that were recapitalized to fund the acquisition of approximately 500 net megawatts from Energy Resources at the end of 2020. Over the past three years, NextEra Energy Partners' cash available for distribution has grown at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 20%. As a reminder, these results include the impact of IDR fees, which we treat as an operating expense. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide. Yesterday the NextEra Energy Partners Board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.7075 per common unit, or $2.83 per unit on an annualized basis, up 15% from the comparable quarterly distribution a year earlier and at the top end of the range we discussed going into 2021. During the quarter, NextEra Energy Partners closed on the initial funding of its approximately $820 million convertible equity portfolio financing with Apollo Global Management and used those proceeds, along with existing NextEra Energy Partners debt capacity, to fund its acquisition of approximately 1,300 net megawatts of renewables and storage from Energy Resources. Under the terms of the agreement, NextEra Energy Partners is expected to benefit from a low implied initial cash coupon over the first ten years despite only providing approximately 4% of the upfront capital needed to purchase the assets, while we expect will allow NextEra Energy Partners to achieve a full return of its capital invested into this acquisition in less than two years. Additionally, the financing will provide NextEra Energy Partners the flexibility to periodically buy out the investor's equity interest between the five and ten-year anniversaries of the agreement at a fixed pre-tax return of approximately 5.6% inclusive of all prior distributions, making this NextEra Energy Partners' lowest cost convertible equity portfolio financing to date. NextEra Energy Partners will have the right to pay up to 100% of the buyout price in NEP common units, issued at no discount to the then-current market price. NextEra Energy Partners also issued approximately 7.25 million new NEP common units during the fourth quarter to acquire the remaining equity interests in a portfolio of 1,388 megawatts of wind and solar assets associated with the convertible equity portfolio financing that NEP entered into in 2018. NextEra Energy Partners funded the remaining roughly $265 million of the approximately $885 million of total consideration for the acquisition of equity in the portfolio with project-level debt issued on a subset of the underlying assets. The nearly $650 million project financing supported by these assets, which was also the lowest-cost project-level debt financing in the partnership's history, is reflective of the strong performance of the underlying assets in the portfolio and also supported financing of other growth opportunities executed in 2021. From an updated base of our fourth quarter 2021 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $2.83, we continue to see 12% to 15% growth per year in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2024. We expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2022 distribution that is payable in February 2023 to be in a range of $3.17 to $3.25 per common unit. We continue to expect to achieve our 2022 distribution growth of 12% to 15% while maintaining a trailing 12-month payout ratio in the low-80% range. Given the successful execution of the recent acquisition from Energy Resources, as well as the approximately 100-megawatt operating wind facility from a third party, year-end December 31, 2021 run-rate adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution exceeded our previous expectations ranges. As a result, today we are introducing new year-end 2021 run-rate expectation ranges for adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution of $1.635 billion to $1.795 billion and $640 million to $720 million, respectively. With the combination of strong cash flow generation from the existing NextEra Energy Partners portfolio, including the approximately 2,400 net megawatts of new renewables and storage added during 2021 and its relatively low payout ratio, NextEra Energy Partners has significant flexibility in terms of acquisitions in the coming year. Although acquisitions could occur at any time in 2022, for modeling purposes it may be practical to assume that any new unannounced asset additions occur late in 2022 and therefore have limited contributions to the calendar-year 2022 expectations implied by the year-end 2021 run rates for adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution for the portfolio that we just discussed. NextEra Energy Partners run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA and CAFD at December 31, 2022 remain unchanged. Year-end 2022 run-rate adjusted EBITDA expectations are $1.775 billion to $1.975 billion and CAFD in the range of $675 million to $765 million, respectively, reflecting calendar-year 2023 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at year-end 2022. As a reminder, all of our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and include the impact of anticipated IDR fees, as we treat these as an operating expense. In summary, we continue to believe that both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners have excellent prospects for growth both in the near and longer term. Florida Power & Light, Energy Resources and NextEra Energy Partners each have an outstanding set of opportunities across the board. The progress we made in 2021 reinforces our longer-term growth prospects and, while we have a lot to execute on in 2022, we believe that we have the building blocks in place for another excellent year. That concludes our prepared remarks and with that we will open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hi, good morning team and thank you for the time and congratulations to everyone here. So many folks so well deserved. Indeed, Jim, we'll miss you, but we'll see you soon enough here, I'm sure.
Jim Robo: Thank you.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Absolutely. If I can pivot here just to some of the core questions. First off, just impressive guidance. Can you talk about how you're thinking about BBB? I mean, maybe the way to ask this is a little bit in reverse. How do you think about BBB if that had actually happened here? What assumptions are you making out in 2025 on extensions or which frankly appear more likely than not eventually anyway? And perhaps more directly, how are you thinking about investments beyond wind and solar in those 2025 figures, for instance, storage or hydrogen, for instance?
Jim Robo: So Julien, let me take that. So we don't need BBB to deliver on the expectations that we've just laid out, right. I think about BBB as an accelerator, not as something that we would need in order to deliver on what we just laid out in terms of the earnings or the backlog growth that we've projected through 2024. In terms of how am I feeling about BBB, I would say two things? I am optimistic about something happening some point this year. And I would say that might – when I say optimistic, I would say more likely than not. I think I was – I think I felt more optimistic in the fourth quarter than I do now. I think that's just reality, but I do think it's more likely than not that the clean energy piece of BBB gets acted on this year. I do think it's going to take a while. And everything we have heard says there is particularly in the Senate, I think a desire for some process and process takes time, given the Senate rules. And my sense is that it's not going to be a first quarter event, it's going to be post that either a second quarter event or honestly, probably more likely sometime in the fourth quarter after the election.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes. I got you there. Feel free to opine any more on the 2025 guidance. I know that it's probably preempting a little bit the June Analyst Day, regardless. And then maybe if I could pivot in brief, any thoughts or comments you'd like to share around some of the headlines pertaining to FPL here? I know there has been a lot of back and forth and perhaps there is a lot of context to provide there.
Jim Robo: Sure, Julien. I think on some of the Florida political headlines, I think what I'd like to say on that is pretty simple. When we got – when we received the report and those allegations that have been in the press, we conducted a very extensive and thorough investigation that included looking at company financial records. It includes looking at everyone who was named in its company e-mails also looking at their – they've all provided access to their personal e-mails and text to us as part of that investigation. And the bottom line is we found no evidence of any issues at all, any illegality or any wrongdoing on the part of FPL or any of its employees. And so, that's kind of the bottom line. And I feel very good about the investigation that we did, and I feel very good that there is no basis to any of these allegations. So I think that's probably all that we're going to say on that today. And I think Rebecca is going to talk about the 2025, your question on 2025.
Rebecca Kujawa: Julien, as you might appreciate, and I'm sure everyone does on the call, when we think about our ranges of expectations, particularly when we're talking about several years out, like you asked about specifically 2025, there are quite a number of variables that we consider in order to set those ranges. And in particular, for the comment that we provided that we'd be disappointed not to be at the high end of each of those ranges, including 2025. I would say the key parts that we think about, first on Florida Power & Light Company, we've got the outcome from the four year settlement agreement that is now the – how we expect to operate for the next couple of years, and that creates the opportunity to continue investing in the business and executing on the strategy that's been so successful for customers over quite a number of years looking back, so we can continue that for the next couple of years. And we believe that, that will enable us to grow rate base in the range of 8% to 9% on a compound annual growth rate basis, assuming all of the investments that were anticipated in the settlement agreement, ultimately, we're able to successfully bring into service. On the Energy Resources side, the biggest drivers are the ones that we've talked about and are laid out in the slide materials on Page 16. Looking at our development ranges for all of wind, solar, energy storage and wind repowering over this four year period from 2021 through 2024, which obviously would have the largest impact on what our earnings look like in 2025. As Jim highlighted, if there is change in regulatory or incentive structures, we would obviously factor that in the future. But that's not anticipated in these estimates, and we feel really good about how we're positioned to execute between now and then. We do have to execute a lot. We have to execute the energy resources, which I'm excited to take on that challenge. We have a lot to do to continue delivering like we have at Florida Power & Light, but I think we're in a great position to do so.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent team. Best of luck. See you soon.
Rebecca Kujawa: Thank you, Julien.
Operator: The next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Steve Fleishman: Yes. Thanks. Good morning. Congrats, Jim and John and everyone else. So maybe, Jim, could you just give us a little more color on what you are going to focus your time on as Executive Chair and how long you intend to likely be in that role?
Jim Robo: Sure, Steve. So I think my focus is going to be to help John with the transition and in particular, help John with the transition as it relates to the Board. You should think about my transition time in terms of months, not years. And that's probably all we're ready to say about it today. But my real focus is going to be on making John as successful as I know he will be.
Steve Fleishman: Okay. That's helpful. Second question, just on the kind of renewables development, maybe you could just talk a little bit to the trends that you're seeing there. It did seem like fourth quarter slowed versus the prior quarters in terms of backlog growth. And is there may be some kind of waiting to see what happens with folks on BBB in the market right now or anything else that you might want to highlight?
John Ketchum: Yes. Steve, I'll take this. This is John. First of all, we're coming off a record year with 7.3 gigawatts, had a strong fourth quarter, posting about 1,500 megawatts. What we are seeing in the market is continued strong demand, and that's coming from a number of different sources. It's not only coming from investor-owned utilities and munis and co-ops, but also C&I. As there's been a lot of rotation of capital into ESG funds, it's certainly getting investor attention and putting an impetus on companies to become sustainable. And so one of the things that we've spent a lot of time on over the last couple of years is our customer base and how do we market to a different customer base, not that the investor-owned utility and muni and co-op won't always be our core. It will be. But we're doing some things differently, too, around C&I., for example. Some of you might have seen the Optos release where JPMorgan is partnering with us on new software product, where we go in and we basically are able to calculate exactly what their energy footprint looks like today. How we can make it better, how we can take money out of the bill, how we can make it greener. That's just one example of some of the things that we're doing differently in terms of the ways that we approach the customer. And when I look at the pipeline that we have in place, the land positions, the interconnects, it's second to none. It's an area of certainly focus that we are continuing to build out. We'll talk a lot more about that at the Analyst Day. But we have the best sites, the best team, the best talent the best analytics and the normal competitive advantages of being able to manage the supply chain operate cheaper, finance cheaper, all those things come together, give us a lot of optimism about the future.
Steve Fleishman: Okay, great. And then one last question, just on the guidance improvement. If I had to kind of simplify kind of what's driving the higher guidance, 2022 and beyond in terms of factors? Any just kind of key reasons you would say for the higher guidance?
John Ketchum: Yes, I'll take that as well, Steve. I think Rebecca covered certainly the FPL piece. And then you think about Energy Resources. We've doubled the backlog in the last few years; continue to see a lot of promise there with or without build back better. Jim said, more likely than not that we're able to get something passed there by the end of the year. But we plan our business as if it doesn't happen. And our financial forecast is based on it not happening. And that's why we were very resolute in our ability to take our expectations up not only for 2022, but to extend the guidance out through 2025. And that's just based on what we see in our renewable backlog. And when you think about the expectations that we laid out for investors for 2021 and 2022, I think, we've done a terrific job of meeting those and then laying out 2023 and 2024. We've made tremendous headway against those expectations.
Steve Fleishman: Great, thank you.
Rebecca Kujawa: Thanks, Steve.
Operator: The next question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.
Shar Pourreza: Okay good morning, guys.
Rebecca Kujawa: Good morning.
Shar Pourreza: Congrats, Jim, John, Rebecca and team on the moves, well deserved. Just most of my questions actually just got answered. But just a quick question on near ventures. Obviously, you guys are starting to expand the playbook into CCS. Water, wastewater treatment. And obviously, in the prepared remarks, you just highlighted the hydrogen value chain opportunities there. Is the future growth of any of these type of investments more specifically predicated on any outcomes of federal policy like a hydrogen PTC? And seeing sort of the lack of progress on that front, do you anticipate any pullback from these sort of opportunities? Not the base business, not the base newer opportunities, but more specifically on the venture side.
Rebecca Kujawa: Thanks, Shar. And I appreciate the question. We do think there's a lot of opportunities as I talked about in the prepared remarks, not only of purely executing our renewables for the electricity sector, but helping use clean energy to decarbonize these other industries. And we're thinking about some of these investment opportunities as a way to explore how those business models and investment opportunities are ultimately going to shape up over time. But to answer your direct question around the incentives, the investments we've made to date do not assume that there's a change of incentives or even the specific question around hydrogen that there's a hydrogen PTC. But as John and his team, the Energy Resources team has evaluated a number of hydrogen pilot opportunities or future business opportunities. They certainly would be furthered and helped. Some of them would be by hydrogen PTC. And that's one of the things that I know we, as a whole team remain optimistic about that if something happens, whether it's the full BBB or just a climate title that happens through reconciliation, we're optimistic that a hydrogen incentive would be included in that package. I think there's a lot of opportunities to further the decarbonization of the U.S. economy through the use of hydrogen. So short answer, investments don't assume it, but I think there's even more opportunity if there are some incentives like the hydrogen PTC in the future.
Shar Pourreza: And then let me ask you, just, obviously, the opportunity is sort of that, especially as you're thinking about on the hydrogen side. As sort of the growth starts to transpire, how are you sort of thinking about credit metrics? Any potential pressures there as that business grows? And how we should be thinking about equity funding on those?
Rebecca Kujawa: Yes. One of the strategic imperatives, the way that we think about managing the business over the long-term, and I highlighted a couple of times in remarks and we highlighted on a consistent basis because it's a high priority for us is maintaining that strong balance sheet. As you've seen, quality of credit degrade elsewhere in the industry, we have remained as committed as ever to maintaining that strong balance sheet. We think it's a huge differentiator for us and being able to execute our business to deploy the capital that we deploy and to provide the stability that our customers assume and expect from us, we think a strong balance sheet is imperative. So, as we think about all of these investment opportunities, the growth in our business, that will remain a priority, and we will assume that as part of the way that we're thinking about the business as a private facia part of the strategy.
Shar Pourreza: Terrific. Thanks again I’ll pass it to someone else. And again, big congrats John and no surprises here. Thanks.
Rebecca Kujawa: Thanks, Shar.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Steven Boyd with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead
Steven Boyd: Hey good morning. I just want to echo congratulations to Jim, and to John and Rebecca, and Kirk and Eric. The performance you all have achieved is really quite remarkable. So, congrats are absolutely in order. So just so happy for you all. I wanted to spend a little time on the technology side. I guess it strikes me that within NextEra for years; you've all been developing a variety of interesting technologies, sometimes not always as visible to us. But it just strikes me that some of those developments are becoming both more visible and potentially more commercial, more of interest in terms of ways you can monetize that to a fairly broad customer base. And then just curious, I know this is a high-level question, but just interested in your take on how important technology such as some of the software development that you all mentioned could be to driving earnings power to driving growth of NextEra in the long-term?
Jessica Aldridge: Yes, Stephen, thank you for the question. And I think you're absolutely right. It's probably something that we have not talked about very much, and probably will talk about more going forward. The reason why we had not talked about it a lot in the past is we really have thought about it as a strategic advantage to us, which we continue to believe a strategic advantage to us. And we've largely used as a way to further both the profitability and the win rates on developing renewables. As we thought about how does the business grow and change and we capitalize all of these opportunities that you and we and the industry see, one of the shifts is thinking about our commercial and industrial customers, whether they are traditional C&I customers that have been interested in the products that we sell or new ones, or ones that, or more industrial in nature, agricultural in nature, they often need some additional services to help them understand how to manage their generation and load needs, think about their carbon intensity, deliver on their own environmental, social and governance goals. And some of the things that we've developed internally through all of our expertise are very appropriate and enormously valuable to these customers. So, we've seen the opportunity to continue these investments, think about how we package and sell them to customers, and you'll see a lot more of that from us going forward. And we think there's a huge opportunity to sell not only those services, but also use them as a way to deepen our relationships with our customers and ultimately deploy renewables over time.
Steven Boyd: That's really helpful Rebecca. And would that be essentially upside to the plan, in other words, sort of beyond the typical kind of numbers we see around renewables deployment, et cetera? Is this an area of upside? Or have you factored some of this into thinking about your growth?
Rebecca Kujawa: I think for base assumptions, we're including some assumptions around what we think we can do with these types of businesses. But as always, there's pluses and minuses. Fortunately, for us, they've largely been pluses in recent history, and we've been able to deliver adjusted EPS growth in excess of even what we, they have anticipated or laid out for investors prior to delivering. So hopefully, we'll be in a position to do that again over time. But for now, I think you should safely assume that our expectations are the ones we just laid out in the last couple of minutes. And we'll use all of these levers to deliver against those and again, hopefully achieve as we expect the high end of each of these ranges, which we would feel very proud of and see as enormously value accretive to shareholders.
Steven Boyd: Okay, I agree. Maybe just one last one for me. We're often asked about impediments to growth in clean energy and pretty clearly, NextEra is not experiencing that. Just curious if you could talk a little bit more about just sort of some of those impediments sort of perception versus reality, things like supply chain, labor availability, permitting, anything else? Just sort of – I think there, frankly, is sometimes a misconception about those limits to growth. And it looks like clean energy growth remains very strong, especially for NextEra. But just curious if you could just comment on those perceptions of limits on growth.
John Ketchum: Yes, let me take that one. I think you identified some of the obvious ones that we have that we are addressing, certainly, supply chain and those types of issues, and I think we've answered those. I think when I look at the market today, Stephen, the issue for companies to be successful or not successful; the biggest differentiator is going to be many of the questions that you just asked. And are you positioning your company for what is going to be a more complex energy offering that is going to be demanded by the customer? Rebecca gave the example of a C&I customer. It's not as simple as being able to approach a C&I customer and say, "Hey, I'm going to sell you 100 megawatts of wind or 100 megawatts of solar or what do you think about a 50-megawatt battery?" These are people that are selling candy bars, and bottles of water and things of that nature. They are not in our business. They need the expertise as to how they think about that addition within their existing energy needs. And so, it takes a comprehensive skill set in order to come forward with a clean energy solution that makes sense for that business. And so, when you think about a lot of the small developers that we have to compete against in solar and wind, they don't have that expertise. They don't have the ability to offer firm and shape products and things that it's going to take to really win the business. That's the first piece. The second piece is the question you asked around technology. We have been very aggressive in our investment around technology. We've talked about the NextEra Energy analytics team that we bought back in 2005. We have really built that team out. It's a group of PhD, mathematicians, software developers, software engineers, that not only use those tools to help manage our existing fleet and help leverage and drive operating efficiencies around what we do every day in managing our existing footprint, but they're now able to take all that data, all that information, all that know-how to develop comprehensive software solutions for customers. And that is a huge leg up that we have over the rest of the industry, and one of the things that we're looking at. And the third thing is renewable enablers. We are really looking at what it means to lead the energy transition. What are you going to have to be good at? And what capabilities are you going to have to have as an organization to really do that. And we have been spending the last three or four years, very focused on it. We don't talk a lot about some of the things that we're up to. You'll get more details at the Analyst Day, but needless to say and be self-assured, we're ready.
Stephen Byrd: That's great of you. Thank you so much.
Rebecca Kujawa: Thank you, Stephen.
Operator: The next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Michael Lapides: Hi guys. Thank you and congrats to everyone on all the leadership changes. I actually have two questions on the regulated business in Florida. First of all, can you just remind us, and I know you'll give us more detail six months from now. But just can you remind us what the capital spend levels for the next couple of years are, combined FP&L and gold or if you want to break it out and separate those, too?
Rebecca Kujawa: Yes, it's probably about $7 billion to $8 billion per year. It's included, Michael, in the regulatory capital employed growth of roughly 8% to 9% per year.
Michael Lapides: Got it. $7 billion, $8 billion per year, and kind of flat? Or do you see that escalating over time? And how should we think about what percent of that capital is either recovered as part of the rate case revenue requirement increase or via the tracker? And what part may – would build up as rate base and you get it back in a future case?
Rebecca Kujawa: There's a mix, of course, Michael, as you might expect and we certainly have our best laid plans that will include as part of the updated CapEx tables in the 10-K when we publish it in a couple of weeks. One comment on that, I would make and obviously there's a difference between, as you recall, from the CapEx table for FPL versus Energy Resources. But in both cases, as you get closer to that operating year, the teams tend to find good investment opportunities that are value accretive from a customer standpoint and may add and subtract to those over time. But those will be our best estimates based on what we've seen so far and also under the parameters of the settlement agreement inclusive of the SolarTogether investments that were approved as part of the settlement agreement. And also anticipate the current views around the investments on both storm hardening and undergrounding that, as you know, are included in a clause mechanism and recovered separately and approved separately over time. Those change over time depending on what we see and where we see the value coming for our customers, but we feel very good about the overall views. And of course, we'll give more details as we go into the investor conference in June.
Michael Lapides: Got it. And Rebecca, I just want to come back to some of the comments you made in your prepared remarks about FP&L and earnings targets for next year and beyond. Is it getting harder operationally, just given the size and the amount of capital you're deploying at FP&L, to hit the highest end or the top end of the earnings band? You're laying – historically, if you kind of go back and skim the transcript, always kind of talk about hitting that high end and it almost seems, and I may be misinterpreting, but the language today was kind of towards the high end, but maybe not exactly added. And I was just curious if there's a change there in terms of being able to hit the 11.7% level?
Rebecca Kujawa: Sure. Let me answer the – I don't know if you're asking full on the NextEra Energy side where we typically have the language would be disappointed not to be at or near the high end. That language is exactly the same. And if anything changes solely a stumble on my part in terms of speaking, but the language is exactly the same. If you're asking specifically around Florida Power & Light Company, the approved range, as you know, for the settlement agreement is the range of 9.7% to 11.7%. And my comment was specifically around our expectations for 2022, which, of course, is the first year of the new settlement agreement. And that also includes the one-year limitation that was included in the settlement agreement around the use of surplus amortization just in this year, which is a maximum amount of $200 million. When we think about everything, what our investment plans are, our opportunities for continuing to focus on cost improvements, other improvements for customers, the investments that we plan to make, and the use of the surplus amortization, including the shape over time. We believe that at the end of the year we'll be able to report a regulatory ROE at the high end of the range. Where exactly that is, of course, we'll refine it over the – as the year progresses. And then, of course, we'll be targeting the high end of the ROE range in future years as well.
Michael Lapides: Got it. Thank you, Rebecca. Appreciate for taking the time and congrats again.
Rebecca Kujawa: Thank you so much, Michael.
Operator: The next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Jeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning.
Rebecca Kujawa: Good morning, Jeremy.
Jeremy Tonet: You covered a lot of ground today. Just one question for me and it's kind of been touched on a few different times, but just diving in with the transition, in general. Just wondering if you could comment a little bit more about why now is the right time versus any point in the past or in the future to make the transition. And then should we expect anything new in messaging from NextEra with the transition here? Could we expect something kind of new along these lines at the Analyst Day?
Jim Robo: So Jeremy, this is Jim, on the transition. I think you heard in the prepared remarks, this is something that the Board and I have been working on really in earnest since – well, honestly, in earnest, since my first succession planning discussion as CEO back in 2012. But I let the Board know that my target for retiring as CEO was after – I let them know this in 2016, honestly, that my target was after the 2020 rate case. And I actually extended kind of my time line a bit to get through this rate case. And so that's been – it's been my plan for a very long time. Obviously, we didn't make any decisions about it until we announced it here. But it's been something that the Board and I have been discussing for a very long time and we've been very deliberate about the succession planning that we've done, and I'm really pleased with the team that's going to be leading the company into the future.
Rebecca Kujawa: And I think, Jeremy, you had a second question going into the investor conference. Can you remind me what that was?
Jeremy Tonet: Yes. Just thank you for that Jim, that's very helpful details there. And just as we look at the Analyst Day here, should we expect kind of with the transition, any kind of change that might materialize in messaging at that point at the Analyst Day? Or that's not really the expectation at this point?
John Ketchum: Yes. For the Analyst Day, first of all we have never been in a better position. We're coming off of what I would characterize as our best year as a company. And it's been really a testament to the entire lead team, not only obviously the job Jim's done, but the job Eric's done, the job Rebecca's done and the leadership team that we have in place at Energy Resources. We have an extremely deep bench with a ton of experience. I've been here almost two decades. Eric's been here almost two decades. Rebecca has been here 15 years. And we have just a wealth of experience in the team that will bring full bear on the opportunity set that we have that we have going forward. And the way I think about it is we will continue to double down on the core. That means execution. Like – unlike what we've seen in the past around FPL and the capital plan that they have for customers and for shareholders, the renewable opportunity that we have in this country. Don't forget renewables are cheap; they're the cheapest form of generation in this country with or without incentive. So we have a tremendous opportunity there as well. And then the third piece I would characterize as the renewable enablers. What are the other things that we can do as a company that we've been working on behind the scenes that will help position us to be the leader of the energy transition in this country, and we're going to deal with the best team in the industry. So that's really what you're going to hear about at the Analyst Day.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session and the NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners earnings conference call. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-10-20 14:00:56) =====
Operator: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners Q3 2021 Earnings Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please also note, today's event is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference call over to Jessica Aldridge, Director of Investor Relations. Ma'am, please go ahead.
Jessica Aldridge: Thank you, Jamie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter 2021 combined earnings conference call for NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. With me this morning are Jim Robo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; Rebecca Kujawa, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; John Ketchum, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources; and Mark Hickson, Executive Vice President of NextEra Energy, all of whom are also officers of NextEra Energy Partners; as well as Eric Silagy, President and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light Company. Rebecca will provide an overview of our results, and our executive team will then be available to answer your questions. We will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call in the Risk Factors section of the accompanying presentation or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found on our websites, nexteraenergy.com and nexteraenergypartners.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. Today's presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of historical non-GAAP measures to the closest GAAP financial measure. As a reminder, Gulf Power legally merged into Florida Power & Light Company effective on January 1, 2021. Gulf Power will continue as a separate reportable segment within Florida Power & Light and NextEra Energy through 2021, serving its existing customers under separate retail rates. Throughout today's presentation, when we refer to FPL, we are referring to Florida Power & Light, excluding Gulf Power, unless otherwise noted or when using the term combined. With that, I will turn the call over to Rebecca.
Rebecca J. Kujawa: Thank you, Jessica, and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy delivered strong third quarter results with adjusted earnings per share increasing by approximately 12% year-over-year. Both the principal businesses executed well on major initiatives and we continue to advance our opportunity set for new renewables and storage. Building upon the solid progress made in the first half of the year, NextEra Energy is well positioned to meet its overall objectives for 2021 and beyond. Earlier this month, we were honored to be named on Fortune's 2021 Change the World list, the only electric utility in the world to be recognized. This recognition is a testament to NextEra Energy's best-in-class position in the renewable energy sector and our continued commitment to the customers and communities that we serve. At FPL, net income increased approximately 10% versus the prior-year comparable period, reflecting contributions from continued investment in the business. Most notably, during the quarter, we reached what we believe is a fair and constructive long-term settlement agreement with a number of intervenors in our rate case, continuing a long history of negotiated outcomes that benefit both customers and shareholders. We believe the agreement, if approved, should enable us to continue to focus on operating the business efficiently while investing in the future to ensure resilience, reliability, affordability and clean energy for generations to come in Florida. We expect the Florida Public Service Commission to vote on our agreement at its agenda conference on October 26, and I'll provide more details on the proposed agreement in a few minutes. FPL's major capital initiatives continue to progress well, including what will be the world's largest integrated solar power battery system, the 409-megawatt FPL Manatee Energy Storage Center that is now 75% complete and on track to begin serving customers later this year. Gulf Power also had a great quarter of execution, and its strong year-to-date financial performance is attributable to continued successful implementation of the cost reduction initiatives and smart capital investments that we previously outlined. Gulf Power's year-to-date net income contribution increased approximately 14% versus the prior-year comparable period. And we remain focused on improving Gulf Power value proposition by providing lower costs, higher reliability, outstanding customer service and clean energy solutions for the benefit of our customers. At Energy Resources, adjusted earnings for the quarter increased by approximately 12% year-over-year. Our development team had another terrific quarter of new renewables and storage origination, adding approximately 2,160 megawatt to our backlog since the last earnings call, marking the best quarter of overall origination and the best quarter of new wind additions in Energy Resources' history. These backlog additions include approximately 225 megawatts of combined solar and storage projects and a 500 megawatt wind project that is intended to power an adjacent new green hydrogen facility, which I'll provide some additional details on in just a few minutes. We continue to expect that our competitive advantages will drive meaningful growth in renewables and various forms of energy storage at Energy Resources in the coming years, as the trend toward broad decarbonization across many facets of the US economy takes hold. Overall, with three strong quarters complete in 2021, we are pleased with the progress we are making at NextEra Energy, and we are well positioned to achieve the full-year financial expectations that we have previously discussed subject to our usual caveats. Now, let's look at the detailed results, beginning with FPL. For the third quarter of 2021, FPL reported net income of $836 million or $0.42 per share, which is an increase of $79 million and $0.04 per share, respectively year-over-year. Regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 10.5% over the same quarter last year and was the principal driver of FPL's year-over-year net income growth of approximately 10%. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $1.5 billion in the third quarter and we expect its full-year capital investments to total between $6.6 billion and $6.8 billion. Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.6% for the 12 months ended September 2021. During the quarter, we restored $124 million of reserve amortization, leaving FPL with a balance of $597 million. As you know, much of the East Coast of the US was recently impacted by Hurricane Ida, which made landfall on the Gulf Coast as a Category 4 hurricane and also caused catastrophic flooding across the Northeastern US. Our deepest sympathies are with those that have been impacted by Ida's widespread destruction. We value deeply the industry's commitment to mutual assistance and we were fortunate to be in a position to assist other utilities this year. As part of our assistance efforts, we sent more than 1,250 of our employees and contractors as well as transmission equipment and other supplies to help rebuild the grid to support the restoration efforts of the impacted utilities. Let me now turn to Gulf Power, which reported third quarter 2021 net income of $91 million or $0.05 per share. Gulf Power's third quarter EPS contribution was flat versus the prior-year comparable quarter. As a reminder, the third quarter of 2020 benefited from the reversal of COVID-19 related expenses that had occurred earlier in that year. During the quarter, Gulf Power's regulatory capital employed grew by approximately 13% year-over-year. Gulf Power's capital expenditures were approximately $200 million during the third quarter and we expect its full-year capital investments to be roughly $800 million. For the full year 2021, we continue to expect Gulf Power's regulatory ROE to be in the upper half of the allowed band of 9.25% to 11.25%. All of our major capital initiatives at Gulf Power are progressing well. Gulf Power anticipates bringing approximately 150 megawatts of cost effective zero emission solar capacity online within the next six months. The North Florida Resiliency Connection, which among other things, will allow customers to benefit from greater diversity in solar output across the two different time zones, is expected to be in service in mid-2022. These continued smart capital investments in renewables and core infrastructure are expected to drive customer benefits for many years to come. During the quarter, Gulf Power was impacted by Tropical Storm Fred, which experienced an unexpected change in path before striking the service territory. Through a restoration workforce of roughly 1,700 personnel, Gulf Power was able to restore its service to essentially all of the approximately 20,000 customers impacted by Fred in Northwest Florida in less than 24 hours. Moreover, the average customer outage was restored in less than 2 hours. Our culture of preparation, including our annual storm drills and the team's focused execution helped ensure an efficient, timely and safe response to the tropical storm. The economy in Florida continues to grow at a healthy pace and remains among the strongest in the nation. Florida's labor force participation rate has recovered to its highest level in nearly 18 months reflecting the ongoing recovery, following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic last year. The real estate sector in Florida also continues to grow with a three-month average new housing starts up over 40% year-over-year. In August alone, there are -- there were twice as many new housing starts in Florida than in the average over the last 10 years. Florida building permits, a leading indicator of residential new service accounts, are up 47% year-over-year and have outpaced the nation's quarterly growth by 32%. As another indicator of Florida's economic health, Florida's retail sales index is up nearly 60% versus the prior year. During the quarter, FPL's average number of customers increased by approximately 77,500 or 1.5% from the comparable year prior quarter driven by continued solid underlying population growth. FPL's third quarter retail sales decreased 1.4% from the prior-year comparable period. A decline in weather related usage per customer of approximately 2.7% offset the benefits of customer growth. On a weather-normalized basis, third quarter sales increased 1.3% with continued strong underlying usage contributing favorably. For Gulf Power, the average number of customers grew 1.6% versus the comparable prior-year quarter. And Gulf Power's third quarter retail sales increased 0.6% year-over-year with strong usage from increased customer growth contributing favorably. As a reminder, on March 12th, we initiated Florida Power & Light's 2021 base rate proceeding for rate relief beginning in January of 2022. After months of negotiation, we reached a proposed settlement agreement in early August with a number of intervenors in the proceeding. The Office of Public Counsel, The Florida Retail Federation, The Florida Industrial Power Users Group, The Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, Vote Solar, The CLEO Institute and The Federal Executive Agencies all joined the agreement, reflecting a broad set of constituents across our customer base. The four-year proposed agreement, which begins on January 2022 provides for retail base revenue adjustments as shown on the accompanying slide and allowed regulatory return on equity of 10.6% with a range of 9.7% to 11.7%, and no change to FPL's equity ratio from investor sources for the combined system. Should the average 30-year US Treasury yields be 2.49% or greater over any consecutive six-month period during the term of the agreement, Florida Power & Light's allowed regulatory ROE would increase to 10.8% with a range of 9.8% to 11.8%. Additionally, if federal or state permanent corporate income tax changes become effective during the term of the proposed agreement, Florida Power & Light would be able to prospectively adjust base rates after review of the impacts on base revenue requirements. The proposed agreement also includes flexibility over the four-year term to amortize up to $1.45 billion of depreciation reserve surplus. Consistent with the rate plan filed in March, the proposed settlement agreement would unify the rates and tariffs of FPL and Gulf Power by implementing a five-year transition rider and credit mechanism to address the initial differences in cost of serving the existing FPL and Gulf Power customers. Additionally, the proposed settlement agreement also provides for Solar Base Rate Adjustments or SoBRA, upon reaching commercial operations of up to 894 megawatts annually of new solar generation in each of 2024 and 2025, subject to a cost cap of $1,250 per kilowatt and showing an overall cost effectiveness for FPL's customers. FPL would also be authorized to expand its SolarTogether voluntary community solar program by constructing an additional 1,788 megawatts of solar generation through 2025, which would more than double the size of our current SolarTogether program and is expected to save our customers millions of dollars over the lifetime of the assets. In addition to solar energy, the settlement agreement would support FPL's green hydrogen pilot project in Okeechobee County. This innovative technology could one day unlock 100% carbon-free electricity that's available 24 hours a day. The proposed settlement agreement also introduces several electric vehicle programs and pilots designed to accelerate the growth of electric vehicle adoption and charging infrastructure investment across Florida with a total capital investment of more than $200 million. Under the proposed agreement, FPL would continue to recover prudently incurred storm costs consistent with the framework in the current settlement agreement. Future storm restoration costs would be recoverable on an interim basis beginning 60 days from the filing of a cost recovery petition, but capped at an amount that could produce a surcharge of no more than $4 for every 1,000 kilowatt hour of usage on residential bills in the first 12 months of cost recovery. Any additional costs would be eligible for recovery in subsequent years. If storm restoration costs were to exceed $800 million in any given calendar year, FPL could request an increase to the $4 surcharge. We believe the proposed settlement is fair, balanced and constructive and supports our continued ability to provide highly reliable, low cost service for our customers through the end of the decade. FPL's typical resident bill is lower today than it was 15 years ago and is well below the national average. The proposed agreement would keep typical residential bills well below the national average and among the lowest in Florida through 2025. Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported third quarter 2021 GAAP losses of $428 million or $0.22 per share. Adjusted earnings for the third quarter were $619 million or $0.31 per share, which is an increase of $68 million and $0.03 per share, respectively year-over-year. The effect of mark-to-market on non-qualifying hedges, which is excluded from adjusted earnings, was the primary driver of the difference between Energy Resources' third quarter GAAP and adjusted earnings results. Contributions from new investments added $0.03 per share relative to the prior year comparable quarter, primarily reflecting continued growth in our contracted renewables and battery storage program. The contribution from existing generation assets increased $0.01 per share year-over-year. Our customer supply and trading business contribution was $0.02 higher year-over-year due to favorable market conditions in our retail supply and power marketing businesses. All other impacts decreased results by $0.03 per share versus 2020, driven primarily by miscellaneous tax items. As I mentioned earlier, Energy Resources' development team had a record quarter of origination success, adding approximately 2,160 megawatts to our backlog. Since our last earnings call, we have added approximately 1,240 megawatts of new wind projects, 515 megawatts of new solar projects and 345 megawatts of new storage assets to our renewables and storage backlog. In addition, our backlog increased by Energy Resources' share of NextEra Energy Partners' planned acquisition of an approximately 100 megawatt operating wind project that the partnership is announcing today. Through the three -- first three quarters of 2021, we have added more than 5,700 megawatts to our renewables and storage backlog. Energy Resources' backlog of signed contracts now stands at approximately 18,100 megawatts. At this early stage, we have made terrific progress toward our long-term development expectations with more than 7,600 megawatts of projects already in our post 2022 backlog. Our backlog additions for the third quarter include a 500 megawatt wind project, the majority of which is contracted with a hydrogen fuel cell company. The project's customer intends to construct a nearby hydrogen electrolyzer facility that will use the wind energy production to supply up to 100% of the facility's load requirements. The hydrogen manufactured by the facility would enable commercial and industrial end users to replace their current gray hydrogen and fossil fuel purchases with emissions-free green hydrogen, further accelerating the decarbonization of the industrial and transportation sectors. Energy Resources also add nearly 300 megawatts of battery storage projects in California, and we continue to experience significant demand from California based utilities and commercial and industrial customers for reliable energy storage solutions. We are currently developing nearly 2,400 megawatts of additional co-located and stand-alone battery storage projects in California with the potential to be deployed in 2023 and 2024, to enhance reliability and help meet the state's energy storage capacity requirements and ambitious clean energy goals. More than 30 years, we have been investing in clean energy in California and are proud to help the state lead the country to a carbon-free sustainable future. Consistent with our focus on growing our rate regulated and long-term contracted business operations, during the third quarter, Energy Resources entered into an agreement to acquire a portfolio of rate regulated water and wastewater utility assets in eight counties near Houston, Texas. The proposed acquisition expands our regulated utility business in an attractive market with significant expected customer growth and furthers our strategy to build a world class water utility in the coming years. Subject to regulatory approvals, the acquisition is expected to close in 2022. Energy Resources is also currently in construction on an innovative water reuse and reclamation project that would help our customer achieve significant savings on its water supply needs and make its operations more efficient and sustainable while at the same time, delivering attractive returns to Energy Resources. While the roughly $45 million total equity investment for these transactions is small in context of our overall capital program, we are optimistic about the strong growth anticipated in this new market and the potential for clean water solutions to generate additional contracted renewables opportunities going forward. Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the third quarter of 2021, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $447 million or $0.23 per share. NextEra Energy's 2021 third quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $1.48 billion and $0.75 per share, respectively. Adjusted results from corporate and other segment increased by $0.01 year-over-year. Our long-term financial expectations through 2023 remain unchanged. For 2021, NextEra Energy expects adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.40 to $2.54 and we would be disappointed not to be at or near the high-end of this range. While we are pleased with our year-to-date results, which have exceeded the top end of our growth rate expectations so far for the year, we expect the fourth quarter results to include impacts from certain liability management activities that we are currently reviewing to take advantage of the low interest rate environment. These initiatives could generate negative adjusted EPS impacts of as much as $0.08 to $0.10 in the fourth quarter before translating to favorable net income contributions in future years and an overall improvement in net present value for our shareholders. Looking further ahead, for 2022 and 2023, NextEra Energy expects to grow 6% to 8% off of the expected 2021 adjusted earnings per share, and we would be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top-end of these ranges in 2022 and 2023. Our earnings expectations are supported by what we believe is the most attractive organic investment opportunity set in our industry. From 2018 to 2023, we continue to expect that operating cash flow will grow roughly in line with our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. We also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at roughly 10% rate per year through at least 2022 off of a 2020 base. As always, our expectations assume normal weather and operating conditions. Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners, which performed well and delivered third quarter results generally in line with our expectations. Yesterday, the NextEra Energy Partners Board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.685 per common unit or $2.74 per common unit on an annualized basis, continuing our track record of growing distributions at the top-end of our 12% to 15% per year growth range. Inclusive of this increase, NextEra Energy Partners has now grown its distribution per unit by more than 265% since the IPO. NextEra Energy Partners continues to execute against its growth initiatives during the quarter. Since the last earnings call, NextEra Energy Partners closed on its previously announced acquisitions of approximately 400 megawatts of operating wind projects from a third party and approximately 590 net megawatts of geographically diverse wind and solar projects from Energy Resources. In addition, today, we are announcing an agreement to acquire an approximately 100 megawatt operating wind asset in California from a third party to further expand NextEra Energy Partners portfolio and enhance its long-term growth visibility. The project is located in a strategic market with strong expected growth in renewables demand, and it also offers significant optionality to NextEra Energy Partners in terms of operational savings and long-term value creation. NextEra Energy Partners intends to purchase the asset for a total consideration of approximately $280 million, subject to closing adjustments, which includes the assumption of approximately $150 million in existing project finance debt estimated at the time of closing. NextEra Energy Partners expects to recapitalize this project finance debt in 2022 as it executes on its overall financing plan for the year. We expect to fund the approximately $130 million balance of the purchase price using existing debt capacity. Subject to regulatory approvals, the acquisition is expected to close later this year or in 2022. Following the project debt paydown next year, the asset is expected to contribute adjusted EBITDA and unlevered cash available for distribution of approximately $22 million to $27 million, each on a five-year average run rate -- annual run rate basis beginning December 31, 2022. NextEra Energy Partners continues to leverage its competitive advantages to be successful in third-party M&A and extend its long runway of growth. Consistent with our long-term growth prospects, today, we are also introducing year-end 2022 run rate expectations, which are built upon its strong existing portfolio cash generation and continued ability to access low cost capital to acquire accretive renewable energy projects. Overall, we are pleased with the year-to-date execution at NextEra Energy Partners and we believe we are well positioned to continue delivering LP unitholder value going forward. Now, let's look at the detailed results. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $334 million, up approximately 7% from the prior year comparable quarter due to growth in the underlying portfolio. New projects, which primarily reflect the asset acquisitions that closed at the end of 2020 and the recently closed acquisition of 391 megawatts of operating wind assets from a third party, contributed $23 million. Existing assets contributed $7 million, primarily driven by the wind repowerings that occurred in the fourth quarter of last year and an improvement in wind resource. Wind resource for the third quarter was 101% of the long-term average versus 96% in the third quarter of 2020. These favorable impacts were partially offset by lower solar resource in the third quarter of this year. Cash available for distribution of $158 million for the third quarter declined by $4 million versus the prior year, primarily as a result of lower year-over-year PAYGO payments after a weaker wind resource period in the second quarter of this year. As a reminder, NextEra Energy Partners recapitalized its Genesis Solar project and other existing assets at the end of last year and the impact of this new project level financing cost versus the prior year was offset by an associated reduction in corporate level interest expense as reflected in our other category. Additional details of our third quarter results are shown on the accompanying slide. On a year-to-date basis versus 2020, adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution have increased by roughly 9% and 6%, respectively. And NextEra Energy Partners remains well positioned to continue to deliver on its outstanding growth objectives. We continue to expect NextEra Energy Partners portfolio to support an annualized rate of fourth quarter 2021 distribution that is payable in February of 2022 to be in the range of $2.76 to $2.83 per common unit. From a base of our fourth quarter 2020 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $2.46, we continue to see 12% to 15% growth per year in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2024. NextEra Energy Partners continues to expect to be in the upper end of our previously disclosed year-end 2021 run rate adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution expectation ranges of $1.44 billion to $1.62 billion and $600 million to $680 million, respectively. We expect to achieve our 2022 distribution growth of 12% to 15% while maintaining a trailing 12-month payout ratio in the low 80% range. By year-end 2022, we expect the run rate for adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.775 billion to $1.975 billion and run rate for cash available for distribution to be in the range of $675 million to $765 million. At the midpoint, these revised expectations ranges reflect estimated growth in adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution of roughly 23% and 13%, respectively, from the comparable year-end 2021 run rate expectations. These growth rates are supported by our strong execution against our long-term growth objectives in 2021, including opportunistic third-party transactions that were not previously in our plan. As a reminder, all of our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and include the impact of anticipated IDR fees as we treat these as an operating expense. Finally, during the quarter, S&P updated its ratings methodology for NextEra Energy Partners. And in particular, it will now evaluate NextEra Energy Partners debt metrics on a funds from operations or FFO to debt basis with a downgrade threshold of 14% instead of a debt-to-EBITDA basis. We believe that the combination of S&P's updated methodology, its assessment of NextEra Energy Partners improving diversity and its use of less conservative assumptions in the portfolios and renewable generation cash flows will allow for several hundred million dollars more of financing flexibility relative to our previous assumptions, providing the partnership with even greater flexibility going forward to finance accretive acquisition for the benefit of our unitholders. In summary, we continue to believe that both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners have some of the best opportunity sets and execution track records in the industry and we remain as enthusiastic as ever about our future prospects. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we will open up the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning, team. Thank you for the time. I appreciate it. Impressive continued results here. Just if I can ask you at the outset here, can you perhaps describe how you see the backdrop here given the litany of different policy efforts underway around the availability of panel imports, and just how that positions your ability to execute right now. I certainly hear it echoing through your comments, but I just want to speak to that a little bit more specifically, if we can. And then subsequently, on the origination side, obviously, well down again. How do you think about the -- just the elevated energy price backdrop that we're seeing today? How quickly is that fomenting sort of a reinvigorated demand backdrop? And when could that materialize as you think about the backdrop in the '23, '24 backdrop or beyond?
Rebecca J. Kujawa: Thank you, Julien. I appreciate the questions, and good morning. As you even prefaced in your set of questions, we're pretty excited about the opportunities for both of the major businesses, both Florida Power & Light and Energy Resources. And specifically on the renewable side and Energy Resources, the team just had an awesome origination quarter, and that's kind of on the heels of other awesome origination quarters going back now for quite some time, setting us up for tremendous growth in the coming years. So in terms of demand backdrop, to kind of answer the second question first, it's terrific, and we're really excited about the value proposition of renewables looking forward, both in terms of being low cost and the ability to decarbonize both the electricity sector and other sectors as we've talked about. It's been an exciting 18 months for our integrated supply chain and engineering construction teams. Lots of opportunities to navigate uncertainties, likes of which we and the industry probably haven't seen in quite some time. And it's also in the midst of enormous growth for us, a record year of renewables deployment last year and another terrific capital deployment year this year, so both growth and opportunities to show what we can do. It's good to be us. I mean, we've highlighted that in the past in the sense of being large in this industry, having significant capital dollars to put to work, enables us to have strong relationships and extensive relationships with those in the supply chain to help navigate these uncertainties. We feel good about our ability to navigate them. The plan does get iterated from time to time as the circumstances change, but we feel good about the long-term view for renewables and our ability to deliver on our expectations.
James L. Robo: Hey, Julien. Just --
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Go ahead, Jim.
James L. Robo: The only thing I'd add is I think people don't really appreciate the 10-year strip is up $1 since January. It's hugely positive for the renewable business, enormously positive, right? So --
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead with your question.
Steve Fleishman: Thanks and good morning. Just could you maybe just give the name of the -- who the counterparty is for the green hydrogen project?
Rebecca J. Kujawa: Yes, prefer not to, Steve. We're obviously really excited about the opportunity to supply them and provide this energy, and we think it is a great start to the hydrogen economy. But we'll leave that discussion for a later date.
Steve Fleishman: Okay. And then just on the -- a different way to ask the supply chain question. Just within your -- obviously, you had a lot to your backlog. If you look at the existing backlog, did anything move around meaningfully between years --
Rebecca J. Kujawa: Not meaningfully.
Steve Fleishman: In the backlog?
Rebecca J. Kujawa: I appreciate the question. No, nothing that I would consider to be meaningful at all. There's a couple of projects that moved out and a couple of projects that moved in, in terms of time frames, but very much consistent with our expectations. And as I highlighted at a very high level in response to Julien's question, we feel good about our plans of bringing in the projects we expect to bring into service in 2021 and have good line of sight for executing on the development plans thereafter.
Steve Fleishman: Okay. And then last question, just obviously, I have to ask about the DC and the proposed clean energy credits and the reconciliation, etc., maybe just latest thoughts on what's most important to you and the likelihood and path to passage, how you're feeling about it?
James L. Robo: So Steve, it's Jim. I would say that we remain cautiously optimistic that something happens on that front. I think I said earlier, if there is a reconciliation bill, I would be shocked if there isn't a long-term extension of the credits embedded in that. And I think that's reasonably high odds if the Democrats can come to terms among themselves around what would be in the reconciliation bill. And that's not an easy -- as we've seen play out over the last several weeks, that's not an easy -- that's not easy and there's, obviously, within that, that caught us [Phonetic] a lot of varying views across the board. But I think -- so I remain cautiously optimistic that something happens there. And then if something happens there, we feel good about the fact that there will be a long-term extension of the credits and that there will be support for other types of clean energy such as hydrogen, a stand-alone storage ITC, etc. So, yes, it would be very constructive for us. We think it's an important part of the decarbonization of the US economy to accelerate that. And I mean, we've increasingly -- as we think about our own strategy going forward, we're increasingly thinking about ourselves as the company that's going to lead not only the clean energy transformation of the electric grid, but really the clean energy transformation of the US economy and the decarbonization of the US economy because the electric grid is going to be the key to decarbonizing the transport sector, it's going to be the key to decarbonizing the industrial sector. And so we're really positioning ourselves to be the leader there and I feel very good about both the policy tailwinds that we have as well as how our business is executing along those goals.
Steve Fleishman: And I'm sorry, just one follow-up. The -- this wind project for green hydrogen, is it -- does it depend on the hydrogen PTC passing? Or does it happen either way?
Rebecca J. Kujawa: No, it's a contract with the customer irrespective of any sort of subsequent policy changes.
Steve Fleishman: Great. Thank you very much.
Rebecca J. Kujawa: Thank you, Steve.
Operator: Our next question comes from Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead with your question.
Shar Pourreza: Hey, good morning guys.
Rebecca J. Kujawa: Good morning, Shar.
Shar Pourreza: Look, I just wanted to maybe just drill down a little bit more on the backlog there. Can you just maybe talk a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of the higher input costs for projects? I mean, we've seen some headwinds from developers and manufacturers recently on the labor, steel, transportation, etc. What do you -- and we're hearing some commercial and utility scale projects are being pushed out. What are you seeing -- are you seeing any impact to the project economics, especially for the ones that are marginal? Is anyone kind of with signed contracts maybe bulking, especially if the PPA terms are somewhat flexible as we think about when a shovel needs to be put in the ground? So you're not seeing it right now, but is there any inkling on potential projects potentially being shifted out as buyers wait for some input cost relief?
Rebecca J. Kujawa: Shar, I'm not sure I'm following completely the question. Are you asking whether or not there are other projects -- not our projects, but other projects that might be experiencing those? Or are you asking for us? Because I wasn't sure who the buyers were in that -- in your question.
Shar Pourreza: Sorry, specifically for your projects.
Rebecca J. Kujawa: We are not having any -- anything notable from a buyer perspective. And from our customers' perspective, we have a contract, and we are expecting to execute against what's laid out in those contracts. And from a supply chain standpoint, I think, we're very well positioned to navigate these uncertainties. And as I highlighted, line of sight of bringing out the projects that we intend to bring in in '21 into service and have great plans for executing against our '22 development program. And obviously, beyond that, one, there's a lot still to be seen as to what those conditions will ultimately be because now we're talking two-plus years out. But a great team and a great position in the industry to be able to navigate those. From a customer standpoint, we're continuing to see strong demand for new renewables. I think that's obvious from the contract signings that we were able to announce today, and John and his team have terrific backlog beyond that of opportunities that we have yet to sign and the team is really excited about being out in the field and talking with our customers. It is just a terrific time for renewables in our industry.
Shar Pourreza: Got it. Thank you for that. Thanks for the elaboration. Maybe just quickly shifting to the regulated utility, just wondering also how much more headroom from incremental O&M efficiencies do you still anticipate from the legacy Gulf asset? And how is that sort of headroom impacted from the recent run-up in commodity costs, mainly natural gas, right? So a bit of an efficiency and bill headroom question embedded there.
Rebecca J. Kujawa: Sure, Shar. And obviously, we continue to work diligently at now what's going to be FPL going forward, particularly assuming the settlement agreement is approved next week by the commission, Gulf will be fully incorporated into the broader FPL enterprise. It largely is today, but obviously, from a regulatory standpoint, operates separately at least through the end of this year. We think there are continued opportunities to focus on optimization across the businesses. That's part of what we do as a company, is look for those opportunities to take opportunities to bring efficiencies to the business, and of course, invest capital to take cost out and lower fuel costs over time. One of the great ways that FPL, and that includes Gulf as part of it, will be to continue to deploy solar over the long term, because as you all well know, not only does it have the clean energy benefits, but it has low operating costs and no fuel costs, which will be a great offset in diversification in the state of Florida from our existing generation set. So I think there's continued opportunities. There's still a lot of work to be done. We focus hard on that every day and we think the team is all the cards in the hand to be able to continue executing.
Shar Pourreza: Got it. So I guess, just not to paraphrase, but the recent jump in gas, and obviously, Jim highlighted the move in the forwards, that shouldn't really impact sort of the bill headroom just given the other leverage you have at the business?
Rebecca J. Kujawa: Yes. So Shar, I would think if you look back at where we have taken the opportunity to invest capital historically, it really is on bringing long-term value to our customers. So being able to deliver lower cost over time, higher reliability, greater resilience, greater diversification and those clean energy benefits, and it would be short-sighted to stop investing in opportunities that are really clearly good for customers. We're very mindful of customer bills. You hear that from us from every day -- in all of our communications and it's what we focus on day to day, is making sure we have a terrific value proposition for our customers, and we will do everything we can to moderate those impacts over time.
Shar Pourreza: Terrific. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.
Rebecca J. Kujawa: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.
Michael Lapides: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question. I have one or two here. First of all, the water and wastewater utility system acquisitions in Texas, can you talk about just the size and scale of the capital you're employing there for that? And then more long-term, kind of more strategic, how do you think about the opportunity for growth in that business? Is it more organic? Is it more kind of continuing to roll up neighboring systems? Or are you thinking about a national strategy here?
Rebecca J. Kujawa: Hey, Michael, and good morning, and thanks for the question. We did include in the prepared remarks, the comment about the $45 million, and that $45 million includes both the acquisition of the regulated utility assets as well as that innovative water reuse and reclamation project that we talked about it also on Energy Resources. So in terms of our capital program, investing $15 billion a year and more over time, it's pretty small. But we referenced it for a good reason, and that's because we're excited about the opportunities. I think it's a lot like transmission in the sense that it will be built slowly over time and create opportunities for us to continue to have that regulated and long-term contracted base of value creation for shareholders. On the other part, the kind of innovative use and reclamation project that we talked about on the Energy Resources side, those also bring clean energy renewable opportunities as we're able to bring this broad suite of clean energy and ESG focused investment opportunities for our commercial and industrial customers. That gives us the opportunity to have a deep relationship with them, not just bring one solution, but bring a portfolio of options to them. So we think it's a terrific opportunity for Energy Resources team to develop those meaningful relationships with our customers. So it's both an investment and a strategic opportunity from our perspective.
Michael Lapides: Got it. And then one question on Seabrook, and I know in the grand scheme of its [Phonetic] earnings power, Seabrook, while it's a large plant, is nowhere near the biggest contributor of that. But just curious, how should we think about how much you financially hedge Seabrook? I'm just thinking about given the move in forward power prices, and Jim referenced the move in natural gas dollar increase in the strip, how we should think about whether Seabrook actually benefits from that materially or had you already significantly hedged it out prior?
Rebecca J. Kujawa: Yes. So we have an ongoing hedging program that we execute ratably over time, executing a percentage of Seabrook's forward generation. So I would characterize it as pretty well hedged in the next couple of years. And then as you get out into the latter part of the 2020s and into the 2030s and beyond, less so. So it obviously would benefit that -- if you mark-to-market that forward position, clearly, there's been some upside with the increase in natural gas prices and some of the congestion you've seen in the Northeast in terms of electricity prices. Whether that lasts in the long term, I think, remains to be seen, but certainly an opportunity for Seabrook. We continue to believe Seabrook is very well placed. It is in a particularly advantageous load zone. It's obviously in a region that values clean energy deeply. And you think about broad decarbonization in any part of the US, including the Northeast, well-positioned nuclear assets will be a key part of making that happen. So we very much appreciate the -- our nuclear team and think they do a terrific job every day and Seabrook is a key part of that.
Michael Lapides: Got it. Thank you. Much appreciated.
Rebecca J. Kujawa: Thank you, Michael.
Operator: Our next question comes from Maheep Mandloi from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.
Maheep Mandloi: Hey, thanks for taking the question. Two on NEP actually. One on the multiple for the acquisition comes out around 11 times EBITDA versus the 9 times we saw for the prior two acquisitions, so job done. I just want to understand, has that been new normal you're seeing for asset acquisitions or anything specific to these projects? And just the second one on the 2022 CAFD walk, just want to confirm if it includes any repayment for the first BlackRock CEPF closed in 2018. Thanks.
Rebecca J. Kujawa: So I'll come back to the second question. In terms of the transaction, as we highlighted, it was a third-party transaction, so it reflects a negotiated outcome. And we continue to believe that the renewable sector remains of high interest for a lot of folks and expect it to be competitive over time. But I think you can see with this transaction and with a prior third-party transaction that we announced and closed earlier this year, there are some specific advantages that NextEra Energy Partners has, both in its ability to find attractive financing, but also the relationship it has with NextEra Energy Resources of being able to add value on the operating side and bring to bear all of the scale benefits that we have. So in terms of the second part of the question, I think you were asking about the 2018 CEPF, and ultimately, the conversion that will happen in the very latter part of this year. And we're still -- obviously, some significant part of that gets converted up to 70% of it in NEP units and the balance is paid in cash. And we are still working through what the full impacts are and how we will finance that over time. But as we've laid out in terms of our run rate expectations, we will expect that year-end '22 to be in the ranges that we outlined today.
Maheep Mandloi: Got it now. Thanks for taking the questions.
Rebecca J. Kujawa: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Durgesh Chopra from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead with your question.
Durgesh Chopra: Hey, good morning, team. Thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to go back to the water utility acquisition strategy a bit. Obviously, this is in Texas, but there's obviously a ton of small municipal systems across the country, which are sort of owned by small mom-and-pop type facilities. Just are you going to sort of be more aggressive throughout the country? Or is there something specific about taxes as we think about you sort of competing for these small water utility systems?
Rebecca J. Kujawa: Yes, I think it's a great question. As we've highlighted -- I highlighted, obviously, in the prepared remarks, and Jim has highlighted elsewhere in recent months, we're really excited about building a significant presence in the water business. And we think there's a lot of skills and capabilities, and of course, the broad platform we have that we could bring real value in these acquisitions. But as you highlighted, they tend to be very small, and whether they're privately owned or owned by municipalities, almost irregardless of the ownership structure, they tend to be small. Even the one I talked about today is incorporated with something else, and it totals up $45 million in context of our $15 billion capital program. So I expect us to be active. There's probably some regions of the US, where the team in the near term, will be more active than others for a variety of reasons, but it's probably not exclusively Texas and it will build over time. And we'll let you know if the team continues to have success.
Durgesh Chopra: Understood. Thank you for the time.
Rebecca J. Kujawa: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.
Jeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning.
Rebecca J. Kujawa: Good morning.
Jeremy Tonet: Thanks. Just want to pivot back to hydrogen for a minute, if we could here. And just want to see on what timeline do you see green hydrogen being competitive? And how much money is NEE currently spending on hydrogen -- hydrogen projects, and where could that ramp to over time?
Rebecca J. Kujawa: I think it's a great question. I think in the electricity sector, when it's going to be particularly relevant is the latter part of the 2020s into 2030s and beyond. And for the key reason for that being that you really need to have the need for long-duration storage, and it is particularly attractive when you have very, very low cost energy input, and particularly, low cost renewables, which will inevitably have when you have substantial renewable deployment, again, probably in the latter part of the 2020s and beyond. What may be different is in the transportation and industrial sector, where there's already built-in use of gray hydrogen and other fossil fuels that could be supplanted with green hydrogen when it's competitive. The big question mark would be whether or not there's a hydrogen production tax credit ultimately in the final reconciliation bill. Clearly, there's one anticipated today, and at $3 a kilogram production tax credit, that really closes the gap between gray hydrogen and green hydrogen alternatives. And so that's a terrific opportunity to see growth in the near term, and what that would represent is using green hydrogen alternatives to supplant gray hydrogen. From our perspective, that opportunity is clearly to build a lot of renewables and you saw the first step in that direction in our announcement today about a power purchase agreement that we've entered into. But there would be more -- a lot more like that in not just the renewable side, but also an opportunity for us to invest in the actual hydrogen production equipment such as the electrolyzer. So we'll see. We'll know a lot more in January once we've seen the final package, if there is one, as Jim highlighted and it will develop over time in terms of opportunities. We think it's exceptionally likely. It's really just a matter of timing.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. That's very helpful. And then maybe just pivoting over real quick toward transmission, obviously, to optimize and maximize renewables deployment for the country, transmission build-out is a key ingredient there. Yet it's -- as you well know, it's difficult and timely to complete. Just wondering, I guess, your latest thoughts on what expectations you might have for transmission build-out and what role NEE could play there?
Rebecca J. Kujawa: Yes. We're really excited about transmission opportunities. Our NextEra Energy Transmission team has built a terrific business over the last decade with a number of organic wins as well as some acquisitions, as we've talked about in the past of, not only Trans Bay Cable, but GridLiance more recently, and we see a ton of opportunities going forward for us to be successful in winning some of those big opportunities to invest, realizing great returns, but also the strategic side of it of ensuring that it happens so that we can continue to realize the substantial renewables build-out that we already are seeing, and we expect to only continue to grow in this opportunity size over time. It may not be imperative today to have new transmission, but it's really, really important to start today because it will be imperative in the next decade and some of the policy considerations that FERC is undertaking today could be helpful to bringing that to reality over time.
Jeremy Tonet: Great. Thank you so much for the color.
Rebecca J. Kujawa: Great. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Closing Remarks]

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-07-23 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning everyone. And welcome to the NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners Q2, 2021 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Please also note today's event is being recorded. And at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jessica Aldridge, Director of Investor Relations. Ma'am, please go ahead.
Jessica Aldridge: Thank you, Jamie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our second quarter 2021 combined earnings conference call for NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. With me this morning are Jim Robo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; Rebecca Kujawa, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; John Ketchum, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources; and Mark Hickson, Executive Vice President of NextEra Energy. All of whom are also officers of NextEra Energy Partners as well as Eric Silagy, President and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power and Light Company. Rebecca will provide an overview of our results and our executive team will then be available to answer your questions. We will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release, in the comments made during this conference call, in the risk factors section of the accompanying presentation or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found on our websites, nexteraenergy.com and nexteraenergypartners.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. Today's presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of historical non-GAAP measures to the closest GAAP financial measure. As a reminder, Gulf Power legally merged into Florida Power & Light Company effective on January 1, 2021. Gulf Power will continue as a separate reporting segment within Florida Power & Light and NextEra Energy through 2021, serving its existing customers under separate retail rates. Throughout today's presentation when we refer to FPL, we are referring to Florida Power & Light excluding Gulf Power, unless otherwise noted, or when using the term combined. With that, I will turn the call over to Rebecca.
Rebecca Kujawa: Thank you, Jessica. And good morning everyone. NextEra Energy delivered strong second quarter results and is well positioned to meet its overall objectives for the year. Adjusted earnings per share increased more than 9% year-over-year reflecting continued strong financial and operational performance across all of the businesses. FPL increased earnings per share by $0.04 year-over-year driven by continued investments in the business. FPL's major capital initiatives remain on track and FPL's focus continues to be on identifying smart capital investments to lower costs, improve reliability and provide clean energy solutions for the benefit of our customers. In June, FPL demolished its last coal fired plant in Florida with plans to replace it with more clean emissions free solar energy facilities. During the quarter, FPL also successfully commissioned approximately 373 megawatts of new solar, including the FPL Discovery Solar Energy Center at Kennedy Space Center. With these new additions FPL surpassed 40% completion of its groundbreaking 30 by 30 plan to install 30 million solar panels by 2030. FPL expects to have installed more than 15 million panels by early 2022, which would put the company more than 50% on the way towards completing a 30 by 30 plan. And just over three years since the initial announcement. To support its solar build out, FPL recently began installing the first components of the world's largest integrated solar powered battery system. The 409 megawatt FPL Manatee Energy Storage Center which expected to begin serving customers later this year. Gulf Power also continued to execute on its growth initiatives during the quarter with its strong financial performance driven primarily by continued investment in the business and further improvements in operational cost effectiveness. Excluding the COVID-19 related expenses which were subsequent reversed and booked into a regulatory asset in the third quarter of 2020, Gulf Power's year-to-date O&M costs declined by approximately 9% versus the prior year comparable period, and have now declined by approximately 31% relative to 2018. Gulf Power's operational performance metrics also continue to improve with reliability of the generation fleet that we operate, and service reliability improving by 71% and 63% respectively, year-to-date versus the first half of 2018. We continue to expect the cost reduction initiatives and smart capital investments that we've previously outlined will generate significant customer and shareholder value in the coming years. At Energy Resources, adjusted earnings per share increased by more than 7% year-over-year. The energy resources team continues to capitalize on the terrific market opportunity for low cost renewables and storage, adding approximately 1840 megawatts to its backlog since the last earnings call. This continued origination success is a testament to Energy Resources' significant competitive advantages, including our large pipeline of sites and interconnection queue positions, strong customer relationships, purchasing power and supply chain execution, best-in-class construction expertise, resource assessment capabilities, cost of capital advantages, and world class operations capability. Moreover, Energy Resources Advanced Data analytics and machine learning capabilities allow us to utilize the nearly 40 billion operating data points our fleet provides every single day for predictive modeling, further extending our best-in-class O&M and development capabilities. We continue to believe that no company is better positioned than Energy Resources to capitalize on the best renewables development period in our history. We are pleased with the progress we've made at NextEra Energy so far in 2021. And headed into the second half of the year, we are well positioned to achieve the full year financial expectations that we've previously discussed, subject to our usual caveats. Now let's look at the detailed results beginning with FPL. For the second quarter of 2021, FPL reported net income of $819 million or $0.42 per share, which is an increase of $70 million and $0.04 per share, respectively year-over-year. Regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 10.7% over the same quarter last year, and was the principal driver of FPL's net income growth of more than 9%. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $1.6 billion in the second quarter, and we expect our full year capital investments to total between $6.6 billion and $6.8 billion. Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.6% for the 12 months ended June 2021. During the quarter, we utilized $100 million of reserve amortization to achieve our target regulatory ROE leaving FPL with a balance of $473 million. As a reminder, rather than seek recovery from customers of the approximately $240 million in hurricane Dorian storm restoration costs, in 2019, FPL utilized its available reserve amortization to offset nearly all of the expense associated with the write-off of the regulatory assets related to Dorian cost recovery. Earlier in the year FPL and Office of Public council entered into a settlement regarding the prudence of FPL’s hurricane Dorian storm restoration costs and activities, which was approved by the Florida Public Service Commission in May.  We were pleased by the Commission's determination that all of FPL hurricane Dorian restoration costs were prudently incurred, and we believe the settlement agreement fairly and reasonably balances the interests of FPL and its customers. Earlier this month, FPL responded to tropical storm Elsa, with a restoration workforce of approximately 7,000 FPL employees and contractors. FPL safely and quickly restored power to nearly 100,000 customers who were impacted by Elsa as the hardening and automation investments that FPL has made since 2006 to build a stronger, smarter and more storm resilient energy grid continued to benefit customers. Elsa was the earliest that a fifth named storm has formed in the Atlantic basin. And we remain prepared in advance of what is forecasted to be another active hurricane season in 2021. Let me now turn to Gulf Power, which reported second quarter 2021 net income of $63 million or $0.03 per share. During the quarter Gulf Power's capital expenditures were approximately $150 million and we expected full year capital investments to be between $800 million and $900 million. All of the major capital with the Gulf Power capital projects, including the North Florida resiliency connection that is expected to be in service in mid 2022 continue to progress well and Gulf Power's regulatory capital employed grew by approximately 17% year-over-year as a result of these smart capital investments for the benefit of customers. Gulf Power's reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 10.3% for the 12 months ended June 2021. For the full year 2021, we continue to target a regulatory ROE in the upper half of the allowed band of 9.25% to 11.25%. Earlier this month, Florida Public Service Commission also approved a settlement agreement between Gulf Power and the Office of Public Council for cost recovery of the approximately $13 million in COVID-19 related expenses, primarily reflected in incremental bad debt and safety expenses as a result of the pandemic. We are pleased with this outcome and believe it demonstrates the continued constructive regulatory environment in the state of Florida, as we work to improve Gulf Power's customer value proposition of low costs, high reliability, excellent customer service and clean energy for our customers. As we anticipated, Florida's economic activity has rebounded since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic last year, as reflected by a wide range of positive economic indicators. Florida's current unemployment rate is 5%, which remains well below the national average. Rolling three month average of new building permits are up approximately 46% year-over-year, which is the highest growth rate in nearly eight years, and are the second highest new building permits in the nation. As another indicator of health in Florida's economy, Florida's retail sales index was up over 40% versus the prior year. The Case-Shiller seasonally adjusted index for South Florida home prices is up over 14% on an annual basis. Recent population growth estimates indicate that Florida remains one of the top destinations for relocating Americans, with Florida adding nearly 330,000 new residents between April of 2020 and April of 2021. We expect this trend to continue, with Florida's population projected to grow at an average annual rate of 1% through 2023 and FPL, including Gulf Power forecasts adding almost 500,000 new customer accounts from 2018 through 2025. During the quarter, FPL's average number of customers increased by approximately 70,400 from the comparable prior year quarter, driven by continued solid underlying population growth. FPL's second quarter retail sales increased 2.1% from the prior year comparable period. Partially offsetting customer growth was a decline in weather related usage per customer of approximately 2.8%. On weather normalized basis, second quarter sales increased 2.9% with continued strong underlying usage contributing favorably. For Gulf Power the average number of customers grew roughly 1.5% versus the comparable prior year quarter, and Gulf Power's second quarter retail sales decreased 1% year-over-year, as strong customer growth was more than offset by an unfavorable weather comparison relative to 2020. As we previously stated on March 12, we initiated Florida Power and Light 2021 base rate proceeding. The four year base rate plan we have proposed has been designed to support continued investments in clean energy generation, long-term infrastructure and advanced technology, which improves reliability and keeps customer bills low. Today FPL typical residential bills remain well below the national average and the lowest among the top 20 investor owned utilities in the nation. With a proposed base rate adjustments and current projections for fuel and other costs, FPL's typical residential bill is expected to be approximately 20% below the projected national average, and typical Gulf Power residential bills are projected to decrease approximately 1% over the four year rate plan. As always we are open to the possibility of resolving our rate request through our fair settlement agreement. And our core focus remains on pursuing a fair and objective review of our case that supports continued execution of our successful strategy for customers. Energy Resources reported second quarter 2021 GAAP losses of $315 million or $0.16 per share. Adjusted earnings for the second quarter were $574 million or $0.29 per share. Energy Resources adjusted earnings per share in the second quarter increased more than 7% versus the prior year comparable period. The effect of mark-to-market on non-qualifying hedges which is excluded from adjusted earnings was the primary driver of the difference between Energy Resources' second quarter GAAP and adjusted earnings results. Contributions from new investments added $0.04 per share versus the prior year and primarily reflect growth in our contract of renewables and battery storage program. Adjusted earnings per share contributions from existing generation and storage assets increased $0.01 year-over-year, which includes the impact of unfavorable wind resource during second quarter. NextEra Transmissions adjusted earnings per share contribution also increased $0.01 year-over-year. Our customer supply and trading business contribution was $0.3 lower year-over-year primarily due to unfavorable market conditions. All other impacts decreased results by $0.01 per share versus 2020. The Energy Resources Development team continues to capitalize on what we believe is the best renewables development environment in our history during the second quarter, with a team adding approximately 1,840 megawatts of renewables and storage projects to our backlog. Since our last earnings call, we've added approximately 285 megawatts of new wind and wind repowering, 1,450 megawatts of solar and 105 megawatts of battery storage to our backlog assign contracts. With nearly 3.5 years remaining before the end of 2024, we have already signed more than 75% of the megawatts needed to realize the low end of our 2021 to 2024 development expectations range. Since the last call, we have also executed a 310 megawatt build own transfer agreement which is not included in our backlog additions. Our customer intends to use this solar-plus-storage project to replace existing coal generation. And we are excited to be able to continue supporting the industry's transition away from old inefficient forms of generation into clean, reliable and low cost renewables and storage. Our engineering and construction team continues to perform exceptionally well commissioning approximately 330 megawatts during the quarter and keeping the backlog of wind, solar and storage projects that we expect to build in 2021 and 2022 on track. We are well positioned to complete our more than $20 billion capital investment program at Energy Resources for 2021 and 2022. Last month, the IRS extended safe harbor eligibility on production tax credits and investment tax credits. Providing projects that began construction between 2016 and 2019 with six years to complete construction and projects that started construction in 2020 with five years to achieve their in service dates and qualify for federal tax credits. We believe the extension reflects the strong support of the Biden administration for new renewables and may enable an incremental 1 to 1.5 gigawatts of new wind and wind repowering opportunities. We now have more than $2.2 billion of safe harbor wind and solar equipment, which could support as much as $45 billion of wind, solar and battery storage investments across all of our businesses from 2021 to 2024. Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy; for the second quarter of 2021, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $256 million or $0.13 per share. NextEra Energy's 2021 second quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $1.4 billion and $0.71 cents per share respectively. Adjusted earnings from corporate and other segment were roughly flat year-over-year. Over the past few months NextEra Energy issued nearly $3.3 billion in new financings under its innovative new NextEra Green bond structure. Funds raised with NextEra Energy green bonds are designated for specific renewable energy and storage projects under development across our businesses. And if funds are not used to bring the renewable projects online within two years, there was a step up in the interest rate on the debt. Our inaugural NextEra Green issuance was 4.5x oversubscribed, priced at a premium to the market and was well received by investors.  We believe that NextEra Green will set a new standard for green issuances moving forward. NextEra Energy has raised more than $9 billion in new capital year-to-date on very favorable terms as we continue to execute on our financing plan for the year. Finally, in June, S&P affirmed all of its ratings for NextEra Energy and lowered its downgrade threshold for its Funds From Operation or FFO to debt metric, from the previous level of 21% to the new level of 20%. We believe this favorable adjustment reflects the strength of our business, as well as recognition of NextEra Energy's leading position in the utility and renewable energy sectors on environmental, social and governance or ESG factors. We believe this is the first time that S&P has formally recognized the benefits to business risk profile related to ESG factors by allowing more constructive financial metrics since it began its practice of identifying the specific ESG key metrics that drive a company's overall credit position. Notably, S&P also revised NextEra Energy's management and governance assessment, from satisfactory to strong to reflect its views on our comprehensive enterprise wide risk management standards, and successful track record of consistently implementing our strategic planning efforts.  Our long-term financial expectations through 2023 remain unchanged. For 2021 NextEra Energy expects adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.40 to $2.54. For 2022, and 2023, NextEra Energy expects to grow 6% to 8% off of the expected 2021 adjusted earnings per share. And we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of these ranges in 2021, 2022, and 2023, while at the same time maintaining strong credit ratings. From 2018 to 2023, we continue to expect that operating cash flow will grow roughly in line with our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. We also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at roughly 10% rate per year to at least 2022 off of a 2020 base. As always, our expectations assume normal weather and operating conditions. Let me now turn to an NextEra Energy Partners, NextEra Energy Partners portfolio performed well and deliver financial results are generally in line with our expectations after accounting for the below average renewable resource. On a year-to-date basis, adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution have increased by roughly 9% and 11%, respectively, versus 2020. This strong operational and financial performance highlights the NextEra Energy Partners remains well positioned to continue to deliver on its outstanding growth objectives. Yesterday, the NextEra Energy Partners' board declared a quarterly distribution $0.6625 per common unit or $2.65 per common unit on an annualized basis, up approximately 15% from a year earlier. Inclusive of this increase NextEra Energy Partners has now grown its distribution per unit by more than 250% since the IPO.  Further building on that strength, today we are announcing the NextEra Energy Partners has entered into an agreement to acquire approximately 590 net megawatts of geographically diverse wind and solar projects from NextEra Energy Resources. I'll provide additional details on the transaction in a few minutes. NextEra Energy Partners also completed multiple financing during second quarter to secure funding for its recently announced 2021 acquisitions and further enhance its financing flexibility. In June, NextEra Energy Partners raised approximately $500 million in new 0% coupon convertible notes and concurrently entered into a capped call structure that is expected to result in NextEra Energy Partners retaining the upside from up to 50% appreciation in its unit price over the three years associated with a convertible notes. NextEra Energy Partners also drew the remaining funds from its 2020 convertible equity portfolio financing, which was upsized by approximately $150 million during the quarter evidencing continued investor demand for exposure to the high quality long term contract of renewables projects and the underlying portfolio of assets that was established last year. Finally, NextEra Energy Partners has successfully completed the sale of approximately 700,000 NEP common units year-to-date through its recently expired at the market or ATM program, raising roughly $50 million in proceeds. Going forward, we will continue to seek opportunities to use the ATM program depending on market conditions and other considerations. And in the near term NextEra Energy Partners intends to renew the program for up to $300 million in issuances over the next three years to permit additional financing flexibility. As a result of these financings, and the strong cash flow generation of its existing portfolio, NextEra Energy Partners ended the quarter with more than $2.2 billion in liquidity, which includes funds raised in second quarter financing activities and existing partnership debt capacity to support its ongoing growth initiatives, including the acquisition of the approximately 599 megawatts of renewables from Energy Resources, as well as previously announced acquisition of approximately 400 megawatts of operating wind projects, both of which are expected to close later this year. Let me now review the detailed results for NextEra Energy Partners. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA $350 million was roughly flat versus the prior year comparable quarter driven by favorable contributions from the approximately 500 megawatts of new wind and solar projects acquired in 2020. Weaker wind and solar resource in this second quarter, which reduced this quarters adjusted EBITDA contribution from existing projects by roughly $22 million was partially offset by positive contributions to adjusted EBITDA from last year's repowering and the Texas pipelines. Wind resource for the quarter was 93% of the long-term average versus 100% in the second quarter of 2020. Cash available for distribution of $151 million for the second quarter was also reduced for existing projects due to the distributions for the convertible equity portfolio financing entered into late last year. As a reminder, this convertible equity portfolio financing recapitalize NextEra Energy Partners' existing Genesis solar project and other assets, and the proceeds were used to fund last year's acquisition from Energy Resources. Additional details of our second quarter results are shown on the accompanying slide. We remain on track for the strong full year growth consistent with our long-term growth objectives of 12% to 15% distributions per unit growth through at least 2024. As I previously mentioned, we continue to execute on our plan to expand NextEra Energy Partners' portfolio with an agreement to acquire assets in a diverse portfolio of long-term contracted wind and solar projects from Energy Resources. The portfolio consists of approximately 830 megawatts of renewables, of which NextEra Energy Partners will be acquiring an approximately 590 megawatt net interest. NextEra Energy Partners' interest in the portfolio will consist of approximately 510 megawatts of universal scale wind and solar projects, and approximately 80 megawatts of distributed solar projects, which is NextEra Energy Partners' first acquisition of distributed generation assets. The portfolio to be acquired by NextEra Energy Partners has a cash available for distribution weighted average contract life of approximately 17 years and a counterparty credit rating of Baa1 at Moody's and BBB at S&P. Additional details on the portfolio of assets to be acquired by NextEra Energy Partners can be found in the appendix of today's presentation. Energy Resources currently owns the country's largest portfolio of distributed generation assets with commercial and industrial customers, and expects to triple its capital investment and distributed generation from 2020 through 2020. NextEra Energy Partners expects to benefit from this expansion over the coming years through future acquisitions from Energy Resources. NextEra Energy Partners expects to acquire the portfolio for a total consideration of $563 million subject to working capital and other adjustments. NextEra Energy Partners' share of the portfolio's debt and tax equity financings is estimated to be approximately $270 million at the time of closing. The acquisition is expected to contribute adjusted EBITDA of approximately $90 million to $100 million, and cash available for distribution of approximately $41 million to $49 million, each on five year average annual run rate basis beginning on December 31 2021. The purchase price for the transaction is expected to be funded with existing liquidity, and the transaction is expected to close prior to year end and be immediately accretive to LP distributions.  NextEra Energy Partners continues to expect to be in the upper end of our previously disclosed year end 2021 run rate adjusted EBITDA and capped the expectation ranges of $1.44 billion to $1.62 billion and $600 million to $680 million, respectively. As a reminder, all of our expectations are subject to our normal caveats, and include the impact of anticipated IDR fees as we treat these as an operating expense. From the base of our fourth quarter 2020 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $2.46, we continue to see 12% to 15% growth per year in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2024. We expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2021 distribution that is payable in February of 2022, to be in the range of $2.76 to $2.83 per common unit. In summary, we remain as enthusiastic as ever about the long-term growth prospects for both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. At NextEra Energy we were honored to be named on Time magazine's first ever list of Top 100 most influential companies, which highlights businesses making an extraordinary impact around the world. We are proud to be leading the clean energy transformation in our sector and remained focused on executing upon the opportunities presented by the significant growth in wind, solar and various forms of energy storage in the US over the coming decades. At FPL, including Gulf Power, that means continuing to deliver on our best-in-class customer value proposition of low bills, high reliability and clean energy solutions. At Energy Resources, our competitive advantages, position as well to capture a meaningful share of the significant and expanding market for renewables. And at NextEra Energy Partners with its continued access to low cost capital, and accretive acquisition opportunities, is well positioned as ever to take advantage of the clean energy transformation, reshaping the energy industry. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we will open up the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners.
SharPourreza: Hey, good morning, guys. Just a question with sort of the infrastructure discussions going on at the federal level and obviously, Rebecca, you highlighted opportunities on the wind and solar side. Does NextEra transmissions sort of seeing the upside from policy changes? And obviously, with the prior acquisitions closed, do you feel like you have a big enough platform to grow organically or is there an interest to roll up more standalone projects development entities?
RebeccaKujawa: Yes, thanks, Shar. Appreciate the question. From our perspective, and we're looking out decades and looking at the enormous renewables build opportunity across the US. It is clear that over time new transmission needs to be built to support some of that build out. And it's not necessarily imperative today for that transmission to be built. But it certainly is important to start today to build the type of infrastructure that's needed over time. So we're really excited about the opportunities that the NextEra Energy Transmission team has. And I would expect over time that we will grow both organically and continue to look for acquisition opportunities, like we have over the last couple of years to supplement and build out that portfolio. We're thrilled with the Trans Bay Cable acquisition that we closed a couple of years ago, very excited to bring the GridLiance team on board and will continue to focus on opportunities, both organically and through acquisition over time.  From a broader policy standpoint, we saw that important for FERC the regional ISOs to continue to focus on how you support that transmission build out. And we certainly are happy to see that to start to be a focus at FERC this year in particular, and contemplating how do they support it going forward. And I think there's a receptive audience in the Biden administration, making sure that they support laying a foundation that supportive of renewables, not just in the next couple of years, but in the next couple of decades. So transmission moves slowly, you know that. So stay tuned. But we're optimistic both about our direct prospects in the near term as well as longer term.
SharPourreza: Got it. And then the backlog additions look obviously more solid this quarter. Just thinking about maybe the market dynamics, there was some slowdown in early '21 with input costs and commodity inflation, right. Have you seen that or are the headwinds largely stabilized? And just as a follow up, is energy storage, still kind of a large component of the backlog and contracted additions or has there been some pricing pressure there?
RebeccaKujawa: Our Energy Resources Development team clearly as evidenced by not only the signings this quarter, but looking back at quarters now going back quite a number of them have just had terrific origination success. And I've encouraged everybody to not just focus on an individual quarter and look at a slightly broader trend. And we're really pleased not only with what we've seen looking back and what the team has been able to execute on, but also looking forward. And that's what gave us the confidence just early this year, to not only increase but expand the horizon for our development expectations, such that our four year period starting '21 through '24 is 23 to 30 gigawatts, which is just an exceptional number and one that we're really excited and proud of the team for taking on and we're thrilled to be at 75% already at the low end today. In terms of our customer demand remains very strong across the board, and we're certainly excited about bringing that into more signed contracts going forward. In terms of costs, as you know, we'll continue to incorporate our latest expectations and industry's latest expectations for costs. And we feel very comfortable with the returns that we see and excited about the opportunities going forward. 
SharPourreza: Got it. And then just lastly, regarding just the rate case, I mean, obviously, you're having conversations with interveners and you're building a case record there and obviously highlighted you always prefer a settlement. Are there any moving pieces that you feel are in focus? And what do you sort of think you have some flexibility for a constructive kind of outcome versus a fully litigated case?
RebeccaKujawa: Shar, as we've talked about with you all, from an investor standpoint, we're very focused over years now leading up to the case as a matter of our strategy making sure that the best customer value proposition possible, and you can see that in our execution on O&M, or reliability on customer service. And, of course, the continued focused on clean energy generation, because that's in our control. What's also in our control is putting forward the best case possible to ensure that we're articulating that strategy, not only what the team has accomplished, but what we plan to do in the coming four years to support continued execution. So the team is very focused on continuing to go through the process. And culminating with the hearings, in short order and commission decision later this year if we go that far. But we're also always very interested in having a win-win solution with stakeholders. We certainly appreciate the history of that in Florida, not just with us, but with other utilities and broader stakeholder base. And we will continue to remain very engaged and any sort of constructive outcome that we could bring forward with stakeholders, we think that's positive for our customers and broader stakeholders, if we can accomplish it, but we're focused on the task at hand and we'll continue through the process and see where we are at the end of the year. 
SharPourreza: Perfect. Congrats guys on the results.
Operator: Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from BOA. 
JulienSmith: Excellent. Good morning, team. Thanks for the time. Maybe picking up where Shar left it off. Can you speak a little bit more about some of this inflation dynamic? And especially some of the elevated freight and logistics? I mean, it seems like your '21, '22 outlook here is relatively intact? Can you speak to some of the dynamics there in and just the competence? It seems like you guys are certainly staying on track of execution that you have historically. But also in the same vein of inflation, can you speak to what that does to your PPA offtake prices, right? I mean, how are you thinking about this being effectively passed through to your customers, if you will, whether that's as a proxy for higher gas and power prices, or simply just passing through your higher cost of goods here?
RebeccaKujawa: Yes, thanks, Julien. And I'll start with some kind of near term thoughts. And then think about the broader term second, near term, as we talked about in the prepared remarks, we feel very comfortable with where we are with our backlog and what we plan to build in the 2021 and 2022 timeframe. And our comments reflected that in the prepared remarks. And it's a real credit to the way that we approach this business, and our engineering, construction and integrated supply chain teams are really working through a variety of different circumstances over the last year and a half. And we've secured the equipment that we need to build out those projects and of course have some contractual agreements in place that help us feel comfortable about acquisition. From a longer term standpoint, I think it still remains to be seen in some respects. So you can see that in broad set of discussion across the financial and the broader US economy, dialogue of whether or not this is temporary related to near term snapbacks in demand and hurdles in the supply chain that may not persist over time, or if it is systemic and persisting. So I think that remains a little bit to be seen. One thing that's very fortunate for renewables, as you all well know, is that renewable energy projects are very much the least cost form of generation in many parts, if not most of parts of the US. So even if there is a change in pricing, if these cost increases are persistent and systemic over a long period of time, the value proposition is still very clear for renewables relative to alternatives. And then beyond that, we also need to think about what implications if any there will be from policy changes. So I think that the net takeaway is somewhat premised in your question is that we feel comfortable with where we are, we're prepared for a variety of set of circumstances. And we're thrilled with a position of renewables and the growth opportunities. And honestly, the decades ahead.
JohnKetchum: One small add, I would I would make to listen to what Rebecca just said. This is John; it's actually creating opportunities for us. Our supply chain capability and our ability to manage that supply chain, the buying power, that we have spent an $11 billion in CapEx a year, it's creating opportunities for us in the renewable space because we can execute deliver where others can't.
JulienSmith: I mean, to that point, can you speak to how much procurement you all have done against the full kind of full year outlook that you guys talk about here? I mean, how hedged up, for lack of a better way to describe this, are you against these eventualities? And I know you all do meaningful forward planning here.
JohnKetchum: Yes, pretty well hedged up Julien, I mean, we've basically locked in, obviously '21, we've locked in '22, making really good headway against '23, as well. And so that's put us in a great position, when you look at where we stand against the rest of the market, and where others can't deliver particularly around commitments in '22, or '23, or '24. Because they don't have the same supply chain leverage that we do. It's really creating opportunities in those out years. And you got to remember, the customers a little bit concerned. So if they're dealing with smaller players, that don't have the same supply chain leverage, that are having to constantly go back to them for price ups, or for COD extensions, it really lowers the credibility of those types of players and market, and it creates more opportunities that fall our way. And so that's why I say it's a real opportunity for us.
JulienSmith: Got it. And just to clarify that even further, or are you suggesting that not only could you get awarded future contracts, are you suggesting that you might be able to take over existing or perhaps the fund PPAS that have already been awarded?
JohnKetchum: Not take over. But if those opportunities fall away, because the off take where the customer can't arrange or workout with that developer. Sometimes those are -- those get bid back out to RFP or sometimes it creates a bilateral opportunity for us.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research.
SteveFleishman: Hey, good morning. Can you hear me Rebecca? Great. So first question on the announced backlog growth this quarter, lot of solar adds. But just a little bit of storage. Are you seeing, if I recall, you've been getting kind of 50% roughly adoption of storage with solar, is that changing? Just happened to be more just solar standalone weighted this quarter?
RebeccaKujawa: Yes, Steve, I wouldn't read into it. To kind of consistent with the overall backlog additions, I think you'd need to look a little bit broader in just a three month period to get an indication of trends. What we see is not a slowdown in storage at all, there's a lot of interest in new storage opportunities, not just with our customers, but even from a regulatory standpoint in certain jurisdictions where storage could be particularly helpful given certain dynamics in various markets. So we're very excited about the storage opportunity and don't see a change in the overall dynamics as of opportunities.
JohnKetchum: Yes, and one thing I would add to that Steve is, with all the hot weather that you're seeing out in the West, that's only going to drive more storage opportunity and I think we have a real competitive advantage as you seen the past in those markets.
SteveFleishman: Okay, great, and maybe just switching over to NEP. So this is the second drop, I think in the last six months or so, where the capped yields have been around 8% is that kind of the new range we should be expecting for NEP on drops of one term contracted asset.
RebeccaKujawa: Steve, you can appreciate we and of course, the NEP board and Energy Resources perspectives all constantly looking at what valuations are and where third party transactions have transacted and we think about the valuations in those light. And I think with where costs of capital are and demands for renewable projects, I think this transaction appropriately balances and reflects those dynamics.
SteveFleishman: Okay. And I guess last question just on any thoughts on some of the discussion in ERCOT, Texas on renewables on market structure changes, and then how they're discussing kind of treatment of renewables there. I mean is there a risk that renewables need to end up paying for ancillaries?
RebeccaKujawa: I would characterize it Steve as a work in progress. Obviously, the events that happened in February were pretty significant. And it takes time to work through and properly account for where there were sources of pressure and what the appropriate responses are, from obviously, from a political but of course, most probably from regulatory and a policy standpoint. And I think they're still sorting through it. Obviously, Governor Abbott has asked for certain actions to be taken for the PUCT and ERCOT. And there's a framework that the PUCT has started to lay out. But I think it's still time to work through what those details look like. From our perspective you know well, we've been very active in a variety of aspects in ERCOT, we know that market well. And we certainly have a strong perspective on what needs to be addressed in particular to focus on what really went wrong in February, including a massive amount of disruption across the gas supply, not only from supply, but transmission and ultimately, consumption by end users. And we hope that a lot of the actions will be focused on that, as opposed to things that that won't necessarily help and solve the fundamental problems at hand. But I think the most important part is work in progress.
JohnKetchum: Yes. And I think what I would add to that is trying to frame the problem, right, you have an 82 gigawatts system, I mean, renewables, let's face it, we're a very small part of that. On a MCF adjusted basis during your, you're talking about three gigawatts. And it really the way that to address the problem, if you're really going to go after the problem, you really have to focus on gas fired units, you have to focus on coal, you have to focus on nuclear. And you can't lose sight of the fact that the reason that ERCOT has low power prices, is because of renewables and renewables are what are really driving the efficiencies and the economics of that market. So there's a much bigger story to be told. That's what we're working through at the workshop level, as Rebecca said; this is going to take some time to play out.
Operator: Our next question comes from Stephen Byrd from Morgan Stanley.
StephenByrd: Hi, good morning. I wanted to talk about the outlook for renewable and energy storage costs. But take it from a different perspective. I know there's been a lot of attention on commodity cost dynamics. But on the more positive side, I was interested in your views on sort of innovations that could result in cost reduction breakthroughs. And there was an interesting article this week in the Wall Street Journal in storage. And we're trying to make sure we're thinking through potential areas of innovation. I was just curious at a high level, are there areas of innovation, whether it be in storage, or in solar, green hydrogen, just things that excite you in terms of the potential to have very significant impacts on cost or performance?
RebeccaKujawa: Well you know all of us, Steven, we love technology; we love innovation. And we certainly are excited about a lot of changes that are happening across the energy sector. I think the biggest driver dynamic in our sector today is really the cost of renewables overall, even today. And that alone is stimulating a significant amount of change. And that adoption over time, will create the need for more storage, like applications, whether it's lithium ion, or I think the technology you are referencing in the Wall Street Journal, of course, hydrogen in the longer term, which we're also very excited about. Those were all very interesting, particularly for the latter part of the 2020s and into 2030 and beyond, which could help support the substantial build up that we're expecting in the short term, I think the biggest dynamic is what we see at hand, which is the economic value proposition of renewables. What we think could change that probably near term than even some of the innovations you're talking about is policy. You all I know are following just like we are in participating in a variety of discussions in Washington. But if the incentives are addressed in legislation, that could be a big driver of change in the industry as well, in terms of timing.
StephenByrd: That's very helpful. And then I wanted to go back to the drop down that you announced, I was just curious, what was the amount of gains to NextEra from the drop down of assets down to NEP?
RebeccaKujawa: I'm not sure I understand the question, Stephen. Are you talking about the proceeds?
StephenByrd: Oh, well, the proceeds relative to the cost of developing, I was just curious sort of what degree of a premium NextEra was able to achieve relative to the costs of developing those assets?
RebeccaKujawa: We haven't disclosed that yet, Stephen, as we go through the process, of course, we will update the financial statements, assuming that the transaction closes. But we are very pleased from an Energy Resources perspective with these projects consistent overall returns with the types of returns that we see across wind and solar and distributed generation projects. On the DG side, we continue to be very excited about the business in Energy Resources; the team has done a terrific job building it. And as I commented in the prepared remarks, we're expecting to triple the investment that we've made in the business, and those tend to be very attractive returns.
StephenByrd: Understood, thanks. I was asking in part, I was just looking at the multiple of EBITDA and I mean, Steve Fleishman mentioned the cash capped yield that's 8%, it's not surprising, but the multiple EBITDA looked relatively low, but there may be some elements that I'm just missing.
RebeccaKujawa: I don't think, I wouldn't think it was characterized in anything unusual, Steven, we're happy with the overall returns of the project. And I do think that the capped yields are reflective of market transactions that we see in the marketplace and really reflective of substantial demand for renewables. And we've said continue to be very excited about the prospects for NEP.
Operator: Our next question comes from Maheep Mandloi from Credit Suisse.
MaheepMandloi: Hey, thanks for taking questions. Just following on the NEP side, the spread the drop downs, the adjusted EBITDA and CAFD guidance remains unchanged. Is that because of timing or something else on that side?
RebeccaKujawa: I'm sorry, was the guidance changed? What was the -- I missed that part?
MaheepMandloi: Sure. The adjusted EBITDA and CAFD guidance is the same as last quarter. Just wondering if the new drop downs are accretive on 2022 levels.
RebeccaKujawa: I understand now sorry about that. No, from our expectations, if you look at our guidance expectations, even at the end of last year, which is when we started talking about what the expectations for run rates at the end of this year, they were for an increase. This transaction was something that we were anticipating as part of our growth expectations. We do expect to be at the high end of the ranges as we've articulated for both adjusted EBITDA and CAFD for year end. 
MaheepMandloi: Got it. And in terms of additional drop downs, would this be comfortable for 2022 needs and it's a fair statement that you might need more drop downs for 2023 distribution growth?
RebeccaKujawa: We will continue to be opportunistic. There's a lot of flexibility within the NEP portfolio, we continue to have a pretty low payout ratio. If you recall, about a year and a half ago, we took some actions to disperse the lever but also supplement the portfolio during the uncertainty of the PG&E bankruptcy and continue to have a relatively low payout ratio. One of the advantages of that is NextEra Energy Partners can be opportunistic in terms of meeting its distribution per unit growth targets of 12% to 15%, which is really the metric against for really managing and measuring the business to ensure that we can meet those expectations. We provide the expectations for run rate adjusted EBITDA and CAFD to give a sense of how we're expecting to achieve them. But there is flexibility and how we get there.
MaheepMandloi: Got you. Thanks, Rebecca. Again, just maybe last one, for me. In terms of -- on the news development, and just given the recent cost pressures on the input side, just having that safe harbor helps meet any near term needs, as in are you using some of that $2.2 billion of safe harbor equipment upfront to avoid any higher costs in the near term.
RebeccaKujawa: There's a lot of flexibility inherent to that safe harbor portfolio, but we see it mostly as an option to create the opportunity to realize the tax incentives. Just as we seen over the last couple of years, there have been extensions in terms of timeframes and even extensions in terms of the available percentage of the tax credit in the given period. So maintaining flexibility and optionality is our first priority. We continue to feel very comfortable with the 2021 and 2022 build being able to meet the equipment needs and ultimately bring them into service and timeframes that are very attractive from an Energy Resources perspective.
JohnKetchum: Yes. I would think of the Safe Harbor extension as being certainly an incremental opportunity for us. One of the advantages that we have is we're always careful on how we manage our safe harbor vintaging. And we're fortunate because we were in good shape on our 2017 vintage portfolio. And so the Safe Harbor extension creates 1 to 1.5 gigawatts of opportunity for us on the wind side. And if I could come back just for one second on Stephen Byrd's question on the EBITDA multiples, the EBITDA multiples on this drop down were consistent with what we've done in the past. You got to remember, it always gets a little bit tricky with tax credits. You also have to remember that even after the sale the NEP we own again, NEE owns a good portion NEP we get the cash distributions, we get IDRS. When you take all that into account on EBITDA multiple basis, we end up with what we believe is a very competitive marker against where renewable assets trade today.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs.
MichaelLapides: Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. Actually I have a couple. First of all, just broad big picture renewables. Do you think you're taking share? Meaning, do you think your market share of renewable capacity in the US is actually growing from here? Are you mostly benefiting from the dramatic tailwinds that are happening to the overall space? That's question one. Question two is, there are lots of new entrants every day someone, a new entrant gets announced and well funded, whether it's by pension funds, whether it's European big oil, whether it's by some of the large, super well capitalized and well known alternative asset managers. We saw an announcement out of one of them yesterday of the day before about funding a solar and storage startup. What's that doing the returns? Are you seeing that kind of flow in the cash flow returns yet of new projects you're developing today versus what you may have done a year or 18 months ago?
RebeccaKujawa: So Mike, I'll start with the middle of it and maybe expand to the right and the left, the middle of it is this market is absolutely growing significantly, and we expect it to continue to grow significantly for years to come. So from our perspective, the pie absolutely is getting bigger. Over a long period of time, our market share has remained very strong in the 20-ish percent range for wind and probably in the mid-teens, occasionally a little bit higher and occasional, probably in the mid teens on solar and storage has actually been higher than both of those, as this market has grown significantly over the last couple of years. When we look out, we focus on both maintaining market share and also maintaining attractive returns. And we think our competitive advantages have enabled us to do that over time and we think both is important and best among them is very important to John and his team are focused on getting the best of the projects that we see out in the marketplace. And ultimately being very happy with the projects that we put into the portfolio.  We get asked the question about new entrants a lot. You know this industry well, if you look back and you stack power purchase agreement awards over many years, you'll see that very big bar to the left when we put the chart together, and a couple of bars that are in smaller, of course, but still decent size and then a whole bunch of small players. They get 100, a couple 100 megawatts a given year. And that dynamic continues to be consistent. That's for Greenfield and kind of in the more development oriented projects, there has been more capital coming in. But that's mostly post COD. And when we think about capturing the value of developing renewables, it really is on that twinkle in the eye of a developer to COD is the enormous opportunity to create value, and we continue to be very good at it, and enhances competitive advantages to maintain that position over time. So we're really excited about what we've been able to accomplish really excited about our position, and really excited about the energy transformation overall and the opportunities that presents.
MichaelLapides: Got it and then one quick follow up just on NEP, you still have the IDR structure at NEP, and as NEP grows, at what point do you think that becomes, and you've made a revision to it, but it's been a while, but at what point do you reevaluate the necessity of the IDR at the NEE level, and especially given the fact that kind of IDR structures have significantly gone away from some of the other industries that used to use them?
RebeccaKujawa: Michael, we, obviously we've gotten that question before and in the past, and of course, from NEE's perspective, we continue to be happy with the relationship as it exists today between NEE and NEP. And there's a lot of synergy between the two companies and value created from each of their perspectives from the structure that's in place. And that alignment of incentives remains important we believe to ensuring value creation from both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners perspective. We are excited about the opportunities for both businesses. And we'll see what the future brings but it continues to work and we're very pleased with the alignment of interest today.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, with that we will conclude today's question-and-answer session and conference call. We do thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-04-21 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and welcome to the NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners First Quarter 2021 Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jessica Aldridge, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead ma'am.
Jessica Aldridge: Thank you, Rocco. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter 2021 combined earnings conference call for NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. With me this morning are Jim Robo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; Rebecca Kujawa, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; John Ketchum, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources and Mark Hickson, Executive Vice President of NextEra Energy, all of whom are also officers of NextEra Energy Partners as well as Eric Silagy, President and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light Company. Rebecca will provide an overview of our results and our executive team will then be available to answer your questions. We will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call, in the Risk Factors section of the accompanying presentation or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found on our websites, nexteraenergy.com and nexteraenergypartners.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. Today's presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of historical non-GAAP measures to the closest GAAP financial measure. As a reminder Gulf Power legally merged into Florida Power & Light Company effective on January 1, 2021. Gulf Power will continue as a separate reporting segment within Florida Power & Light and NextEra Energy through 2021, serving its existing customers under separate retail rates. Throughout today's presentation when we refer to FPP, we're referring to Florida Power & Light excluding Gulf Power unless otherwise noted or when using the term combined. With that, I will turn the call over to Jim.
Rebecca Kujawa: Thank you, Jessica and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy is off to a terrific start in 2021 and has made excellent in the core focused areas that we discussed on the last call. Adjusted earnings per share increased nearly 14% year-over-year reflecting successful performance across all of the businesses. FPL increased net income by approximately $78 million from the prior year comparable period which was driven by continued investment in the business for the benefit of our customers. During the quarter FPL successfully placed in service approximately 300 megawatts of additional cost effective solar projects built under its SolarTogether program which remains the largest community solar program in the nation. FPL now owns and operates approximately 2,640 megawatts of solar on its combined system which is more than any other utility in the country. FPL's other major capital investments including the 409 megawatts Manatee Energy Storage Center and highly efficient 1,200 megawatt Dania Beach Clean Energy Center are also on schedule and on budget. By executing on smart capital investments such as these FPL is able to maintain its best-in-class customer value proposition of clean energy, low bills, highly reliability and outstanding customer service. FPL's typical residential bills remains well below the national average and the lowest in the nation among the 20 largest US investor-owned utilities while our service reliability has never been higher. Gulf Power also had a strong quarter of execution. The focus on the operational cost effectiveness at Gulf Power continues to progress well with a 43% increase in net income year-over-year primarily driven by year-to-date OEM cost declining by approximately 21% versus the prior year comparable period and by more than 34% relative to 2018. Gulf Power also delivered further improvements in service reliability and employee safety with no OSHA recordable year-to-date through the end of March. We remain committed to delivering on the objective that we've previously outlined at Gulf Power and continue to expect to generate significant customer and shareholder value over the coming years. At Energy Resources, adjusted earnings increased 13% year-over-year and it was another strong quarter of renewables origination with our backlog increasing by approximately 1,750 megawatts since the last call. We continue to see increased stakeholder focused on environmental social and governance or ESG factors helping to drive accelerated demand for diversified clean energy solutions among new non-traditional customers particularly in the commercial and industrial sector as an attractive source of incremental growth for Energy Resources in the coming years. We have been encouraged by the Biden Administrations focus on clean energy and the emphasis they have placed on it in their budget and in the upcoming infrastructure package. We continue to work with the administration on their important efforts around extensions of existing renewable credits, new credits for transmission and storage including hydrogen as well as a new clean energy standard for the electric sector. We support a clean energy standard that accelerates the decarbonization of the electric grid and enables the decarbonization of the transportation and industrial sectors as well. We believe that no energy company in the world has been more committed, consistent and proactive in promoting smart investments in clean energy technology as we have been for over two decades. As a push for actions to address climate change and acceleration of progress towards decarbonization creates new and enhanced renewable incentives across our industry. We continue to believe that no company is better positioned than NextEra Energy to continue to drive change and capitalize on these trends. At this early point in the year, we are very pleased with our progress at FPL, Gulf Power and Energy Resources. Now let's turn to the detailed results beginning first with FPL. For the first quarter of 2021, FPL reported net income of $720 million or $0.37 per share. Earnings per share increased $0.04 year-over-year. Regulatory capital employed growth of 10.8% was a significant driver of FPL's EPS growth versus the prior year comparable quarter. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $1.4 billion for the quarter and we expect our full year capital investments to be between $6.6 billion and $6.8 billion. FPL's reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.6% for the 12 months ending March 2021. During the quarter we utilized $316 million of reserved amortization to achieve our target regulatory ROE leaving FPL with a balance of $578 million. As we previously discussed, FPL historically utilizes more reserved amortization in the first half of the year given the pattern of its underlying revenues and expenses and we expect to continue this trend this year. Let me now turn to Gulf Power which reported first quarter 2021 net income of $57 million or $0.03 per share. Gulf Power's capital expenditures were $170 million for the quarter as it continues to execute on smart capital investments for the benefit of customers and we expect its full capital investments for the year to be between $800 million and $900 million. All of Gulf Power's major capital investments including the North Florida resiliency connection that is expected to be in service in mid-2022 continue to progress well. As a result of these ongoing investments regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 16% year-over-year. Gulf Power's reported ROE for regulatory purposes is expected to be approximately 10.4% for the 12 months ending March 2021. Turning to our development and planning efforts. We recently filed an updated 10-year site plan for FPL and Gulf Power which we expect will begin to operate as an integrated electric system in 2022. The 10-year site plan projects that zero emission sources will provide nearly 40% of all energy produced across the combined FPL system in 2030. Largely as a result of FPL's continued rapid expansion of solar energy through the execution of its 30-by-30 plan and success in its coal phase out strategy. FPL expects to add 3,800 megawatts of additional cost effective solar over the next four year and we now control all of the land needed to meet our projected solar deployment of 11.7 gigawatts by 2030 for the combined FPL system. The site plan also reflects and expect a total deployment of more than 1,200 megawatts of storage capacity by 2030. This plan is consistent with our belief that renewable generation and particularly solar paired with battery storage in Florida is an increasingly cost effective form of generation in most parts of the US. As we execute on these opportunities, we project that FPL's combined emissions rate will be 62% lower in 2030 than the industry average was in 2005 and 20% lower than the US Department of Energy's projected industry average in 2030. Moreover we continue to plan and invest in sustainable solutions to broaden how we serve customers and prepare for an even cleaner future. During the quarter FPL placed in service nearly 70 new electric vehicle charging ports and is now operating nearly 400 electric vehicle charging ports in the state as part of our goal to install more than 1,000 charging ports in more than 100 location across the combined FPL service area from 2019 through 2020. As we previously discussed, we're also developing hydrogen electrolysis project at FPL's Okeechobee combined cycle unit as part of our efforts to introduce further fuel diversity and resiliency into FPL's generation system. There approximately 25 megawatts solar connected electrolyzer that will be used to generate clean hydrogen as part of the Okeechobee pilot will be the largest of its kind in the US to-date. While these projects are just a few examples of our advanced deployment efforts at FPL. We are excited about the immense opportunities that lie ahead as our industry moves towards cleaner and more sustainable future. The Florida economy continues to recover from the early effects of the pandemic and is among the strongest in the nation. Their current unemployment rate of 4.7% is well below the national average. The real estate sector continues to grow with average building permits Case - Shiller index for South Florida up approximately 6% and 10% respectively versus the prior year. Florida's retail sales index continued its quarter-over-quarter improvement which is a further indication of the ongoing health in our economy and bolster our confidence in our smart investment strategy required to serve anticipated demand growth. During the quarter FPL's average number of customers increased by approximately 71,400 or 1.4% versus the comparable prior year quarter driven by continued solid underlying population growth. FPL's first quarter retail sales decreased 1.7% from the prior year comparable period which is primarily due to mild weather in the first quarter of this year versus 2020. We estimate that approximately 3% of the decline can be attributed to weather related usage for customer. On a weather normalized basis, first quarter retail sales increased 1.3% with continued strong underlying usage contributing favorably. For Gulf Power the average number of customers grew 1.1% versus the comparable prior year quarter driven by continued economic growth in Northwest Florida. Gulf Power's first quarter retail sales increased to 2.9% year-over-year primarily due to favorable weather. On March 12, we submitted testimony and detailed supporting information for Florida Power & Light 2021 base rate proceeding. The overall proposal for our 2022 through 2025 base rate plan is substantially consistent with a test year. We are requesting a base rate adjustment of approximately $1.1 billion starting in January 2022, $607 million starting in January 2023 and solar base rate adjustments or SoBRA mechanisms in 2024 and 2025 for up to 1,788 megawatts of cost effective solar. We are proud to offer our customers service that ranks among the cleanest and the most reliable in the country with typical residential bills of approximately 13% low state average and importantly nearly 10% lower than in 2006. The four-year base plan has been designed to support continued investments in the long-term infrastructure and advance technology which continues to improve our already best in class reliability and helps keep customer bills low. With the proposed base rate adjustments and current projections for fuel and other cost. We believe that FPL's typical residential bills will grow in an average annual rate of about 3.4% from January 2021 through the end of 2025 which is expected to result in FPL's typical residential bill being approximately 20% below the projected national average and more than 20% lower than our typical bills, 15 years ago when adjusted for inflation. Typical Gulf Power residential bills are projected to decreased approximately 1% over the four-year rate plan. The Florida Public Service Commission has established a schedule for the proceeding beginning with Quality of Service hearing in June and technical hearings in late August. The proceedings would conclude in the fourth quarter with a staff of recommendations and commission rulings on revenue requirements and rates. We look forward to the opportunity to present our case to the commission this summer and our focus will be to pursue a balanced outcome that supports continued execution of our successful strategy for customers. As always, we're open to the possibility of resolving our rate request through a fair settlement agreement. Energy Resources reported first quarter 2021 GAAP earnings of $491 million or $0.25 per share. Adjusted earnings for the first quarter were $598 million or $0.30 per share up 13% versus the prior year comparable period. New investments added $0.04 per share primarily reflecting growth in the renewables and storage business including more than 2,700 megawatts of new contracted win projects that were commissioned during 2020. The extreme market conditions in Texas in February were the primary driver of the underperformance in our existing generation portfolio and customer supply and trading business as well as the favourable performance in the gas infrastructure business. As a reminder when weather events like this occur, we operate our businesses in Texas as a portfolio and while there were pluses and minuses during these events. We believe the end result is a testament to the strength of our large and well diversified business. All weather impacts increased results by $0.03 versus 2020. As I mentioned earlier, Energy Resources development team had another strong quarter of origination. We added 503 megawatts of new solar projects to our backlog including a 190 megawatts of solar that will be paired with approximately 100 megawatts of four-hour battery storage capacity. In 2020, our market share of signed contracts and collocated solar plus storage assets in US was more than 35% and we're excited about the continued trend and demand for collocated storage solutions as we anticipate even further cost synergies by pairing low-cost renewables with storage solutions in the coming decades as being an important part of decarbonization in our sector. We also added 916 megawatts of new win projects to our backlog for 2022. In addition, our backlog increased by energy resources share of NextEra Energy Partners planned acquisition of 391 megawatts of operating wind projects announced earlier this week. With the approximately 1,750 megawatts added this quarter our backlog of signed contracts at Energy Resources now totals approximately 15,250 megawatts supporting our industry leading long-term growth expectations. We remain enthusiastic about the expanded investment opportunities that the broad decarbonization of the US economy presents for Energy Resources and we continue to evaluate pilot projects for industrial, transportation and electric sector applications. In addition to the pilots and partnerships we've discussed on prior calls. We've recently committed to make a minority investment in a clean energy technology company that has developed a proprietary process to essentially decarbonize the industrial production of hydrogen at economic prices. This investment and the hydrogen pilots we've announced to-date show the promise of electrification across our economy and we're excited for the opportunity to participate in these new markets and build renewables to support future growth and demand for electricity. Consistent with our long-term track record we will remain disciplined as we take steps to be at the forefront of this developing market while taking a leadership role in the clean energy transition. Beyond renewables and storage, NextEra Energy Transmission further its efforts to build America's leading transmission company with a closing of its acquisition of GridLiance occurring at the end of last month. GridLiance which owns three FERC regulated transmission utilities spanning six states is an excellent complement to our existing operations and further expand NextEra Energy's regulated business through the addition of attractive rate regulated assets. NextEra Energy Transmission now owns regulated assets in 10 states and six regional transmission organizations. Growth in renewables means that there is also a growing imperative to build additional transmission across the US to support this transmission to a low cost, low carbon economy fueled by renewable energy. Our incorporation of GridLiance into our portfolio furthers our strategy to be North America's leading competitive transmission provider both to deploy capital profitably as well as to enable further renewables deployment. Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the first quarter of 2021 GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $1.67 billion or $0.84 per share. NextEra Energy's 2021 first quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $1.33 billion and $0.67 per share respectively. Adjusted earnings from corporate and other segments were roughly flat year-over-year. Long-term financial expectations which we increased and extended to late last year through 2023 remained unchanged. For 2021, NextEra Energy expects adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.40 to $2.54. For 2022 and 2023, NextEra Energy expects to grow 6% to 8% off of the expected 2021 adjusted earnings per share and we will be disappointed if we're not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of these ranges in 2021, 2022 and 2023 while at the same time maintaining our strong credit ratings. From 2018 to 2023 we continue to expect that operating cash flow will grow roughly in line with our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. We also continue to expect to grow dividends per share roughly 10% rate per year through at least 2022 off of 2020 base. As always, our expectations assume normal weather and operating conditions. Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners which delivered very strong first quarter results with year-over-year growth and adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution of approximately 20% and 36% respectively. Yesterday the NextEra Energy Partners board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.6375 per common unit or $2.55 per common unit on an annualized basis up approximately 15% from a year earlier inclusive of this increased NextEra Energy Partners has grown its distribution per unit by 240% since the IPO. Further building on that strength, NextEra Energy Partners recently announced that it had entered into an agreement to acquire an approximately 400 megawatt portfolio of long-term contracted wind assets. This transaction will be NextEra Energy Partners first third-party acquisition of renewable energy assets and represents another step towards growing LP unit distributions in a manner consistent with our previously stated expectations of 12% to 15% per year through at least 2024. I'll provide additional detail on the transaction in just a few minutes. Turning to the detailed quarterly results. NextEra Energy Partners first quarter adjusted EBITDA was $354 million and cash available for distribution was $184 million. New projects which primarily reflect the assets acquisitions that closed at the end of 2020 contributed $27 million of adjusted EBITDA and $13 million of cash available for distribution. Existing projects added $39 million of adjusted EBITDA and $23 million of cash available for distribution. This strong year-over-year increase in adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution includes favorable results from NextEra Energy Partners wind and natural gas pipeline investments in Texas during the February winter storm partially offset by the impacts of an accelerated outage at our Genesis project during the quarter. Cash available for distribution also benefited from a reduction in corporate level interest payments primarily as a result of certain refinancing activities completed in the fourth quarter of last year. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide. As I previously mentioned, we continue to execute on our plan to expand NextEra Energy Partners portfolio and recently entered into an agreement to acquire an approximately 400 megawatt portfolio of long-term contracted operating wind projects. The portfolio has a cash available distribution weighted average contract life of approximately 13 years with high credit quality customers and further enhances the diversity of NextEra Energy Partners existing portfolio. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of this year subject to customary closing conditions and the receipt of certain regulatory approvals and generate an attractive CAFY yield and be immediately accretive to LP distributions. This transaction demonstrates the NextEra Energy Partners continued ability to execute on its long-term growth plan and it's enhanced by our ability to take advantage of Energy Resources best in class operating platform to reduce operating expenses at the assets. Energy Resources continues to leverage our culture of continuous improvement to realize lower cost across its renewable assets that it operates. Since 2017 Energy Resources have reduced fleet-wide dollar per megawatt hour O&M cost in its wind fleet by more than 30% and we believe those Energy Resources wind and solar operating expenses are significantly better than its industry peers. With Energy Resources operate in the NextEra Energy Partners renewable assets these cost advantages directly benefit LP unit holders. Over the coming years, we look forward to leveraging the benefits of energy resources operating portfolio platform for both NextEra Energy Partners existing portfolio as well as to add incremental value to future third-party acquisitions. In addition to providing attractive base returns, these projects are well situated in attractive markets that we anticipate will have significant long-term renewables demand, supporting asset recontracting or potential repowering opportunities after the initial contract terms. We continue to believe that the existing NextEra Energy Partners portfolio has meaningful organic growth opportunities over the coming years and expect the portfolio we're acquiring provides additional long-term investments opportunities as well. NextEra Energy Partners expects to acquire the portfolio for a base purchase price of approximately $733 million subject to closing adjustments. The portfolio of assets is expected to contribute adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution of approximately $63 million to $70 million each on a five-year average annual run rate basis beginning in December 31, 2021. We believe this transaction is an attractive investment in which to deploy the $345 million of undrawn funds from the 2020 convertible equity portfolio financing which we use to fund the acquisition along with the existing NextEra Energy Partners debt capacity. Following the recently announced transaction we now expect to be in the upper end of our previously disclosed year end 2021 run rate adjusted EBITDA and cast the expectation ranges of $1.44 billion to $1.62 billion and $680 million respectively. As a reminder, all of our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and includes the impact of anticipated IDR fees as we treat these as an operating expense. From the base of our fourth quarter 2020 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $2.46, we continue to see 12% to 15% growth per year in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2024. We expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2021 distribution that is payable in February 2022 to be in the range of $2.76 to $2.83 per common unit. In summary, after a strong start to the year, we remain as enthusiastic as ever about the long-term growth prospects for both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. At FPL, we continue to focus on delivering our best-in-class customer value proposition through operational cost effectiveness, productivity and making smart long-term investments. Energy Resources main significant competitive advantages and continues to capitalize on the best renewables development period in our history. Combined with the strength of our balance sheet and credit ratings, NextEra Energy is uniquely positioned to drive long-term shareholder value and we remain intensely focused on executing on these opportunities. NextEra Energy Partners is well positioned to deliver on its already best in class run rate for LP distribution growth. Finally, last month we were honored the NextEra was ranked Number 1 in its sector for Fortune magazine's World's Most Admired Company's list for the 14th time in 15 years. Moreover, we're recognized for the 14th time as one of the world's most ethical companies by Ethisphere Institute which is a testament to our team of nearly 15,000 employees who are committed to our core values while helping to build a sustainable energy era that is affordable and clean. In the coming weeks, we expect to publish NextEra Energy's 2021 ESG Report which we believe establishes our full alignment with the taskforce for climate related financial disclosures or TCFD recommendations. We're also excited to announce our commitment to participation in the Carbon Disclosure Project survey later this year. These enhanced disclosures highlight the alignment of our corporate strategy with a key tenant of ESG which our company has been focused on for more than 25 years and remains key to execution of our strategy moving forward. That concludes our prepared remarks and with that, I will open up the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] today's first question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.
Shar Pourreza: Just couple of questions here. First just on transmission opportunities, obviously you closed GridLiance this quarter and there's been some proposals across the US including California for transmission expansions. Can we maybe get a little bit of refreshed view on your transmission growth strategy and kind of geographies where you may seek to expand? Do you guys see more opportunities for acquisitions perhaps from other PT [ph] type owners? And just as a follow-up here, any thoughts on sort of the new FERC administration recent language could hinder I think future transmission investment with potentially lower ROE removals some of the ROE adders, so just some thoughts there.
Rebecca Kujawa: Perfect, thanks Shar. I was going to say yes, the question. But I think its multiple questions in here. So I'll start and obviously John or Jim can jump in, if they want to add something. We are very excited about opportunities in transmission and it is founded on a couple of points that I highlighted in the script. First, is we couldn't be more excited as you well know about the renewables opportunities across the US in the coming decades. A key part of all of those opportunities or at least a lot of those opportunities in later part of this decade going into the 2030s and beyond, is some level of build out of transmission in the US beyond what's been accomplished. So both to enable to long-term renewables development but also to capitalize on those opportunities leaves us very interested in transmission. The Energy Resources team has done a terrific job growing that business both through organic opportunities so long-term development efforts identifying opportunities, participating in processes and ultimately securing opportunities to invest and build and build successfully into line and into operation some of those lines as well as through acquisitions. Obviously with GridLiance being the most recent and Trans Bay Cable not being too much far behind it. I expect that we'll grow the business through both going forward as well continued efforts on the development side as well as participating in opportunities to acquire investments as they come to market. On the FERC transmission side, we do think there are lot of opportunities to improve how transmission is sided and built across the US and we're optimistic that this administration and this FERC will start to focus on those and I think to go through FERC as well as potential focus on transmission in this infrastructure package. So a lot of opportunities to invest in the future.
John Ketchum: Yes, the only thing that I would add to what Rebecca said there is, we love GridLiance. Think of our transmission presence of doughnut. We had a hole in the middle. This gets us in the SPP and MISO. We're now a member as a TO - important for [indiscernible] as well. It's strategic. It's going to help enable lot of new renewable development for us. So it lines up really well with where we see renewable growth opportunities going forward. And even with the news coming out of FERC on the ROE, we'll see what they'll ultimately do. Don't forget that we've been able to enter in the long-term settlements at Trans Bay and on Lone Star as well and so our business is really unimpacted.
Shar Pourreza: Got it perfect, thank you. And then just on the rate case and obviously it's starting to pick up steam, intervene is turning together. Are you seeing any early indications for what sort of topics that maybe debated? I mean affordability is the obvious one, cross - subsidization between the two merged utilities that could be another ROE. So just maybe just thinking about the bit ask there. At this juncture, do you sort of feel there is a settlement path or does this case kind of need to be more litigated just given the complexities of merging two utilities.
Rebecca Kujawa: Thanks Shar. I think it's really early to comment on the rate case. We just filed. I think you've heard us comment a couple of times, these as U-Haul trucks versus filing requirements that we produce and supply to staff and the interveners and the commission itself to start the process. So we're very early and no doubt all of the key stakeholders just trying to review that information and then we'll see the process unfold really over quite a number of months accommodating with the hearings in August. We are very proud as I highlight in the comments both here and in other venues. We're really proud of the case that the FPL team has put together not just the case itself. But it's built on a foundation of execution not just over the last five years during which we've operated under the settlement agreements but of course years and years before that. So we look forward to the opportunity to articulating that through this process. As it relates to settlements, as you know here in Florida there is a great history of settlement agreements not just with Florida Power & Light Company but other utilities in the state. We do think that opportunities to have a negotiated outcomes that meets the need of all stakeholders and historically that is produced consistent rates for many years in the future that provides tremendous value for customers. There's a great history of that. We of course will be open to it. But it's very early in this process and again we look forward to being able to put forward our case.
Shar Pourreza: And just lastly on Santee Cooper, I mean obviously the discussion they're picking up steam at the legislator. And do you think we should we kind of watching for in the near term on the legislature side and your bids out there? So do you see any kind of changes with your offer or you're just kind of standing firm at this point?
Jim Robo: Sure, it's Jim. Obviously, you saw the senate asked for folks to re-express an interest. I sent a letter last week re-expressing our interest. We've been pretty clear that we remain interested. We have a very strong bid out there. Obviously, things are changed in the last year with Santee Cooper rate base is different. Their volumes are different etc, etc. But fundamentally our bid stands and we're ready to get going and negotiating with the state on the sale and ultimately the most important thing is, it remains very clear to me that the best route to the state and its customer and the economy of the state is to demunicipalize [ph] Santee Cooper and get it in the hands of an entity like ourselves that will run it in best in class way and there's enormous value I think to bring to the state through our ability to bring to decarbonize, our ability to have low bills over the long period of time and our ability to really operate efficiently and bring great reliability to bear. I think you've seen the progress we've made at Gulf and I think that's a great example of the kind of progress that we'd be able to make at Santee Cooper as well.
Shar Pourreza: Terrific, thank you guys for everything and good execution.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Steve Fleishman: Just curios first on the NEP acquisition, as you mentioned for the most part historically you haven't been able to make the turns lower fund third-party acquisitions. So could you maybe talk about the returns you expect on this transaction and is this a suggestion that you're more optimistic that there'll be more third-party acquisitions that meet your return hurdles.
Rebecca Kujawa: We're really excited about the acquisition and we've highlighted both in terms of the financial characteristics of it. One of the things that was particularly attractive about this portfolio when we looked at it is, our teams' ability to add value on the operation and maintenance cost side. Really think about as we bring assets into the portfolio, it really gets leveraged on the platform that we already operate and so the team is really excited about how we can add incremental value through the Energy Resources management of these assets at NextEra Energy Partners. We've been very excited about NextEra Energy Partners growth outlook for quite some time as we've always indicated our excitement is well founded, just simply looking at the backlog of those operating and signed contracts and then the potential for new contract synergy resources. But have always alluded to the fact that really our market opportunity is this broader market set and we'll continue to engage and look for opportunities. I do think there are more opportunities out there, third-party acquisitions on the renewables side. It's an area of focus for us to continue to participate in. but we've got the three ways to grow and to the extent that we can put opportunities to be rather great and we'll take advantage of them overtime. But we also continue to have terrific organic opportunities in NEP particularly as the portfolio grows and then of course the continued success of Energy Resources in the broader market is very positive.
Steve Fleishman: Okay and just any sense on the returns you expect on this acquisition?
Rebecca Kujawa: Sure. We've already highlighted in terms of cap fee produced for the assets $60 million plus relative to the acquisition price that we highlighted obviously that's subject to closing adjustments. So that's at the project level and then we'll optimize the financing overtime particularly as we think about the rest of the growth expectations for 2021 into 2022.
Steve Fleishman: Okay and then just maybe a little bit more color on the Biden infrastructure and tax plan just I guess maybe obviously you made it clear that the infrastructure side will be beneficial for your business. How are you thinking on the tax side and are there any risk to you from that either just the high rate or the minimum book tax issue? Thanks.
Jim Robo: Steve, its Jim. Obviously, there was a lot unpacked in the plan. It's very early in the process. I think this is a process that's going to play out over months, not weeks. There's obviously a lot in the plan that's very positive from a renewable standpoint and as Rebecca said in the prepared remarks, we're excited to work with the administration on the plan that I think is really going to accelerate the decarbonization of the US economy over the next several years in a way that we've always said for a long time is going to be essentially free to customers i.e. not more expensive for customers. I mean the thing about the green economy is that it's cleaner, it's greener but it's also cheaper and that's why it's so powerful. So lot of details obviously still to be worked out. We're working them as you can imagine it's very early and probably too early for me to comment on any of the specific details that we feel like need some work versus the ones that we like a lot. On the tax front, I think obviously that's - there are a lot of puts and takes with taxes particularly in a company that has both utility assets as well as renewables assets and we're working through it. Think about the tax rate going up something in the $0.04 to $0.07 of headwinds. I'm not particularly worried about that in the context of all the other things that would be positive for our company if the infrastructure bill gets passed. So we continue to work obviously that as well. Lots of details still be laid out on the minimum tax issue and that also matters as to what the final corporate rate ends up being. And I guess the last thing I would say is, none of this is going to be easy to get done. It's very narrow margins in both the Senate in the House and folks tend to focus on the Senate. Its extraordinarily narrow margin given kind of vacancies in the house right now as well and there's - the history on mid-term elections suggests that it's always an uphill battle for the current administration in mid-term for whatever party is in power in mid-term elections on a presidency. So that on the one hand I think put some urgency I think around the administrations push to get something this year. But the flipside is, it also - there's a lot of risk for moderate democrats to take a vote on some of these issues. It's going to be very - any change will be very hard. I think we were very much a part of the - we've always been very active in terms of what happens around clean energy policy in Washington and you can imagine that we're remaining very active on that front and working it very hard. But I will just say in closing, that we're very much encouraged by the focus of the administration on decarbonising the economy. We feel like it's the - absolutely the right thing for the planet and the right thing for customers and the right thing for the country and we stand ready to support an infrastructure plan that accelerates that decarbonization and I think, any acceleration of what's already going on just because of the amazing economics that renewables have relative to the other alternatives plus what's going on with hydrogen and you saw there was a PTC, hydrogen PTC as part of the suggested as part of the infrastructure plan. So there's a lot of very positive things in there that we're going to be working on to build on over the next several months.
Steve Fleishman: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question today comes from Stephen Byrd at Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Stephen Byrd: Wanted to explore green hydrogen a little bit further. You all have expressed a lot of enthusiasm about the potential for growth here and the potential for joint venture activity and I was just curious, your latest thinking there and I guess broadly I've been thinking that sort of combing best in class renewables that you have with significant capabilities and actually sort of marketing, distributing, selling etc hydrogen would be critical to success in terms of supply of unused customers with green hydrogen. I'm just curious your general outlook enthusiasm for the prospect for more JV announcements.
Rebecca Kujawa: Perfect. Thanks Stephen. Let me start with the longer-term view first and then come back to the shorter term which would really tie into I think the latter part of your question in comment. The first part which is the latter term view is when we look at substantial deployment of renewable and battery storage and think about how do you further decarbonize the US electricity sector. When we previously ran that analysis just trying to add more renewables and add more battery storage. It became very burdensome for customers because you aren't getting a significant amount of value to the more and more renewables and storage you add, absent other actions. So when we incorporated hydrogen into that thought which is effectively a form of long duration storage that is taking advantage of chief electricity production coming from renewables in some cases excess renewable production at certain times of the day. That substantially changes the value equation for customers to fully decarbonize in the electricity sector. So that gives us great excitement about the potential for substantial renewables and battery storage deployment knowing that as you continue to deploy more and you find economic forms of long duration storage that continues to be very value accretive to customers both in cost and in the performance of clean energy. So that's kind of the starting point, but then coming back to a little bit more nearer term. If you think about how do you decarbonize transportation industrial sectors. The most exciting ways to do that, that we see today is through electrification whether that's in the form of electric vehicles fueled by batteries or other type of fuel cells or through hydrogen and hydrogen probably more applicable on the industrial sector particularly for applications that already exist today. And as Jim highlighted the potential for hydrogen production tax credit being considered by the administration and by Congress is part of the infrastructure package. In the near term we could see a closing of the GAAP perhaps fairly quickly to creating this as an economic alternative to other fuel sources today that are fossil fuel based. So yes, we couldn't be more excited about it for both the opportunities for renewables for electricity sector, industrial and transportation. But also as you suggested potentially to participate in the hydrogen infrastructure itself whether it's the electrolyzer or rather forms of creating and distributing the molecules. How much and where we participate in that is really one of the things that we're focused on in all of these different pilots. That both John and the Energy Resources team as well as Eric within Florida Power & Light are thinking through today. How do we do that economically? How do we leverage some of the scale benefits and opportunities that our business can bring to bear in these opportunities? You'll see us continue to place small bets to get experienced to build relationships to gain knowledge and in the short-term that won't add up to heck of a lot of capital investment opportunity. But it will add up to a tremendous amount of learning and continuing to focus our strategies on where we can add significant amount of value to the infrastructure and the market and ultimately to our shareholders as well.
Stephen Byrd: That's really helpful and then just separately thinking about the mix of growth that resources. Obviously, there's a lot of solar activity, lot of solar megawatts that you'll be deploying. I just wanted to get your latest thinking on the outlook for returns between solar and wind. I guess I generally hear continued views that yes, solar returns certainly lower than wind. There is more competition there. But just curious your latest thoughts on solar versus wind return outlook.
Rebecca Kujawa: From a return standpoint, we do see a differential we have quite for time overall returns between wind and solar from a risk adjusted basis. We're happy with returns that we've seen in both sets of technologies. In the short-term in terms of backlog John and the Energy Resources team certainly influenced by what I think is the conventional wisdom for a long time, the step downs for the production tax credit on wind and the step down for the investment tax credit on solar or in fact likely to happen. I think our customers now are thinking about that a little differently as discussions in Washington have started to heat up. But as we look what our likely outcomes as Jim was talking through including the potential for extensions of those incentives. I think the key takeaway is, they remain both technologies are very likely to remain economic for our customers to deploy on behalf of their customers and ultimately leading to significant cost savings for electricity buyers at the end of the day. So they remain attractive from our perspective and we continue to focus our development and efforts on wherever we can add value for our customers.
Stephen Byrd: Very good. Thank you very much.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Michael Weinstein: On the subject of third - party acquisition for NEP. Could you comment on any opportunities you're seeing in Texas following Winter Storm Uri? I think we've heard some previous comments there are lots of parties looking at distressed assists in the state and wondering that if there might be an opportunity for NEP as well.
Rebecca Kujawa: Yes Michael, I think it's probably still a little bit too soon. I think most participants in the market are still working through a lot of the implications and learning's from Texas. So I'm not sure there's a lot to be commented on in the near term. It's obviously something we'll stay engaged in the market and participate where it makes sense. But at this point, I think it's too soon.
Michael Weinstein: Can you comment a little bit about how much it costs to weatherize in the state? What actions you guys have been taking since the storm?
Rebecca Kujawa: So we've done a lot of deep dives across our portfolio to think about where weatherizing makes sense. As I've talked about in the past and you all know, we have a lot of interest across Texas not only wind investment, solar, battery storage, gas infrastructure investments and of course the small retail business. So we've been carefully thinking through all of - whether the opportunities to learn and perhaps invest going forward. Specifically to weatherizing, I don't know if you were talking exclusively around the renewable fleet or you're talking about the gas infrastructure side. But on the renewable side keep in mind that weatherization really focuses on ambient temperature effects and ambient temperature at least for our fleet. I can't speak for everybody was not the real issue for any sort of production shortfall versus a P-50 forecast. It was really related to the fact in this extraordinary event that happened for multiple days it was preceded by an icing event. So ice was accumulating on our blades and when ice accumulates on the blades it's difficult for them to spin and because the temperatures remained low for several days in a row, there wasn't an opportunity for that ice to shed. Typically weatherization packages don't really address ice accumulation on the blades. This is something the industry is focused on. There are some - what at this point are very expensive solutions to try to address ice accumulation on the blades and given that they don't happen every year and certainly don't happen frequently across specific sites every year and ends up being very cost prohibitive for something that happened very sporadically. So I'm not optimistic that there's a substantial amount due to at least today with respect to weatherization on the wind side to change the events. I do think there's opportunities across the gas supply side to improve the ability for gas to flow which obviously was really at the crux of the issues along with not only natural gas, supply shortages but plant issues in the coal fleet and issues in nuclear fleet. So there's opportunities across the market to invest.
John Ketchum: And if I could just add to that, what Rebecca said, this is John. When you look at ERCOT's operating fleet what they really do have to address at the end of the way as weatherization of gas because you think about 87, 88 gigawatts that were supposed to be available. I mean renewables on an MCF adjusted basis for only about 3 gigawatts of that and very much a rounding error and the problem that occurred in Texas and so Texas really needs to think through what are the right solutions for gas because when you have icing conditions. It doesn't matter if it's blades on a turbine. It's combustion gas turbine. It's a nuclear power plant. It's a coal plant. When you have severe icing conditions. They're all going to fail and that's what we saw in Texas. And so the question is, what is going to be the right market construct going forward to provide the appropriate for weatherization and for backup fuel on site to make sure that these facilities are capable of running and I think those are the kinds of issues that the Texas legislature is currently evaluating.
Michael Weinstein: Got you. One last question from me. Does third - party acquisitions at NEP put any kind of pressure on IDR payments [ph] and the IDR scheme going forward?
Rebecca Kujawa: I'm not sure what you mean by pressure, they're ultimately the calculation for IDRs is one that's known and relates to the overall growth and cash flow within NEP. So it's not specific to where the acquisition source was for the asset.
Michael Weinstein: Okay, just wondering if you see a big uptick in third - party acquisition instead of dropdown cash going up to next year? Is there any kind of pressure one way or another to change the IDR structure?
Rebecca Kujawa: No there's not a difference in terms of the structure and at this point in time NextEra Energy Partners and NextEra Energy with the idea of the structure that's currently in place.
Michael Weinstein: Great, thank you.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's question-and-answer session and today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-01-26 09:00:00) =====

With that, I will turn the call over to Jim.
Jim Robo: Thanks, Jessica and good morning, everyone.  2020 was a terrific year for both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. NextEra Energy’s performance was strong both financially and operationally. We had outstanding execution on our initiatives to continue to drive future growth across the company. Across all of our businesses we successfully executed on the largest capital program in our history, deploying more than $14 billion in 2020 as we lead America’s clean energy transformation.  By successfully executing on our plans, NextEra Energy extended its long track record of delivering value for shareholders with adjusted earnings per share of $2.31, up 10.5% from 2019. A key element of our value proposition in NextEra Energy is a culture focused on delivering outstanding results for our shareholders.  Over the past ten years, we’ve delivered compound annual growth and adjusted EPS of 8%, which is the highest among all top ten power companies who have achieved on average compound annual growth of less than 3% over the same period.  Amid this significant growth, the company has maintained one of the strongest balance sheets and credit positions in the industry. In 2020, we delivered a total shareholder return of approximately 30%, significantly outperforming both the S&P 500 and the S&P 500 Utilities Index and continuing to outperform both indices in terms of total shareholder return on a one year, three year, five year, seven year and ten year basis.  Over the past 15 years, we’ve outperformed all of the other companies in the S&P 500 Utilities Index and 86% of the companies in the S&P 500, while more than tripling the average total shareholder return of both indices.  While we are proud of our long-term track record of creating shareholder value, we remain laser-focused on the future and on delivering our commitments.  NextEra Energy remains well positioned to capitalize on the disruptive forces reshaping our industry, which have expanded and accelerated over the past two years even beyond what we had anticipated. A combination of low cost renewable with low cost storage in the form of batteries today and hydrogen in the longer term has substantially increased the total addressable market for NextEra Energy.  We now believe that a substantial and economic decarbonization of the electricity, transportation and industrial sectors is possible, which represents the potential investment opportunity of trillions of dollars in the coming decades.  In the Electricity sector, we expect that older and more inefficient generation will continue to be retired and replaced with cleaner and more affordable alternatives.  In the Transportation sector, we believe it will be increasingly economic to replace fossil fuel vehicles with vehicles powered by fuel cells and batteries charged with renewable energy.  And in the Industrial sector, grey hydrogen and other high carbon feedstocks can be replaced with green hydrogen. We believe these trends have already been put into motion driven by economics. In addition, we believe it is possible that the Biden administration, supported by a significant shift in public support towards taking action to address climate change may act to further accelerate these shifts through the extension of existing incentives, as well as initiating other forms of policy support.  Importantly, we believe that no company is better equipped to take advantage of these substantial and long-term trends than NextEra Energy. In fact, NextEra Energy is already proof that you can be clean, low cost, and financially successful, all at the same time. We are at the vanguard of building a sustainable energy era that is both clean and affordable and we are driving hard to continue to be at the forefront of the disruption that is occurring within the energy sector in broader parts of the U.S. economy.  We expect that the execution of our strategy will drive meaningful CO2 emissions reductions across the country and will help advance NextEra Energy towards its goal of reducing its CO2 emissions rate by 67% by 2025 from a 2005 baseline, while simultaneously lowering generation cost for customers and maintaining best-in-class reliability.  We expect the disruptive nature of renewable to be terrific for customers, terrific for the environment and terrific for shareholders by helping to drive tremendous growth for this company over the next decade and beyond.  FPL is already capitalizing on the disruption in our sector with continued focus on its grid and fleet modernization efforts. During 2020, FPL successfully executed on its strategic initiatives including placing more than 1100 megawatts of cost-effective solar in service on time and on budget in support of its ongoing capital plan.  This solar expansion is part of FPL’s Solar Together community solar program and its groundbreaking 30 by 30 plan, which is one of the world’s largest solar expansions and would result in roughly 10,000 megawatts of total solar capacity on FPL’s system by 2030.  Additionally, the 409-megawatt Manatee Energy Storage Center, which will be the world’s largest integrated solar powered battery system is on track and on budget to be placed in service later this year as part of the approximately $1 billion that NextEra Energy is investing in battery storage projects in 2021.  Smart capital investments such as these help FPL improve its already best-in-class customer value proposition, while also maintaining an emissions profile that is among the cleanest in the nation. FPL also had continued success with its cost saving initiatives making even further reductions to its already best-in-class dollar per retail megawatt hour non-fuel O&M costs from 2019 to 2020.  Through our unrelenting focus on cost savings and on making disciplined long-term investments for the benefit of our customers, FPL has been able to maintain typical customer bills that are the lowest in the nation when compared to the 20 largest investor-owned utilities in the country. In addition to old builds, FPL has continued to provide reliability that is by far the best in the State of Florida, achieving its best ever reliability rate in 2020.  FPL’s investments to build a stronger, smarter energy grid have resulted in best-in-state reliability for the last 14 years in a row, as well as earning numerous national awards. In 2020, FPL was recognized for the fifth time in six years as being the most reliable electric utility in the nation.  Let me now turn to Gulf Power. In the two years that it has been part of the NextEra Energy family, Gulf Power has realized an approximately 30% reduction in O&M costs, a 50% improvement in service reliability, a 93% improvement in safety, and a nearly 20% reduction in CO2 emissions.  Gulf Power has grown regulatory capital employed at a 17% compound annual growth rate since 2018 and we are well on our way to achieving the objectives we laid out at our investor conference in 2019. In addition to the excellent operational execution that we delivered in 2020, we continue to progress our smart capital investment program that is expected to generate further customer benefits over the coming years.  In the fourth quarter, we completed the Plant Crist coal to natural gas conversion. As a result, consistent with our commitment to remain a clean energy leader, we were able to complete the accelerated shutdown of the coal units at Plant Crist, which is now been renamed the Gulf Clean Energy Center. With the retirement of FPL’s Indiantown Cogeneration facility also occurring late last year, 2021 is the first time in nearly 70 years that there are no coal-fired power plants in Florida for either FPL or Gulf Power.  Earlier this month, FPL filed the test year letter with the Florida Public Service Commission to initiate a rate proceeding for new rates beginning in January 2022. The four year plan that we intend to propose is designed to provide continued longer term cost certainty for customers, while allowing FPL to continue investing in clean energy, storm-hardened infrastructure and other innovative technologies that are the foundation of our communities.  The stability of multi-year rate plans allows FPL to focus on efficiency in the business which is critical to keeping customer bills low, while at the same time enabling FPL to maintain strong credit ratings and balance sheet which allows for consistent access to the capital markets.  We look forward to the opportunity to showcase our long-term track record of providing low bills, high reliability, and clean energy for Floridians and our plan is to build an even more resilient and sustainable energy future for Florida in the coming years.  Turning to Energy Resources, in 2020, we continued to advance our position as the leading developer and operator of wind, solar and battery storage projects commissioning approximately 5750-megawatts of new projects more than doubling the amount of total renewable commissioned versus the previous year. This was also a record year for renewable origination in Energy Resources with the team adding a net nearly 7000 megawatts to our backlog during the year.  As a result of the team’s origination success and alongside the backdrop of the terrific market outlook I just outlined at the beginning of my remarks, we now expect to construct approximately 23 to 30 Gigawatts of new renewable in the 2021 to 2024 timeframe, which if we are successful at the midpoint would mean adding a portfolio of generation projects that is approximately 1.5 times the size of Energy Resources’ entire operating renewable portfolio as of year-end 2019.  Energy Resources execution success is reflective of our ability to leverage our significant committed advantages, including our best-in-class development skills, large pipeline of sites in interconnection queue positions, strong customer relationships, purchasing power, best-in-class construction expertise, resource assessment capabilities, cost of capital advantages, and world-class operations capability to capitalize on the ongoing energy transition that is occurring in the nation’s generation fleet.  We believe that we are in a terrific position to be able to capture a significant share of the market opportunities going forward and what we continue to believe is the best renewable development environment we have ever seen.  Along with the broader public shift towards calls for action to fight climate change, over the past few years, there has been an increased focus on environmental, social and governance or ESG on the part of many of our stakeholders. While we expect this trend to amplify demand among our traditional customers and in our core renewables business, we also believe that it is opening up significant new markets and business opportunities for Energy Resources.  We anticipate our development program to be further enhanced by an ability to attract new non-traditional customers, particularly in the commercial and industrial sector as improving renewable economics are increasingly aligned with corporate objectives to procure energy from clean generation sources.  In summary, I continue to remain as enthusiastic as ever about NextEra Energy’s long-term growth prospects. In 2020, we extended our long track record of executing for the benefit of customers and shareholders and further developed our best-in-class organic growth prospects.  Based on the strength and resiliency of our underlying businesses, I will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted earnings per share expectation ranges in 2021, 2022, and 2023, while at the same time maintaining our strong credit ratings, we remain intensely focused on execution and continuing to drive shareholder value over the coming years.  Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners, which delivered a total unit return – unitholder return of approximately 32% in 2020 further advancing its history of value creation since the IPO. NextEra Energy Partners is uniquely positioned to take advantage of the disruptive factors reshaping the energy industry and benefit from the enormous market opportunity in the coming decades for renewables.  NextEra Energy Partners also had a terrific year of execution in 2020 and continued to deliver on its commitments that history of execution is supported by NextEra Energy Partners’ outstanding portfolio of clean energy assets, which was further diversified in 2020. During the year, NextEra Energy Partners enquired interests in approximately 1100-megawatts of high-quality renewable energy assets including the Partnership’s first battery storage project from Energy Resources.  Additionally, during the year, NextEra Energy Partners successfully completed its first three organic growth prospects, including the repowering of 275-megawatts of new projects. For 2020, NextEra Energy Partners grewitsL.P. distributions by 15% year-over-year and delivered 40% year-over-year cash available for distribution growth, highlighting the strength of its operating portfolio.  With this strong year-over-year growth and cash available for distribution, NextEra Energy Partners achieved its distribution growth objectives, while maintaining a trailing 12 month payout ratio in the high 60% range as of yearend 2020.  In the fourth quarter, we published our first NextEra Energy Partners ESG report, highlighting its high quality clean energy portfolio, visible opportunities for renewables growth, and ability to leverage the operational expertise of NextEra Energy Resources.  The continued origination success at Energy Resources is expected to benefit NextEra Energy Partners in meeting its future growth objectives. I continue to believe that the combination of NextEra Energy Partners’ clean energy portfolio, growth visibility and flexibility to finance that growth offers L.P. unitholders a uniquely attractive investor value proposition.  As with NextEra Energy, we remain intensely focused on continuing to execute and deliver that unitholder value over the coming years.  Finally, I would like to take a moment to thank all of NextEra Energy’s employees for their continued dedication, hard work and focus during the extraordinary circumstances of the past year. Despite the significant disruption caused by the pandemic, and in amidst of the most active hurricane season in the Atlantic Basin on record, our employees’ unwavering focus on our customers is what enabled the yet another year of flawless execution in the business, while also delivering our best ever safety results across the company.  It is because of their commitment to excellence that we were able to deliver above and beyond our commitments in 2020, and why I remain as confident as ever in our ability to deliver on all our expectations moving forward.  With that, I’ll now turn the call over to Rebecca, who will review the 2020 results in more detail. 
Rebecca Kujawa : Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Let’s now turn to the detailed results beginning with FPL. For the fourth quarter of 2020, FPL reported net income of $502 million or $0.25 per share, up $0.05 per share year-over-year. For the full year 2020, FPL reported net income of $2.65 billion or $1.35 per share, an increase of $0.15 per share versus 2019.  Regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 11% for 2020 and was the principal driver of FPL’s net income growth of more than 13% for the year. FPL’s capital expenditures were approximately $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter bringing its full year capital investments to a total of roughly $6.7 billion.  FPL’s reported ROE for regulatory purposes was 11.6% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, which is at the upper-end of the allowed band of 9.6% to 11.6% under our current rate agreement. During the fourth quarter, we utilized approximately $100 million of reserve amortization, leaving FPL with a year 2020 balance of $894 million.  Approximately, $206 million of reserve amortization was used to offset the restoration costs associated with hurricanes Isaias and Tropical Storm Eta which FPL elected not to recover from customers through a surcharge. FPL’s reserve amortization mechanism under its current settlement agreement, combined with our aggressive cost-cutting measures and the benefits of tax reform provided significant customer benefits including avoided surcharges for approximately $1.7 billion in storm restoration cost since 2017.  Our overall capital program at FPL is progressing well. We continue to advance one of the nation’s largest ever solar expansions. During the year, the Florida Public Service Commission approved FPL’s Solar Together program, which is the nation’s largest community solar program that is expected to generate $249 million in total net cost savings for participating and non-participating customers over the program’s life. After commissioning over 1100 megawatts or more than 3.5 times the amount of solar capacity in 2020 versus the prior year, FPL expects to commission roughly 670 megawatts of additional Solar Together capacity in 2021 and the customer demand for this innovative program across all customer classes remains strong.  Beyond solar, construction of the highly efficient, roughly 1200-megawatt Dania Beach Clean Energy Center remains on schedule and on budget as it continues to advance towards its projected commercial operations date in 2022. It should be noted that all of these significant accomplishments including the deployment of nearly $7 billion in capital, we are in the midst of not only a global pandemic, but also during the most active hurricane season in the Atlantic basin on record.  We’ve delivered our best ever reliability results when our customers needed us the most. And we remain committed to supporting customers experiencing economic hardship as a result of the challenges caused by the pandemic. To-date, FPL has provided customers with approximately $75 million in relief through various programs and initiatives.  As Florida recovers, we will continue to help our customers navigate this difficult time, while maintaining our best-in-class customer value proposition.  Let me now turn to Gulf Power, which as a reminder was legally merged into FPL on January 1st 2021, but will continue to be reported as a separate regulated segment during 2021. Gulf Power reported fourth quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $53 million or $0.03 per share, up $0.02 per share year-over-year. For the full year, Gulf Power reported net income of $238 million or $0.12 per share, an increase of $0.02 per share year-over-year on an adjusted basis.  Base O&M reductions were the primary driver of Gulf Power’s 19% year-over-year growth and adjusted earnings. Gulf Power’s reported ROE for regulatory purposes is expected to be approximately 11.1% for the 12 months ending December 2020, which is near the upper end of the allowed band of 9.25% to 11.25% under its current rate agreement.  For the full year 2021, we expect that regulatory ROE to be in the upper half of this allowed band assuming normal weather and operating conditions. All of our major capital initiatives at Gulf Power are progressing well. Gulf Power’s first solar development project, the roughly 75-Megawatt Blue Indigo Solar Energy Center went into service in 2020 and is expected to generate significant customer savings over its lifetime.  Gulf Power anticipates bringing another 150-Megawatts of cost-effective zero emission solar capacity online later this year. The North Florida resiliency connection, which among other things will allow customers to benefit from greater diversity in solar output across two different time zones is expected to be in service in mid-2022.  Continued smart capital investments such as these renewables and core infrastructure are expected to drive customer benefits for many years to come. The Florida economy continues to recover from the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. A number of current economic indicators including retail taxable sales, new building permits and consumer confidence have meaningfully improved since the start of the pandemic in early 2020.  Additionally, Florida’s most recent seasonally adjusted unemployment rate of 6.4% is below the national average. While it is unclear at this point how the economy will be impacted by the current wave of COVID-19 cases, we continue to believe that Florida offers a unique proposition in terms of housing affordability, great weather, low taxes and a pro-business economy, all of which should support ongoing FPL customer growth and economic rebound once the worst of the pandemic is behind us.  We remain deeply engaged in helping Florida return from this stronger than ever and we will continue to do our part to support that outcome including pursuing our smart capital investment program and economic development efforts, which help create jobs, provide investment in local communities and further enhance our best-in-class customer value proposition.  During the quarter, FPL’s average customer growth was strong increasing by nearly 76,000 from the comparable prior year quarter. FPL’s fourth quarter retail sales were up 0.9% versus the prior year period, largely driven by a 2.3% year-over-year growth and underlying usage per customer. For 2020, FPL’s retail sales increased 1.5% versus the prior year, driven primarily by ongoing strong growth in customers and a favorable weather comparison.  On a weather-normalized basis, FPL’s retail sales increased by 0.7% for the full year 2020. The overall impacts of the pandemic on last year’s retail sales were relatively muted and FPL’s underlying usage per customer was flat year-over-year.  For Gulf Power, the average number of customers increased approximately 0.9% versus the comparable prior year quarter. For 2020, Gulf Power’s retail sales declined 3.3% primarily as a result of a more favorable weather in the prior year, as well as lower usage per customer, which we attribute in part to the ongoing impacts of the pandemic on our commercial and industrial customers.  As Jim mentioned, FPL is preparing to file a base rate adjustment proposal that would cover the next four years, 2022, through 2025 and provide customers longer term visibility to the future cost of electricity. While the details are still being finalized, we expect the proposal to include base rate adjustments of approximately $1.1 billion starting in January of 2022 and $615 million starting in January of 2023.  We also expect the proposal to request support for continued deployment of cost-effective solar with the continuation of our solar base rate adjustment or silver mechanism to recover the revenue requirements associated with up to 900-megawatts of cost-effective solar projects in each of 2024 and 2025, which we currently estimate to be approximately $140 million each year.  For the period 2019 through the end of 2022, FPL is planning to have invested approximately $29 billion with additional significant investments expected in 2023 and beyond to meet the growing needs of Florida’s economy and to continue delivering outstanding value for Florida customers by keeping reliability high and fuel and other costs low.  While the benefits of building a stronger, smarter, and cleaner grid, more efficient generation fleet are passed along regularly to customers through higher service reliability and lower bills. We must periodically seek recovery for these long-term investments supported by base rates.  As we’ve previously indicated, we plan to request the commission authorized unified rates and capital structure for both FPL and Gulf Power customers. We believe the combination of the two businesses will result in approximately $2.8 billion of savings for customers through those operational savings and overall system benefits.  FPL expects to request an 11.5% ROE inclusive of a 50 basis point incentive for superior performance. Compared with peer utilities in the southeastern U.S., FPL has the most efficient – most cost-efficient operations, the highest reliability, the lowest customer bills, all while remaining one of the cleanest utilities in the country and is widely regarded as the top overall performer in the industry bringing exceptional value to customers.  We believe that the performance adder would reflect FPL’s current superior value proposition and encourage strong – continued strong performance. In addition, we continue to believe that a strong balance sheet, including strong credit ratings remains critical to ensure FPL maintains uninterrupted access to the capital markets even in times of significant market disruptions in the aftermath of hurricanes, as well to attract capital to support the investments FPL is making to further improve the value we offer our customers.  The total of these base rate increase requests over the four year period from 2022 to 2025 would result in an estimated average increase in total revenues of about 3.7% per year. Today, FPL’s typical residential bill is about 30% lower than the national average, if the full amount of the requests were granted under our proposal and assuming other utilities experience bill increases only at their historical rate of increase, FPL’s typical customer bills would remain significantly lower than the national average through 2025.  To put this proposal in context, the proposal would result in a typical customer bill in January 2022, that is nearly 22% less than it was in real terms fifteen years ago, even with our proposed base rate increases. Even in nominal terms, FPL bills would be only about 3.5% higher in 2022 than in 2006, a fraction that the nominal increases of 25% to 75% in the cost of groceries, medical care, health insurance and housing over the past 15 years.  Moreover, through the consolidation of FPL and Gulf Power, the typical 1000-kilowatt hour residential customer bill in Northwest Florida is projected to be lower in 2025 than it was in 2019. We look forward to the opportunity to present the details of our case and expect to make our formal filing with testimony and required detailed data in March.  The timing for the proceeding will ultimately be determined by the commission. But we currently expect that we will have hearings in the third quarter and a final commission decision in the fourth quarter and time for new rates to go into effect in January of 2022.  As always, we are open to the possibility of resolving our rate request through a fair settlement agreement. During the course of the past 22 years, FPL has entered into six multi-year settlement agreements, that has provided customers with a high degree of rate stability and certainty and helped FPL execute to deliver its best-in-class customer value proposition.  Our core focus will be to pursue a fair and objective review of our case that supports continued execution of our successful strategy for customers. And we will continue to provide updates throughout the process.  Energy Resources reported fourth quarter 2020 GAAP loss of $644 million or $0.33 per share. Adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter was $342 million or $0.17 per share. Energy Resources contribution to adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter is flat versus the prior year comparable period as favorable results from the continued growth and performance in our renewables portfolio were roughly offset by a number of items none of which are particularly noteworthy.  For the full year, Energy Resources reported GAAP earnings of $531 million or $0.27 per share and adjusted earnings of $1.95 billion or $0.99 per share. Energy Resources full year adjusted earnings per share contribution increased $0.12 or approximately 14% versus 2019. For the full year growth was driven by continued new additions to our renewables portfolio as contributions from new investments increased by $0.07 per share.  Contributions from existing generation assets increased $0.03 versus 2019, due primarily to increased production tax credit volume from our repowered wind projects and an improvement in wind resource, which were partially offset by the planned nuclear outages and retirement of our Duane Arnold nuclear facility.  Also contributing favorably was NextEra Energy Transmission, which increased results by $0.02 year-over-year, primarily as a result of full year contributions from Trans Bay Cable acquisition that closed in the middle of 2019. Contributions from all other impacts were flat year-over-year.  Amid the disruption of the pandemic, Energy Resources had one of its best years ever including successfully executing on the largest construction program in our history, as well as delivering our best year ever for originations, adding a net nearly 7000-Megawatts of new renewables projects to our backlog.  In 2020, we commissioned about 5750-Megawatts of wind, solar and storage projects on schedule and on budget. In addition, since the last call, we have added approximately 2000-Megawatts of renewables projects to our backlog including approximately 1030-Megawatts of new wind and wind repowerings, 670-Megawatts of solar, and 300-Megawatts of battery storage including 75 additional megawatts of capacity on Desert Peak storage, which is now expected to total 400-Megawatts and remains the world’s largest standalone storage project.  Following the terrific origination year in 2020, our renewables backlog now stands at approximately 13,500-Megawatts. Despite a record year of megawatts placed in service, Energy Resources grew its yearend backlog by approximately 1500-Megawatts year-over-year providing terrific visibility to the strong growth that lies ahead.  Since 2017, our backlog additions have grown at a roughly 25% compound annual growth rate. As a result of our tremendous progress in 2020 and our strong continued origination success, we are raising our 2021 to 2022 renewables development expectations to a range of 10,525-Megawatts to 12,700-Megawatts, which at the midpoint is approximately 3500-Megawatts above our previous expectations.  Our expectations for 2021 and 2022 are now up more than 50% at the midpoint relative to the expectations that we laid out at the 2019 investor conference reflecting the significant acceleration of renewables activity over the past year-and-a-half.  We are also introducing our 2023 to 2024 renewables development expectations of 12,150-Megawatts to 17,300-Megawatts. This is by far the largest expected two year development program in our history and reflects our high level of confidence in Energy Resources’ ongoing leadership position and renewables energy development. The accompanying slide provide some additional details.  As we’ve previously discussed, we are optimistic about the we are optimistic about the expanded investment opportunities that the broad decarbonization of the U.S. economy presents for Energy Resources, and we are pursuing a number of pilot projects to rapidly develop our capabilities across this potential investment opportunity set. Today, we are announcing a new innovative green hydrogen project at Energy Resources that includes a 12-Megawatt solar array, onsite hydrogen production and storage, and a hydrogen fuel cell. This emissions-free project will utilize solar energy to create green hydrogen to power the fuel cell, which will be able to provide electricity to the local grid during periods of peak demands. Subject to final terms and regulatory approvals, this approximately $20 million innovative green hydrogen project is expected to begin construction in 2022 with commercial operations in mid-2023. Energy Resources is also in advanced discussions with a number of potential customers across the industrial landscape, including food processing, specialty chemicals and refineries to continue to develop clean energy solutions for a more efficient green production processes.  One potential project includes a solar tracker combined with an electrolyzer at a large industrial plant. The project would deliver green hydrogen as an industrial feedstock to the facility and we are not producing hydrogen, the solar power would offset a portion of the plant's energy consumption further decarbonizing the facility's operations. In addition, today, Energy Resources announced a planned partnership to preserve – pursue large school bus fleet conversions to electric and hydrogen with the nation's largest school bus owner and operator and transportation services provider. With its partner, Energy Resources anticipates investing in bus electrification upgrades and charging stations, as well as providing energy management services.  This transaction is consistent with our toe in the water approach, as we explore potential opportunities in the electrification of the transportation sector. We are excited about all of these opportunities, as well as the previously announced hydrogen pilot project, we plan to propose at FPL's Okeechobee Clean Energy Center, which highlight the significant opportunities that the broad decarbonization of the U.S. economy presents.  Consistent with our long-term track record, NextEra Energy will remain disciplined as we take steps to be at the forefront of these developing markets while taking a leadership role in the clean energy transition.  Beyond renewables and storage, since the last earnings call, Mountain Valley Pipeline made progress with its outstanding permitting issues, including receiving the Bureau of Land Management Right-of-Way Grants, which authorizes MVP to cross the Jefferson National Forest once the stream and wetland permitting is complete.  While the Fourth Circuit denied the stay request on MVP's new biological opinion, the court did grant a stay on the Nationwide 12 Permit, and the project is now pursuing an alternate path forward to permit and complete stream and wetland crossings. Due to these continued legal and regulatory issues, as well as the substantial delays in commercial operation and increased costs associated with those delays, the carrying value for our investment in MVP now exceeds its fair market value and as a result, we have reflected a 1 to – $1.2 billion after-tax impairment in our GAAP financial statements, which we have excluded from adjusted earnings.  While we are disappointed with the extended development and construction timeline due to the legal challenges that the project has faced, we intend to continue pursuing completing the project with our partners. Finally, during 2020, NextEra Energy Transmission furthered its efforts to grow America's leading competitive transmission company and had its best year ever. During the year, the business delivered record earnings contribution and realized constructive rate case outcomes at Trans Bay Cable and Lone Star Transmission, as well as entered into an agreement to acquire GridLiance, which owns three FERC-regulated transmission utilities spanning six states.  We continue to expect to obtain all necessary regulatory approvals and close on the GridLiance acquisition in the first half of this year. Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the fourth quarter of 2020, GAAP net losses attributable to NextEra Energy were $5 million or $0.00 per share. NextEra Energy's 2020 fourth quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $785 million or $0.40 per share respectively.  For the full year 2020, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $2.92 billion or $1.48 per share. Adjusted earnings were $4.55 billion or $2.31 per share. As a reminder, all of our financial results have been adjusted to account for the four-for-one stock split, which became effective in the fourth quarter. For the Corporate and Other segments, adjusted earnings for the full year decreased $0.07 per share compared to the 2019 prior comparable period, primarily as a result of higher interest in refinancing costs associated with certain liability management initiatives completed during the fourth quarter to take advantage of the low interest rate environment.  In total, for NextEra Energy, our refinancing activities reduced nominal adjusted net income by roughly $103 million during the fourth quarter, inclusive of approximately $39 million associated with Energy Resources' share of refinancing cost at NextEra Energy Partners. We expect these initiatives to translate into favorable net income contributions in future years and an overall improvement in net present value for our shareholders. Long-term financial expectations, which we increased and extended late last year through 2023 remain unchanged. For 2021, NextEra Energy expects adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.40 to $2.54. For 2022 and 2023, NextEra Energy expects to grow 6% to 8% of the expected 2021 adjusted earnings per share, and we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of these ranges.  From 2018 to 2023, we continue to expect that operating cash flow will grow roughly in line with our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. We also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at a roughly 10% per year rate through at least 2022 off of a 2020 base. As always, our expectations assume normal weather and operating conditions. Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners, which also had a strong year of operational and financial performance in 2020. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $308 million and cash available for distribution was $106 million, an increase of 10% and 8% from the prior year period respectively.  EBITDA growth was driven primarily by favorable resource across the portfolio and the full contributions from new projects acquired in late 2019, and it was slightly offset by a planned outage at our Genesis project late in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2020, adjusted EBITDA was $1.263 billion, up 14% year-over-year. Cash available for distribution was $570 million, an increase of 40% from the prior year. Similar to the quarterly results, full year growth in adjusted EBITDA was primarily driven by full year contributions from acquisitions in the prior year and favorable wind resource.  For the full year, wind resource was 100% of the long-term average versus 97% in 2019. The benefit to cash available for distribution from lower project-level debt service was partially offset by higher corporate level interest expense. As a reminder, these results include the impact of IDR fees, which we treat as an operating expense. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide.  Yesterday, the NextEra Energy Partners Board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.615 per common unit or $2.46 per unit on an annualized basis, up 15% from the comparable quarterly distribution a year earlier and at the top-end of the range we discussed going into 2020.  During 2020, NextEra Energy Partners executed several financings to support its ongoing growth investments and optimize its capital structure for the benefit of LP unitholders. As Jim mentioned, during the quarter, we closed on an acquisition from Energy Resources of interest in an approximately 1100-Megawatt portfolio of long-term contracted renewables projects.  As part of this transaction, NextEra Energy Partners raised a 10-year, approximately $1.1 billion convertible equity portfolio financing, that includes the acquired assets, plus four existing NextEra Energy Partners' wind and solar projects. Combining this acquisition with the recapitalization of four existing NextEra Energy Partners' assets through the longest dated and lowest cost convertible equity portfolio financing in the partnership's history is expected to provide significant benefits for unitholders.  By leveraging the strong demand for high quality clean energy assets, NextEra Energy Partners was able to secure financing for both the current transaction and future growth, while enhancing returns for L.P. unitholders and limiting downside risk.  NextEra Energy Partners expects to further strengthen its balance sheet and have access to approximately $2.4 billion in available financing capacity, including capacity under its corporate revolving credit facility and commitments from investors to potential future convertible equity portfolio financings, which further supports the Partnership's long-term growth. During the second half of the year, NextEra Energy Partners completed the successful conversion of approximately $300 million of convertible debt and the remaining balance of the convertible preferred securities that were issued in 2017 into approximately 5.7 million units and 4.7 million units - common units respectively.  These conversions help NextEra Energy Partners achieve its goal of using low-cost financing products to efficiently issue equity over time.  Finally, NextEra Energy Partners raised approximately $600 million in new 0% coupon convertible notes during the quarter and used the net proceeds from this offering to redeem a portion of its outstanding 4.25% senior notes due in 2024. Coincident with the issuance of the convertible notes, NextEra Energy Partners entered into a capped call structure that will result in NextEra Energy Partners retaining up to 90% of the upside in its unit price associated with the convertible notes over the next five years.  NextEra Energy Partners' runrate expectations for adjusted EBITDA and CAFD at December 31st 2021 remain unchanged.  Year-end 2021 runrate adjusted EBITDA expectations are $1.44 billion to $1.62 billion and CAFD in the range of $600 million to $680 million. As a reminder, all of our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and include the impact of anticipated IDR fees, as we treat these as an operating expense.  From an updated base of our fourth quarter 2020 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $2.46, we continue to see 12% to 15% growth per year in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2024. We expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2021 distribution that is payable in February of 2022 to be in a range of $2.76 to $2.83 per common unit. In summary, we continue to believe that both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners have excellent prospects for growth both in the near and longer-term. FPL, Energy Resources and NextEra Energy Partners each have outstanding set of opportunities across the board.  The progress we’ve made in 2020 reinforces our longer-term growth prospects and while we have a lot to execute on in 2021, we believe that we have the building blocks in place for another excellent year. \ That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we'll open up the line for your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. 
Steve Fleishman : Yes. Couple questions. Just first – just a clean up on the MVP announcement. Could you just talk about, maybe a little more color on what you need to get that done and when and why? 
Rebecca Kujawa: Sure. Thanks, Steve. And we appreciate the question. First, obviously, the project has taken longer and cost more than what we anticipated. And so the impairment is really related to reflecting not only that value that we have on our books, but really in relation to what we believe is the current fare on valuation for the investment given what we do still have to accomplish.  And obviously a lot changed in the fourth quarter including the nationwide 12 permits stay that I mentioned in the prepared remarks, as well as the various things that have happened in January and against a backdrop of obvious changes including the change in the administration, including the change in control of the Senate which happened here in January.  So, the impairment does reflects our view of what we still need to accomplish and the associated fair values related to the chances of being able to successfully execute on that. But this was an accounting exercise. There was a lot of due diligence that we needed to evaluate and we think we’ve made the appropriate changes. But it does not change our commitment to work with our partners to put this project into service.  So, as I noted in the comments, we do have now a path that we are going to pursue in terms of the outstanding permitting. We work closer with our partners to pursue that path. But we felt it was appropriate and obviously took the actions that we did with respect to the impairment. 
Steve Fleishman : Okay. And then, just on the continued higher growth in renewables, could you maybe just touch a little bit on funding plans for that over the period, just high level?
Rebecca Kujawa: Super high level. As you know, we’ve prided ourselves in a variety of approaches to the capital markets to support our business retaining all of those options as circumstances change is one of the things that I think has been particularly successful for us over a long period of time. One aspect at this point I wouldn’t expect to change, particularly as it relates to financing the projects of energy resources is that we will continue to execute a significant amount of tax equity, given our current position and tax capacity.  But I think it’s all of the tools in the toolbox that you would expect us to utilize to finance the business. But our commitment to our strong balance sheet remains unchanged and we will grow both profitably and maintaining a strong balance sheet. 
Steve Fleishman : Great. And then, last, maybe, kind of a strategic question, I guess for Jim. Just the – as we see the continued – just dramatic ramp up in renewable growth and the revaluation of the company probably tied to that and what does it mean for some of the statements you’ve made in the past on utility M&A? Does it make it more likely, because you need to balance the mix or less likely because there is just so much opportunity on this other side of the business? 
Jim Robo: So, Steve, obviously, the relative valuation of the two big businesses has changed over the last several years, right? And that’s just accelerated over – in particular over the last 24 months. I think what that means is it’s changed a bit of our analytic framework of how we think about utility M&A.  On the one hand, I continue to believe that there is enormous value creation that we can bring to the table and you only need to look at what we’ve been able to do with Gulf in the last 24.5 months to see how much value creation, bringing our playbook and our operating platform to bear can create, right?  So, that is – that I think remains clear and if anything is clear to me. On the other, I think it’s also clear that, probably a sweet spot for us in terms of M&A is, things in the less than $20 billion range that we can pay cash and finance through the normal course. And at that point, if you do that, you are not shifting the mix one way or another all that tremendously and in our set of analytics, we are looking really more at how much value creation we bring to the table when we do this.  And so, for example, like at Santee Cooper is a great example of that. That’s a – it’s a roughly $8 billion or $9 billion transaction. And something that we can finance in the normal course and a place where we think we can create enormous value very quickly.  And so, that’s the kind of things that we are focused on and – but most importantly, we are focused on running the business and executing, staying financially disciplined as we always have been and executing against the terrific growth prospects we have in energy resources and then executing at FPL as we always have for the benefit of our customers and continuing and for benefit the state.  So, that I think is a – just a little different overview of how our current status of our thinking on. 
Steve Fleishman : Great. Okay. Thanks so much. 
Operator: The next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Please go ahead. 
Julien Dumoulin-Smith : Hey, good morning, team. Thanks for the time. I’ll make it brief. If I can, just coming back to renewable expectations, now redefined upsized expectations over the longer term here, can you talk about a few factors here? First, C&I, you guys haven’t been as involved. It seems like that could be accelerating here. Can you talk about how that’s sheltered into your expectations?  Secondly, the new expectations explicitly do not include any future build on transfer. How do you see that is incremental and any heuristics you might offer as to how to think about value creation there?  And a third one on that if I can just throw in there is the attach rates on storage. It seems like, the bulk of the storage that you are talking about in the future is probably tied to your solar assets. How do you think about standalone as being incremental to what you talk about already? I’ll leave with that. 
Rebecca Kujawa: Okay Julien, thanks for the questions and you may need to prompt me if I forgot one or more aspects of the multipart question. Let me start with C&I. As I highlighted in the prepared remarks, John and his team across Energy Resources have really cultivated a nice suite of opportunities with C&I customers.  And if we look at our core base of other major investor on utilities, our munis and coops and our C&I business, other investor on utilities and muni coops are still large overall, but the opportunity set with C&I customers is definitely growing, not just in your standard PPA, but more in the suite of types of opportunities that I mentioned as one of the pilot projects that John and his team are pursuing, kind of more holistic energy solution provider to these C&I customers.  And I think what’s really changed over the last year plus, maybe it’s even two years is the inbound request to C&I has really expanded as they really start to look at their own carbon footprint, their own ESG messaging, how do they source energy to do their business and how do they source that from a cleaner energy solutions has become a higher topic of interest and higher priority for them and therefore terrific opportunity set for us. So I think that that’s a growing opportunity for us that we continue to be really excited about.  In terms of build-own transfers, we will continue to present our expectations, both our expectations and our signed contracts consistent in a way that we’ve shown that in the past that there will be some build-own transfer on the Energy Resources pursues, if it is a strict just sell the project to somebody else, we think there is a lot of value creation there, but we won’t necessarily incorporate in our backlog for purposes of reporting unless there is a long-term operation and maintenance or other stream of revenue to us that we benefit from.  So we’ll consistently report that. I think the opportunity set is there for both traditional build-own transfers, as well as build-own transfers where we provide some incremental long-term value to our customers.  And then finally, storage, the opportunity set is terrific. Obviously, we’ve had tremendous success in attaching storage to new solar facilities, existing solar facilities, and even some standalone storage projects.  If there is a standalone storage incentive that Congress pursues, obviously that would support near-term growth of standalone storage opportunities even beyond what we’ve seen. But the growth is terrific and as we outlined back in 2019, we were surprised how fast the market evolved and I think we continue to be really supportive of that overall market.  And one last thing I’ll highlight, Julien is, is really the innovative nature of the FPL team in working with the Solar Together program to work with our commercial and industrial customers in Florida to support their needs to build the most cost-effective solar. And that’s what the Solar Together program offered is the ability to really source clean energy solutions in the most profitable way for them and in a way that we structured at the benefits both those participating customers and non-participating customers to meet their needs.  Don’t mix up there Julien. Did I miss any aspect of it? 
Julien Dumoulin-Smith : Just the standalone piece. I mean, how incremental is that and to what your view? 
Rebecca Kujawa: The standalone storage, as an investment opportunity? 
Julien Dumoulin-Smith : Yes, absolutely. 
Rebecca Kujawa: Yes, over time, Julien, it could be very significant. In the short-term, is it imperative for renewables’ growth, and in certain pockets, yes, broadly speaking, no. But as you start to see what we referenced today, trillions of dollars of renewable deployment over time increasing storage deployment both in the forms of batteries, as well as other forms of long duration storage which we believe includes hydrogen will become not only increasingly important, but a very large capital investment opportunity. 
Jim Robo: Yes. And just to add, Julien, on what Rebecca said, I mean, Desert Peak, which we announced today 400 megawatts larger standalone project in the world. So, we are actively seeking out standalone opportunities and having the largest solar fleet in North America positions us for storage add-on. So, a tremendous amount of leverage up the operating fleet.  And with new origination, I think of attach rates being roughly 60% on all the new stuff that we do. And then, one more comment on C&I, we are positioning the business to be the preferred strategic partner with C&I customers.  And we are looking at the business in a holistic way where we can provide clean energy solutions across the board, it’s wind, it’s solar, it’s storage, it’s hydrogen, it’s mobility, the First Student transaction that we just announced today. It’s an energy management services capability. It’s analytics. All the things we’ve done for decades, we can now offer to C&I customers and we’ve got a huge head start. 
Julien Dumoulin-Smith : Great guys. Thank you. I’ll pass it on. 
Rebecca Kujawa: Thanks, Julien. 
Operator: The next question is from Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. 
Shar Pourreza : Hey, good morning, guys. 
Rebecca Kujawa: Good morning, Shar. 
Shar Pourreza : Just a couple quick questions, on the rate case in particular, obviously, we have a March filing that’s ahead of us. And one of the sort of the big moving piece is the rate base, it’s 11% year-over-year growth for FPL, 24% for Gulf. As we sort of think about like the cap structure improvement especially for Gulf, the ROE add or the capital plan request, how do we sort of think about sort of the filing?  Does it kind of relates to your current growth guide as it’s effective well within your current trajectory is like – is the filing consistent with the top end and extends the runway. Is it better? And more importantly, as we sort of think about you rolling forward the plan into 2024 is that kind of a post-GRC decision? 
Rebecca Kujawa:
. : From a NextEra Energy perspective, as you would expect, when we provide expectations, we do a variety of scenario planning analysis to feel comfortable with the expectations that we’ve laid out. So, there is not one answer to what do you have in your assumptions that you’ve laid for expectations. There is a range and we feel comfortable today as we’ve obviously reiterated those expectations for the 2021, 2022 and 2023 timeframes.  So we look forward to presenting our case to the commission and shareholders. We feel very confident in the decisions that we’ve made in terms of where we’ve been investing, where we plan to invest. And obviously the results, into some measure obviously speaks for themselves in terms of low bills, high reliability, terrific customer service, and a clean energy profile that is substantial and we are obviously looking forward to not only telling that story, but also the Gulf changes over the last couple of years that Jim highlighted.  So, we’ll have more as the process unfolds and obviously, when we have – we finally have clarity on the rate case outcome or a potential settlement if we are so fortunate as to reach a constructive agreement with interveners, we’ll provide some updates once we have that information. 
Shar Pourreza : Got it. And then, just as we think about rolling the consolidated outlook into 2021, is that a post-GRC decision or settlement? 
Rebecca Kujawa: So, 2021 obviously assumes the current rate agreements, since both for FPL and Gulf, they go to see the 2021 timeframe. And then, 2022 and 2023, again I’ll put in context a variety of scenarios that we assume for both FPL and Energy Resources to support the expectations that we’ve laid out. 
Shar Pourreza : Got it. And then, just maybe a quick strategy question for Jim. And Jim obviously, with Santee Cooper in particular, the sales discussions have been steadily growing and interest in the legislator. What do you sort of think will be different in 2021 either from the legislator side or the NEE side? I.e. would you sort of anticipate making a substantially similar bid if the process comes up for sale?  And then, just on for transmission, obviously you highlighted the GridLiance acquisition last year. How do you sort of see that opportunity set on the sort of transmission side? How large do you want NextEra Transmission to be as part of the business mix? Do you see any – is there more to come there? 
Jim Robo: So, first of all on Santee Cooper, well, there is an offer on the table and that offer remains on the table and as does our $25 million deposit, which the state still has. So, the offer is there and we are ready to negotiate whenever the state is ready to get going. And so, we stand ready and are hopeful that the legislator will move forward on that process. And we’ll know more obviously over the next 90 days or so.  On NextEra Energy Transmission, I think, Rebecca in her prepared remarks had just a terrific year last year, their best year ever as a company. Remember, we started that business from scratch, little over ten years ago and it’s a business that made over $100 million in net income last year and we think has the ability to grow mid-teens double-digit over the next several years just organically with what they have in front of them without doing any other acquisitions and we are pursuing other acquisitions there, because we think we add an enormous amount of value through our operating model, number one.  And then number two, probably the biggest inhibitor to renewable in this country is not consumer demand or it is not interest on the part of the Federal government or state governments to get renewable builds. It’s not that customers don’t want it. It is fundamentally broken processes with the ISOs in terms of how they manage their queues and transmission and just broadly transmission planning in this country.  And I think with the Biden administration and a new FERC, there is a new opportunity to fix that. And our transmission business I think is a great example of what FERC Order 1000 can do when you get competition going in the transmission world and it is also, I think every bit of transmission we build in that business is incremental and helpful to the renewable business that we have and that it makes the delivery of lower cost renewable even more fast to come on to the grid than they otherwise would.  So, I am very excited about transmission business. We are going to continue to push it and I think it’s got a lot of runway to grow. 
Shar Pourreza : Terrific. Thanks for that. And congrats on the results. 
Operator: The next question is from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. 
Michael Lapides : Thank you for taking my question. I actually have two. One is, your post-integrate 2020 with EPS growth north of 10%, just curious, do you think you could potentially come in above the high end of your range? So is kind of the 6% to 8% target a very modest target growth when you think about the next couple of years given the runrate you hit this past year? 
Rebecca Kujawa: So, Michael, I appreciate and I appreciate the optimism and the support that that your question might suggest. We are really proud of the results for 2020. There is a couple of things to remind you. One, that does include some incremental contributions from Gulf and obviously we expected Gulf in the deal for our Florida acquisitions and we expect some incremental benefit from that for 2021 as we highlighted in the – when we laid out expectations initially.  And then, just recall, we did raised our 2021 expectations late last year and the rebased our 6% to 8% off of that higher base. We are really excited about both the positioning of the regulated utilities, as well as Energy Resources going into 2021. We know what we need to accomplish and the teams are set out to go after and achieve those objectives. And of course, we’ll update you over time as we go through the year. But for today, we have reiterated those expectations of the $2.40 to $2.54 for 2021. 
Michael Lapides : Got it. And then, a follow-up one and it’s more of a policy one and I think it’s more of the state policy one. There is still lots of coal generation in rate base in a lot of states. Not all of which probably is economic.  But the owners of that and clearly your Florida utility don’t have exposure to this. The owners of that benefit from having a rate base. How do you, from an earnings perspective, how do you think that dichotomy, Jim, gets resolved over time? And are there lessons that other states can learn from Florida that might be able to haze in the pace of fleet transformation? 
Jim Robo: So, Michael, I think you are being kind honestly to the regulated coal fleet in this country. There is not a regulated coal plant in this country that is economic today full period and stop when it’s dispatched on any basis, not a single one, okay. And so, why haven’t it – I think you’ve hit on the crux of some of the issues.  Obviously, there have been, in certain states, a reluctance to what our utility customers retire the coal plant and then will be able to recover their investment, right? And so, of course, if you run a utility, you don’t want to retire an asset that you are going to then either have to write-off or not be able to earn on, right?  I think one of the things that has been really constructive and very smart about the Florida regulatory environment and Florida Commission’s view on a modernizing generation fleet is that they have – we’ve spread that capital recovery over a period of five or ten years. And that has both I think moderated the impact of customer builds on the one hand and also on the other, given us the right incentive to do the right thing by our customers and bring on lower cost generation.  So, I think it’s about – the other piece I think that’s going to change is, there is no question this administration through the EPA and other means is going to make the continued operation of coal plants very difficult in this country. And so, there is going to be, I think more pressure, more Federal pressure to accelerate that transition away from coal than there has been, obviously over the last four years where there has been, in fact, the opposite of Federal pressure.  But the complete lack of Federal pressure do anything about with your coal fleet. So, I think the combination of that, plus states becoming – it become clear and clear the economics as we go along that the operating cost of coal plants are higher than the new build cost of renewable with storage is that becomes even clearer as cost come down.  For renewables when cost continue to go up, for operating cost continue to go up for coal, that’s – I mean, the bottom-line, in Florida, we’ve shut our coal down and we save customers literally billions of dollars of present value over the expected life of the new generation that we’ve put in place. So, there is an enormous opportunity.  There is several states in the country that are not taking advantage of that opportunity, because of some of the regulatory approaches. And honestly, I think with the new administration and some of the policies there, that’s going to accelerate the replacement of coal in this country and it should be, because there is no – it costing customers’ money.  Leave aside the environmental benefits just on pure economics that costing customers’ money every day and that’s bad for the country and let alone that it’s terrible for the climate. It is – and for the environment, it is bad for customers, because economics are - the coal economics are so what a whack. 
Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you, Jim. Much appreciated. And maybe one last one for Rebecca. Rebecca you outraced your renewable growth targets materially that implies higher CapEx, but obviously you get the benefit of the tax every year. So you all utilize convertible financing or equity units. Should we assume that as part of your EPS growth guidance that there is continued use of kind of new convertible units in the financing plan and maybe that level grows and scale with the change in the CapEx forecast? 
Rebecca Kujawa: Michael, I appreciate it. And I’ve talking to a couple of comments that we’ve made in the past that I know you know. First, we keep all the tools in the toolkit and we believe that at various times, various tools are more economic than others. But at the end of the day, our commitment to our balance sheet remains very strong and that we will finance it in a way that retains our strong balance sheet.  One additional thing I’ll remind you of that over time is certainly been very valuable to you is, not only maintaining the balance in our business, which we’ve talked about frequently. But if the recycling a capital as a source of proceeds to finance that new growth and as NEP grows and our recycling of capital grows to NEP, obviously, that’s also a source of financing from the new investments that Energy Resources is making.  But there was one thing that I know at the beginning of the year, we have a financing plan by the end of the year. It ends up being different than what we originally thought. But again, the most important thing to us is no matter what, we will remain committed to that balance sheet and we will finance it in a way that makes sense and it is ultimately profitable for our shareholders as well. 
Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you, Rebecca. Thank you, Jim. 
Rebecca Kujawa: Thank you very much, Michael.
Operator: This concludes our Question-And-Answer Session as well as the conference. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect.

Rebecca Kujawa: Thank you, Matt and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy delivered strong third quarter results and continue to perform well on managing the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. NextEra Energy’s third quarter adjusted earnings per share increased by more than 11% versus the prior-year comparable quarter, reflecting strong execution at Florida Power & Light Company, Gulf Power and Energy Resources. Year-to-date, we have grown adjusted earnings per share by over 10% relative to 2019. We continue to execute well on our major initiatives, including continuing to capitalize on the best renewables development period in our history and we are well positioned to meet our overall objectives for 2020 and beyond. Before moving on, I would like to say a few words about hurricanes Isaias, Laura, Sally and Delta. As you know, residents throughout the eastern and southeastern U.S. were recently impacted by the severe effects of these dangerous and deadly storms. Our deepest sympathies are with those, who have been impacted by these storms widespread destruction. We are grateful for the support that others have given us over the years and we were fortunate to be in a position to assist other utilities this year. As part of our assistance efforts, we sent several thousand of our employees and contractors as well as transmission equipment to help rebuild the grid to support the restoration efforts of the impacted utilities. Gulf Power itself was impacted by Hurricane Sally, which experienced an unexpected change in intensity and path before striking the service area. Approximately, 285,000 customers or more than 60% of Gulf Power’s customers experienced outages as Sally brought heavy rain and severe flooding. Through a restoration workforce that totaled approximately 7,000 workers, including approximately 2,000 FPL employees and contractors. Gulf Power was able to restore service to essentially all impacted customers within five days. We are pleased with the efficient and safe restoration response to Hurricane Sally, which was made more challenging by the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our focus on preparation and execution, including our annual storm drills helped ensure a timely response to the hurricane despite the pandemic. At Florida Power & Light earnings per share increased $0.14 year-over-year. All of the major capital projects including one of the largest solar expansions ever in the U.S. remain on track as we continue to advance our long-term focus on delivering outstanding customer value. FPL’s typical residential bill remains 30% below the national average and the lowest among all of the Florida investor-owned utilities. All while FPL maintains best-in-class service reliability and an emissions profile that is among the cleanest in the nation. As part of our continued focus on doing what is right for our customers, last month, FPL announced that among other measures, it was offering direct relief of up to $200 per customer to those that are experiencing hardship and are significantly behind on their bills due to COVID-19. We remain committed to supporting our customers during this challenging time. Gulf Power also had a strong quarter of execution as we continue to deliver on the cost reduction initiatives and smart capital investments that we have previously outlined. We remained focused on improving the Gulf Power customer value proposition by providing lower costs, higher reliability, outstanding customer service and clean energy solutions, and continue to expect that this strategy will generate significant customer and shareholder value over the coming years. At Energy Resources, adjusted EPS increased by roughly 23% year-over-year, building upon the success of recent quarters, our development team had the best quarter of origination in Energy Resources’ history, adding nearly 2,200 megawatts of signed contracts to our renewables backlog. After accounting for the removal of several projects, which I’ll talk about more in a moment, our backlog increased by approximately 1,450 megawatts, and now totaled more than 15,000 megawatts. To put this into perspective, our backlog, which we continue to expect and expect to construct over the next several years is now larger than Energy Resources entire existing renewables portfolio, which took us more than 20 years to complete. Our engineering and construction team also continues to execute, commissioning more than 800 megawatts since the last earnings call and keeping the remainder of the – more than 5,200 total megawatts of wind and solar projects that we’re expecting to complete this year on track to achieve their 2020 in-service dates. Overall, with three quarters complete in 2020, we are pleased with the progress we are making in NextEra Energy and are well positioned to achieve the full-year financial expectations that we’ve previously discussed, subject to our normal caveats. Now, let’s look at the detailed results beginning with FPL. With the third quarter of 2020, FPL reported net income of $757 million or $1.54 per share, an increase of $74 million and $0.14 per share respectively year-over-year. Regulatory capital employed increased by more than 11% over the same quarter last year and was the principal driver of FPL’s net income growth of roughly 11%. FPL’s capital expenditures were approximately $1.3 billion during the third quarter and we expect our full-year capital investments to total between $6.5 billion and $6.7 billion, which as a reminder, is higher than our expectations at the start of the year. Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.6% for the 12 months ending September 2020, which is at the upper end of the allowed band of 9.6% to 11.6% under our current rate agreement. During the quarter, we restored $258 million of reserve amortization to achieve our target regulatory ROE leaving FPL with a balance of $994 million. As we’ve previously discussed, we expect FPL and Gulf Power operating as a single larger Florida utility company will create both operational and financial benefits for our customers. Earlier this month, we were pleased to receive for – approval for an internal reorganization, whereby Gulf will merge into FPL in January of 2021. Gulf Power will continue as a separate operating division during 2021 serving its customers under separate retail rates. We continue to expect the companies will file a combined rate case in the first quarter of next year for new rates effective in January of 2022. Turning to our development efforts. all of our major capital initiatives at FPL are progressing well. The next six SolarTogether projects, totaling approximately 450 megawatts remain on track to be placed in service later this year. The final 600 megawatts of the roughly 1,600 megawatts community solar program are expected to be placed in service next year. This significant solar expansion combined with low-cost battery storage solutions such as Manatee Energy Storage Center that remains on track to be complete next year represent the next phase of FPL’s generation modernization efforts. Beyond solar, construction of the highly efficient roughly 1,200 megawatt Dania Beach Clean Energy Center remain on schedule and on budget as it continues to advance towards its commercial – projected commercial operations date in 2022. During the quarter, we are pleased that the Florida Public Service Commission approved FPL’s Storm Protection Plan settlement agreement that allows for clause recovery of storm hardening investments, including undergrounding. The agreement supports the continued hardening of FPL’s already storm-resilient energy grid in a programmatic manner through the deployment of billions of dollars of incremental capital for the benefit of customers. Let me now turn to Gulf Power, which reported third quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $91 million or $0.18 per share, an increase of $0.02 per share relative to Gulf Power’s adjusted earnings per share in the prior-year period. Gulf Power’s reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 10.5% for the 12 months ending September 2020. For the full-year 2020, we continue to target a regulatory ROE in the upper half of the allowed band of 9.25% to 11.25%. During the quarter, Gulf Power’s capital expenditures were roughly $350 million and we expect our full-year capital investments to total between $1 billion and $1.1 billion. All of Gulf Power’s major smart capital investments continue to progress well. The Plant Crist coal-to-natural gas conversion and associated natural gas laterals are expected to be complete later this year, supporting NextEra Energy’s coal phase-out strategy and commitment to remain a clean energy leader. Although Gulf Power has not completed the final accounting, our preliminary estimate of the Hurricane Sally recoverable storm restoration costs is roughly $200 million. The storm restoration costs have been deferred and recorded as a regulatory asset on Gulf Power’s balance sheet. Under the terms of Gulf Power’s current rate agreement, beginning 60 days following the filing of a cost recovery petition with the Florida Public Service Commission and subject to a review and prudence determination of our final storm costs, Gulf Power is authorized to recover storm restoration costs on an interim basis from customers through a surcharge. Similar to FPL, Gulf Power’s Storm Protection Plan settlement agreement was also approved during the quarter. We expect that these future hardening investments will lead to a stronger and more storm-resilient grid at Gulf Power and support an even more rapid recovery from storms in the future. Similar to other parts in the country, the Florida economy continues to recover from the impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Recent economic data reflects an improvement in the Florida unemployment rate since the start of the pandemic and an increase in consumer confidence that are roughly in line with the changes to the national averages of each metric. We continue to believe that the financial strength and structural advantages which Florida entered the crisis and the continued attraction of the state to both new residents and new businesses will support a rebound as we move beyond the pandemic. We will continue to do our part to support that outcome, including pursuing our smart capital investment program and economic development efforts, which help create jobs, provide investment in local communities and further enhance our best-in-class customer value proposition. During the quarter, FPL’s average customer growth was particularly strong, increasing by nearly $80,000 from the comparable prior year quarter. FPL’s third quarter retail sales increased 2.8% year-over-year as customer growth, weather and underlying usage per customer all contributed favorably. For Gulf Power, the average number of customers increased approximately 1.1% versus the comparable prior year quarter. Gulf Power’s third quarter retail sales declined 6.7% year-over-year, primarily as a result of unfavorable weather comparison relative to the particularly strong third quarter last year and a decline in underlying usage, primarily associated with Hurricane Sally. At both FPL and Gulf Power, third quarter weather-normalized retail sales were roughly in line with our expectations at the start of the year, and we do not believe that the pandemic had much of an overall impact on underlying usage. At FPL, we continue to expect the flexibility provided by our reserve amortization mechanism will offset any fluctuation in retail sales or bad debt expense and support a regulatory ROE at the upper end of the allowed band of 9.6% to 11.6% under our current rate agreement. Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported third quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $376 million or $0.76 per share and adjusted earnings of $551 million or $1.12 per share. This is an increase in adjusted earnings per share of $0.21 or approximately 23% from last year’s comparable quarter results, which have been restated to reflect the results of our NextEra Energy Transmission business, formerly reported in corporate and other. New investments attributed $0.06 per share, primarily reflecting continued growth in our contracted renewables program. The contribution from existing generation assets was flat year-over-year as the decline in wind resource and costs associated with the retirement of our Duane Arnold nuclear facility were roughly offset by increased PTC volume from our repowered wind projects as well as the lack of an unfavorable state tax item, which impacted last year’s third quarter results. Contributions from both NextEra Transmission and our customer supply and trading business increased by $0.01 year-over-year. All other impacts increased results by $0.13 per share, driven primarily by the absence of the write-off of development costs, the negatively impacted 2019 results. The Energy Resources development team continued to capitalize on what we believe is the best renewables development environment in our history during the quarter, with the team originating a record of nearly 2,200 megawatts. Since our last earnings call we have added 580 megawatts of new wind, 911 megawatts of solar, 594 megawatts of battery storage and 86 megawatts of wind repowering. The significant additions include a new 325 megawatts four-hour battery storage system. This project which is the largest standalone storage project in the world is expected to support California’s aggressive clean energy goals and help improve reliability across the regional electric grid when it comes online in 2023. We also executed 180 megawatts solar build-own-transfer agreement during the quarter, which is not included in our backlog additions. Partially offsetting this quarter’s strong origination success was the removal of several projects we had previously included in our backlog. A majority of the reductions are the result of an unfavorable ruling from the Alabama Public Service Commission related to several solar plus storage projects. We expect the customer to hold a future procurement for this generation capacity, and are hopeful that the projects may receive new contracts during that process. After accounting for these projects, removals the Energy Resources backlog had a net increase of 1,446 megawatts during the quarter. Reflective of our customer demand for low-cost wind, solar and battery storage projects that is stronger than ever. The repowering projects added this quarter include our first project for beyond 2020, and adds to the recent significant increase to our 2021 new wind and repowering backlog, which now totals roughly 2,000 megawatts. With the addition of the 2021 repowering project we are now introducing repowering expectations for 2021 and 2022 period of 200 megawatts to 700 megawatts. Continued cost and technology improvements have supported an expanding opportunity set for both new wind and repowering over time. As a result, we are beginning to evaluate incremental repowering opportunities for beyond 2022. Through the first three quarters of 2020 we have added nearly 4,800 megawatts to our renewables backlog, which now totals more than 15,000 megawatts and is the largest in our history. To reflect the current backlog and strong origination success we are raising the low end of our 2019 through 2022 development expectations to 15,500 megawatts, which is above the midpoint of our original range. And we are increasing the top end of the expectations to reflect the incremental repowering expectations that we added this quarter. Additionally, with more than 4,000 megawatts of renewables projects already in our backlog for post 2022 we are well positioned to execute on our long-term growth objectives. We continue to believe that by leveraging Energy Resources’ competitive advantages, we can further capitalize on the best renewables development environment in our history going forward. As we’ve previously discussed, we are optimistic about the potential for green hydrogen to support an emissions-free future. Consistent with our toe in the water approach to new opportunities Energy Resources has developed a pipeline of approximately 50 potential green hydrogen projects spanning the power, transportation and industrial sectors. These projects serve a variety of end uses, and similar to the strategy employed in wind, solar, battery storage and other areas, provide the opportunity to develop early learnings with relatively small investments to set the stage for much larger capital deployment as cost declines and technology improvements are realized. Over the next several quarters we expect to add to this pipeline, while advancing select projects as we position ourselves to continue to be a leader in the decarbonization of the energy sector. We remain excited about hydrogen’s long-term potential to further support future demand for low-cost renewables, as well as accelerate the decarbonization of transportation fuel and industrial feedstocks. Beyond renewables, we are pleased with the recent progress to resolve the outstanding permit issues required for Mountain Valley Pipeline’s construction. Among other progress since the last earnings call, MVP has received its revised biological opinion, approval of the project’s nationwide 12 permit by the Army Corps of Engineers and a recent order by FERC authorizing forward construction to resume along the majority of the project route. Following receipt of this approval, MVP resumed construction work across West Virginia and Virginia. Despite the recent progress we were disappointed with the Fourth Circuit Court’s decisions to administratively stay MVP’s nationwide 12 permit. We disagree with the court’s decision and continue to work with our partners to move the project forward. Depending on the outcome of these issues, we continue to target an in-service date of the pipeline for during 2021. Consistent with our focus on growing our rate-regulated and long-term contracted business operations, during the third quarter NextEra Energy Transmission announced an agreement to acquire Grid Lines, which owns three FERC-regulated transmission utilities spanning six states. Subject to regulatory approvals, the approximately $660 million acquisition, including the assumption of debt is expected to close in 2021, and to be immediately accretive to earnings. The proposed acquisition has strong expansion potential and attractive markets with significant expected renewables growth, and furthers our goal of growing America’s leading competitive transmission company. Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the third quarter of 2020 GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $1.229 billion or $2.50 share. NextEra Energy’s 2020 third quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $1.311 billion and $2.66 per share respectively. Adjusted earnings from Corporate and Other segment declined $0.10 year-over-year, primarily due to other corporate expenses, which includes interest. During the quarter NextEra Energy issued $2 billion of equity units as we continue to focus on opportunistic and prudent capital management to enhance the strength of our balance sheet. The equity units will convert to common equity in 2023. And the proceeds are expected to be primarily used to redeem a portion of NextEra Energy’s outstanding hybrid securities and to finance the acquisition of GridLiance and NextEra Energy’s continued renewables expansion. In addition to the redemption of hybrid securities in the fourth quarter, we are also considering several other potential refinancing activities to take advantage of the low interest rate environment. In total, these initiatives could generate negative adjusted EPS impacts of roughly $0.20 in the fourth quarter before translating to favorable net income contributions in future years and an overall improvement in net present value for our shareholders. Consistent with our efforts to position NextEra Energy well for long-term growth and take advantage of the low interest rate environment, during the quarter, we entered into $2 billion in forward starting interest rate swaps to further support future debt issuances. Finally, in July, as part of its 2020 annual review, Moody’s reduced NextEra Energy’s CFO pre-working capital-to-debt downgrade threshold from 18% to 17%. The favorable adjustment was based on recognition of NextEra Energy’s leading position in the utility and renewable energy sectors and stable cash flow generation profile. As we announced last month, based on the ongoing strength of the renewables development environment and continued execution across all of our businesses, we increased NextEra Energy’s financial expectations for 2021 and 2022, and extended our long-term growth outlook to 2023. For 2021, NextEra Energy’s adjusted EPS expectation ranges increased by $0.20, and we now expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $9.60 to $10.15. For 2022 and 2023, we expect to grow 6% to 8% off of the expected increased 2021 adjusted earnings per share. The increased adjusted earnings expectations are supported by what we believe is the most attractive organic investment opportunity set in our industry, largely as a result of the significant renewables investment opportunities that we expect to capitalize on, we now expect our total capital expenditures from 2019 to 2022, to total roughly $60 billion, an increase from the $50 billion to $55 billion range we introduced at the Investor Conference last year. During the quarter, the Board of NextEra Energy approved a four-for-one common stock split, which is intended to make stock ownership more accessible to a broader base of investors. Trading will begin on a stock split adjusted basis on October 27. And our fourth quarter and full year 2020 financial results will reflect the post split share count. As a result of the stock split NextEra Energy updated its adjusted EPS ranges to reflect the increase in its – in outstanding shares. In 2020, the company now expects adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.18 to $2.30. The adjusted EPS ranges for 2021 and beyond are included on the accompanying slide. from 2018 to 2023, we expect that operating cash flow will grow roughly in line with our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. We also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at roughly 10% per year through at least 2022 off of the 2020 base. As always, our expectations assume normal weather and operating conditions. In summary, despite the challenges created by COVID-19 pandemic, NextEra Energy has continued to deliver terrific operational and financial results through the first three quarters of 2020. Based on the resiliency of our underlying businesses and our strong growth prospects, we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted earnings per share expectations ranges in 2020, 2021, 2022 and now 2023, while at the same time, maintaining our strong credit ratings. We remain intensely focused on execution, and believe NextEra Energy remains well positioned to drive shareholder value in the coming years. Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners. The NextEra Energy Partners portfolio performed well and delivered financial results in line with our expectations. Adjusted EBITDA was down slightly compared to the third quarter of 2019 and cash available for distribution increased 10% versus the prior year comparable quarter. On a year-to-date basis, adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution have increased by 16% and 50% respectively, versus 2019. Yesterday, the NextEra Energy Partners board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.595 per common unit, or $2.38 per common unit on an annualized basis, continuing our track record of growing distributions at the top end of our 12% to 15% per year growth range. During September, NextEra Energy Partners completed the successful conversion of approximately $300 million of convertible debt into roughly 5.7 million common units. This financing, combined with a related capped call, that NextEra Energy Partners entered into at the time of the debt issuance, generated significant value for LP unitholders. Following receipt of the capped call settlement, the debt had roughly $0 three-year cumulative cash cost. Relative to issuing equity at the time of the financing, 25% fewer units were issued. And NextEra Energy Partners generated approximately $50 million in cumulative cash savings. The convertible debt financing highlights the value of NextEra Energy Partners, utilizing low-cost financing products to support growth and efficiently issue equity over time. Overall, we are pleased with the year-to-date execution at NextEra Energy Partners and are well positioned to meet our 2020 and longer-term expectations. Now, let’s look at the detailed results. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $312 million, a decline of approximately 1% year-over-year. Cash available for distribution was $162 million, up approximately 10% from the prior-year comparable quarter. new projects added $24 million of adjusted EBITDA and $16 million of cash available for distribution. Adjusted EBITDA from the existing assets declined year-over-year as lower wind resource was partially offset by growth at the Texas pipelines as a result of the expansion project going into service. Wind resource was 96% of long-term average versus a particularly strong 107% in the third quarter of 2019. cash available for distribution from existing projects benefited from a reduction in debt service payments, primarily as a result of the retirement of outstanding notes at our Genesis project and receipt of higher year-over-year PAYGO payments. The reduction in project level debt service was partially offset by higher corporate level interest expense. As a reminder, these results include the impact of IDR fees, which we treat as an operating expense. The additional details are shown on the accompanying slide. We are pleased to announce that NextEra Energy Partners has successfully completed its first two organic growth investments ahead of schedule and on budget. The repowering of the 175 megawatt Northern Colorado wind project was recently placed into service. The repowering provides multiple benefits to NextEra Energy Partners, including increased production, an uplift in project cash flow, a longer asset life and lower O&M costs. The remaining 100 megawatts of wind repowering, remains on track to be in service later this year. Additionally, during the quarter, the backup compression capacity on the Texas pipelines also reached commercial operation. The expansion opportunity is supported by a long-term contract and is expected to deliver attractive returns to LP unitholders. The ability to complete these projects as planned, despite the challenges created by the pandemic is a testament to the best-in-class engineering and construction team that NextEra Energy partners is able to leverage to execute its organic investments. We continue to expect to execute on additional attractive organic growth opportunities as the NextEra Energy Partners portfolio further expands. Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners’ expectations, which remain unchanged. NextEra Energy Partners continues to expect December 31, 2020 run rate for adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of $1.225 billion to $1.4 billion, and cash available for distribution to be in a range of $560 million to $640 million, reflecting calendar year 2021 expectations for the portfolio at year-end 2020. As a reminder, our expectations include the impact of anticipated IDR fees, as we treat these as an operating expense. NextEra Energy Partners is also considering several potential refinancing activities to take advantage of the low interest rate environment. If pursued, these initiatives could generate costs in the fourth quarter, before translating to favorable cash available for distribution contributions in future years and an overall improvement in net present value for our unitholders. From a base of NextEra Energy Partners’ fourth quarter 2019 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $2.14, we continue to see 12% to 15% per year growth in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2024. We expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2020 distribution that is payable on February 2021, to be in a range of $2.40 to $2.46 per common unit. We continue to expect to achieve NextEra Energy Partners’ 2020 distribution growth objectives, while maintaining a trailing 12-month payout ratio of approximately 70% highlighting the significant flexibility we believe NextEra Energy Partners has going forward. as we previously discussed, while we continue to be opportunistic, NextEra Energy Partners’ favorable position should give it flexibility to achieve its long-term distribution growth objectives, without the need to make any acquisitions until 2022. As always, our expectations assume normal weather and operating conditions. We are pleased with a strong year-to-date performance in NextEra Energy Partners and continue to believe it offers a compelling investor value proposition going forward. with significant expected long-term renewables growth combined with the strength of NextEra Energy Partners existing portfolio and continued access to low-cost sources of capital, we believe NextEra Energy Partners is uniquely positioned to take advantage of the disruptive factors reshaping the energy industry. NextEra Energy Partners continues to maintain flexibility to grow in three ways; through our great organic growth, third-party acquisitions or through acquisition from NextEra Energy resources, unparalleled portfolio of renewables projects that now totals roughly 28 gigawatts, including signed backlog. These factors provide us with as much confidence in NextEra Energy Partners’ long-term future as we have ever had. We look forward to delivering on that potential in the coming years. In summary, we continue to believe that both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners have some of the best opportunity sets and execution track records in the industry and we remain as enthusiastic as ever about our future prospects. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we will open up the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Steve Fleishman: Hello. Thank you. I guess, two questions; first of all, the – does the backlog increase that you announced today include the NiSource NIPSCO projects that were just announced this morning or would those be additive?
John Ketchum: Steve, this is John Ketchum. Yes, it does include the NiSource projects.
Steve Fleishman: Okay. And then second question would just be this will probably be the last time we hear from you before the election results. So just maybe, one more time. Could you just talk about in the event that Biden wins the election, thoughts on what that could mean for renewables opportunity? And also thoughts on how NextEra is positioned for any tax reform changes. Thanks.
Rebecca Kujawa: Thanks, Steve. As you well know and kind of consistent with our history, we focus on analyzing a variety of impacts and one of our key focus for going into the election is to ensure that we’re well positioned to be successful regardless of the outcome. And looking back in the last couple of years, obviously, we’ve done quite well across all of our businesses in the environment that we’ve been in. So, should Trump win a second term, we would expect to continue our strong momentum and continued focus on our strategies and execution on them. If Biden is the new President, he has clearly made clear across this platform, across the Democratic platform that they had strong support for renewables. To date, their plan is more focused on broad goals as opposed to specific plans for how they would get there, but we could easily see, whether it’s extension of incentives, focus on storage, potentially focus on hydrogen, et cetera, to further accelerate the expansion of renewables across the U.S. beyond the already strong demand that we’re seeing, that’s clearly based on the economic value of renewables relative to the alternatives. As it relates to tax reform, obviously, that’s part of some of the things that Biden has been talking about. It certainly could be on the agenda. I think there’s a question as to whether or not it would be one of the first things that a new administration would want to focus on, particularly as we will likely find ourselves still in recovery mode from the pandemic and we will evaluate, as there’s – if there are more details and as there are more details, we’ll evaluate the overall impacts. If you look at the prior tax reform as an example, clearly, a change in the tax rate, an increase in the tax rate, as Biden has talked about, would have some negative adjusted earnings impacts, positive cash impacts, all else being equal. But we need to think about, one, the details of any policies that they put forward; but two, together with the other things that would come along with the new Biden administration, including the strong demand for renewables that we would expect. So more to come as we learn more and, obviously, the results from the actual election unfold.
Steve Fleishman: Great. Thank you.
Rebecca Kujawa: Thanks, Steve.
Operator: Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Good morning to you. Thanks for the time. Appreciate it. If I can follow-up on a couple of things here. First, transmission, you guys did this interesting announcement in the quarter. How does that enable a further expansion of potentially larger-scale projects? And how does that complement essentially larger-scale renewable ambitions you might have across the core Midwest territories that they serve today?
Rebecca Kujawa: Yes, Julien. thanks for the question. We are thrilled with the acquisition, of course, subject to approvals of GridLiance, and it is the three different transmission companies across six states, where their existing assets are located. First, there are investment opportunities in those existing investments that we have – that we would have in GridLiance. But it also positions us to have a seat at the table in these regional ISOs as they contemplate new transmission projects. And obviously, GridLiance would seek to compete effectively for those opportunities. The comment around renewables is that as we think about a broad and substantial expansion of renewables across the U.S., it becomes important and increasingly so over time, to continue to invest in the transmission grid across the U.S. So, we want to be a part of that solution and capitalize on those investment opportunities via our competitive transmission business, but also, we’ll depend on that in order to realize the significant expansion of renewables over time. So, it’s both an enabler and an investment opportunity from our perspective.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Thank you. Perhaps, if I can pivot over to the more strategic side of the equation here and perhaps I’ll frame it this way. So, you all have recently received greater latitude when it comes to your debt metrics on an FFO to debt basis from the agencies. Can you talk about how you might receive yet further latitude as you think about the percent regulated the business needs to get to, to unlock yet for lower metrics, if that makes sense? And perhaps in tandem with that, might you espouse your latest thought process on strategic thinking from here beyond, perhaps some of the comments you previously provided to the extent relevant.
Rebecca Kujawa: Yes, of course. So, a strong balance sheet is incredibly important to us. And one of the things that we spend a lot of time talking with the agencies about is how strong a cash flow generation profile all of the businesses have, how diverse in a variety of metrics, including geography, technology, customers, et cetera, and how that profile compares very favorably to other peers in the industry and their own respective cash profiles. So, we did realize the improvement in downgrade thresholds, specifically at Moody’s this period that 18% to 17% downgrade threshold improvement and we’ll continue discussing with the agencies about the high-quality characteristics of our cash flows and seek improvements in additional flexibility as appropriate. There is the opportunity to have extensive dialogues with the agencies around potential regulated M&A. So any time, we do contemplate transactions we have those conversations to evaluate whether or not the profile of the cash flow generation changes such that it would move those metrics. And as we have those dialogues and have those conversations with respect to potential M&A, we factor those in to any deal transaction economics. It remains incredibly important to us to be able to maintain consistency with our objectives around M&A, which is that they’re value accretive from an earnings perspective. They also are in strong regulatory environments and create opportunities for us to invest capital. But being accretive is incredibly important to us. As you know, when we think about metrics, there are quite a number of ways to think about the balance of our business between the competitive generation business and regulated. And one of the key ways that we continue to maintain that balance is through capital recycling. And that’s one of the reasons why NextEra Energy finds value in its long-term relationship with NextEra Energy Partners, is the clear ability to recycle capital in a very efficient way with NextEra Energy Partners.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. But there’s no specific percent regulated that you want to achieve to get that number down to 16% or 15%, right?
Rebecca Kujawa: No. We’re not prescriptive about a specific balance. We think about a variety of factors when we think about what’s the optimal balance of our business and there’s not one answer at a given point in time. And certainly, that can be influenced over time as things change and our perspective and the agency’s perspective changes.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. Thank you, all. Best of luck.
Rebecca Kujawa: Thank, Julien.
Operator: Our next question comes from Shar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.
Shar Pourreza: Hi, good morning, guys.
Rebecca Kujawa: Good morning.
Shar Pourreza: Just a quick follow-up on Julien’s question. And it’s really bent on sort of that mix. Obviously, FPL and Gulf are posting very solid regulatory capital deployment, but the NEER development platform keeps signing contracts. And as you guys sort of highlighted that the backlog is now larger than the existing portfolio. So, curious on how we should sort of think about the growth trajectory of NEER as we’re sort of thinking about a mix. I mean, is 70%/30%, Rebecca, no longer relevant on what you sort of target there? Have you sort of sanitized the additional growth opportunities with NEER with the rating agencies? And then how do you sort of stay within a potential mix? Obviously, recycling capital into NEP is an option, but that has a lot of constraints and limits. Slowing down NEER likely isn’t an option. So really is the path of least resistance, more regulated acquisitions. So maybe, if you could just drill down a little bit further into the prior question?
Rebecca Kujawa: Thanks, Shar. And then I certainly appreciate the premise of the question, which is, we have terrific organic growth prospects at both the regulated utilities and in the competitive energy business. One of the things that we think is really important from the competitive side of the business is so long as we can find projects that are attractive, that have attractive returns. We don’t want our teams to be capital constrained because we believe that these are very strong value-accretive project investment opportunities for our shareholders. So, we set them off and hope that they can find all of the best projects and that we can secure the wins and build those projects. As you know, a significant amount of the value creation of developing renewables projects and owning and operating them long-term is in that development process, constructing them and beginning and putting them into operations. So, if we can continue to do that with value-accretive projects, and to the extent that we want to manage a balance of the mix of business across the different companies. We will take advantage of that capital recycling as one of the best ways and most value-accretive ways for NextEra Energy shareholders to recycle capital either to NextEra Energy Partners or potentially even to other third parties depending on market characteristics at the time. So, I think we’ve got a lot of levers. And again, most importantly, in a terrific position of win-win of having a lot of places to place our capital and, obviously, we’re pleased with raising our capital investment ranges for the four-year period.
Shar Pourreza: So just a follow-up. So that 70%/30% regulated non-utility mix, should we sort of just move away from that sort of target that we’ve discussed in the past?
Rebecca Kujawa: Shar, I think the key takeaway is there’s not a specific number that is the right number. And we’ll be – we think about it in a variety of different ways over time. And there are a variety of levers that we can utilize to maintain a balance, but we’re not prescriptive on a specific number that it needs to be.
Shar Pourreza: Got it. Got it. And then just on the battery side, you obviously added 594 megawatts, which includes a single 325, four-hour project. Can you sort of just maybe talk about the economics of storage you’re seeing, especially with the four hours project? Just maybe from an LCOE perspective, and with the current backlog of storage opportunities, is four hours of storage sort of that peak capability? Or are you seeing some longer storage opportunities?
Rebecca Kujawa: Well, let me take that last part first. I don’t know that there’s a constraint or a peak capability of storage. There are clearly a variety of storage solutions that could make sense in a given application. What our energy resources team is largely focused on is providing solutions that our customers want to buy, that solve our customers’ needs. And most recently, four-hour storage has been very attractive and particularly interesting to our customers. So, we have sold quite a number of four-hour storage projects. From a return standpoint, these storage facilities are often sold together with other renewables projects, specifically other solar projects, and we found the returns to be very attractive, comparable to solar and wind project returns on an overall basis.
John Ketchum: Yes. And Shar, this is John Ketchum. I have a couple of things that I would add to that are: One, remember, there are three ways that we really look to grow the storage business. One is pairing it with solar. The second are trifecta opportunities that we’ve advertised in the past that we’ve been successful executing on, combining storage with wind and with solar. If we were able to get – ever to get a stand-alone storage ITC, obviously, that would help what is the largest wind portfolio in North America. And then the stand-alone opportunities along the lines of what we’re able to advertise today. So, when you combine those three potential opportunity sets, we have a significant growth opportunity in storage. You see that in our 2021 CapEx plan, that is over $1 billion in storage. Nobody has the existing fleet that we have. And so the opportunity to pair storage at existing solar facilities, existing wind facilities and then look for stand-alone opportunities, I think, puts us in a different class, just based on the existing operating fleet that we have. And then as you think about batteries going forward, four-hour duration may make sense in certain markets, two hours in others. But in two to three years, we could be moving to solid-state batteries, which could also provide longer duration, more efficient at a reduced cost. And then hydrogen certainly is a long-term alternative. We mentioned the 50 pilot projects today in electricity, in transportation and industrial applications. So, we see hydrogen as really a long-term solution, particularly if we end up in 100% decarbonized energy policy by 2035, where hydrogen could really be the solution for that last 10% to 15% where it gets very expensive to do with batteries, much cheaper and more manageable to do with hydrogen.
Shar Pourreza: Terrific guys. Thank you very much.
Rebecca Kujawa: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Michael Lapides: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my questions. On the renewable front, it seems that after years of not really doing a lot, that pretty much every regulated investor-owned utility has its own renewable growth strategy and rate base. Can you talk about – now the broader market has massive tailwinds? But can you talk about how that move by the regulated IOUs is impacting the competitive dynamic for people developing, especially all given your scale, renewables on the non-regulated side of the business. Like how does that just kind of flow-through or impact the market dynamic?
Rebecca Kujawa: Thanks, Michael. We appreciate the question. Well, let me highlight first and at the risk of sounding a little too flip. We now have a backlog of over 15,000 gigawatts, and we do get a lot of questions about whether or not we’re concerned about the competitive dynamic, but the team is doing pretty well in this dynamic. And keep in mind that we’ve got customer base that’s investor-owned utilities, munis and co-ops and C&I customers. And the dynamics of wanting to build and rate base really are predominantly focused on the investor-owned utility side. And there are opportunities even within investor-owned utilities to compete effectively for the business and partner with them in many cases to create win-win opportunities for them to get the best built projects for their customers, own some of it in rate base, enable us to operate it in some cases, enable us to power purchase agreement – enter into those power purchase agreements and sell it to them over time. And then, of course, we continue to have strong opportunities to sell under contract to the munis and co-ops and C&I customers. So the outlook is very bright. Our team is doing a terrific job executing, and we’re looking forward to continuing to deliver against those growth opportunities.
John Ketchum: Yes. And just, Michael, picking up on a couple of the comments that Rebecca made. With IOUs, let’s just take a look at what happened with NIPSCO this quarter. If you add on the 400 megawatts of wind that we announced last year, we’re now at 2-gigawatts with just one customer, one investor-owned utility in Indiana, in NIPSCO. So, we still see significant opportunities for investor-owned utility renewable buildout, being able to bring low-cost solutions that combine not only traditional renewables, but with storage applications and then obviously around hydrogen. Munis and co-ops have always been a core part of the business. And then C&I, as Rebecca mentioned at the end, the C&I market is really accelerating. And as ESG has really come into the fold, a lot of the investor pressure that formally nontraditional buyers of renewables are facing from their investor base has really expanded the opportunity set for us to sell many different products to those potential customers. And one of the things that we’re seeing in the decarbonized U.S. economy is not only the chance to sell renewables, but also to play to our others ranks. So a lot of adjacencies, a lot of adjacencies around clean energy, where we are the natural fit to be a leader in some of those specific markets. And those are some of the things that we are continuing to look at and spending a lot of time as a senior team focusing on.
Michael Lapides: Got it. And if you don’t mind a follow-up on the regulated side. In the event sometime over the next couple of years, there are higher corporate income tax rates and we’ll see, obviously, policy changes and is fluid. How do you think about what that means for the customer, given the cost of service would obviously have to reflect the higher tax rate? But also the excess accumulated deferred federal income taxes that currently is being refunded by many utilities around the country, part of that would actually potentially, I think, reverse. So it would kind of put on the backs of the customer a decent bit of a rate increase and a little vary by jurisdiction and by utility. How does that impact the dynamic over a multiyear period? Yes, it raises cash flow, but it could also raise the customer bill. And what do you think the opportunity set is for NextEra in terms of either offsetting that impact? Or even improving your competitive position at the utility level relative to some of your peers?
Jim Robo: Hey Michael it’s Jim. Let me take that because we’ve been doing a lot of thinking around, obviously, different scenarios around, obviously, different scenarios around what happens with taxes depending on what happens with the federal elections. Remember, what happened in 2017 around tax reform is that the industry very effectively, I think, came together, and they were really two industries that were carved out for different treatment in the 2017 tax reform scenario. One was real estate, and I’ll let you speculate as to why real estate might have gotten singled out. And the other was the utility sector and the utility sector, I think, was very effective in laying out what the impacts to customers and to balance sheets were around tax reform. I think to the extent that there is any tax discussion next year. Let’s assume for a minute that Biden wins, I think it’s very – I think it’s – we’re obviously in a scenario planning around both outcomes because I think you can’t really handicap it one way or another right now. The best thinking that we’ve had around this is that in the middle of a pandemic it’s probably not the time to have a tax increase period. And so in terms of the timing around tax reform, I’d be surprised if it was next year, honestly, even in a Biden administration. Who knows, right? I mean that’s a bit of speculation on my part. But the other thing I think we would be very effective as an industry being able to do is to lay out how any tax increase on utilities is really simply a tax increase on all customers and non- corporations but on everyday Americans. And I think that message will resonate in Washington. And so that’s a message that we, as an industry, haven’t been able to lay out yet, obviously, because it’s premature to do so. So I think a lot of the angst around tax reform, one way or another, is I think a little premature right now. And obviously, we’ll see what happens in the election. But then if Biden does win, then there’s going to be, where does it stand up in the list of policy priorities for the newer administration if there should be one.
Michael Lapides: Got it. Thank you, Jim. Much appreciated.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Weinstein of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Michael Weinstein: Hi, guys. A couple of questions on the possibility of higher taxes on the other side of it, wondering if that would potentially reduce your need to use tax equity for projects going forward. And also, I understand as the largest player out there, you guys don’t really ever have a problem attracting tax equity investors. But can you just comment on the status of the tax equity market in general right now? I guess, it’s pretty tight for some of the smaller players. Is that something that could improve under a Democratic administration if the tax rates go up and tax credits are extended, et cetera?
Rebecca Kujawa: Sure. Let me start with this year first. From a tax equity market standpoint, that was one of the things that we and everybody else in the industry, and of course, the tax equity providers were thinking about in the early stages of the pandemic. We have secured all of our tax equity commitments for this year and have already started the dialogues with tax equity partners about our pipeline of projects for next year. And we feel confident about our ability to secure tax equity. I do think as you go out a year into 2021 and maybe into 2022, it’s certainly possible that the tax equity providers are going to have more limited capacity. And that may affect others further down the chain a little bit smaller or a lot smaller than we are and could be an issue. As it relates to tax reform, it’s – without knowing the details of it and the kind of having more of the specifics, it’s hard to answer the question of whether or not the needle has moved enough to not need tax equity. It also somewhat presumes that there’s an extension of incentives because, obviously, if the incentives phase out like they are currently expected to, there’s a less need for tax equity over time. And that’s actually one of the things that we’ve highlighted in terms of our future power purchase agreement prices, is optimization around financing, so seeking lower cost source of financing other than tax equity would be a positive. So I think there’s pluses and minuses, puts and takes. What I do feel very comfortable with is the outlook and demand for renewables is really strong, and we’ve continued to realize attractive returns, and we’re excited about keeping – continuing to capitalize on these opportunities.
Michael Weinstein: Great. Great. And also on the wind repowerings, is there – what’s the primary consideration that you’re looking at to increase those numbers as you look at 2021, 2022 and beyond?
Rebecca Kujawa: Yes. I think the key focus there is really the economics of the repowering projects and ensuring that they are attractive returns and meet the requirements from a tax perspective and, obviously, are also something that our customers are interested in. So, we’ve continued those dialogues over time. And as we’ve gotten closer to the time frames in which we would do these repowerings, obviously, the rubber starts to hit the road, and we’ve been able to start to secure some of those and have increased visibility to those incremental investment opportunities, obviously, in that range that we discussed today.
Michael Weinstein: Right. Would an extension of tax credits really allow you to really increase that or increase the opportunities anyway?
Rebecca Kujawa: It’s certainly possible that it could. Again, a little bit subject to the details of what an extension of incentives looks like, and all the other factors that go into whether or not a project is attractive, but absolutely.
Michael Weinstein: One last question. On FERC 2222, it improves the ability of residential solar to sell into grid services. And I’m just wondering, if the value – that value that comes from FERC 2222 makes –changes your mind at all about residential solar, is it possible investment opportunity for next year?
Rebecca Kujawa: We’ve looked at distributed generation investments. Obviously, we have a very strong business on the – more of the commercial and industrial side. We’ve looked at residential over time. But one of the key factors for us is that we’re a significant sized company, and we like to deploy a significant amount of capital, and inevitably, these are much smaller investment opportunities. But we do look at the business over a long period of time. And obviously, we’ll enter it where we think it makes sense. But we’re really focused on kind of a little bit larger scale investment opportunities for the most part.
Michael Weinstein: Okay. Thank you very much.
Rebecca Kujawa: Thank you.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. The conference has now also concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation and you may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-07-24 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the NextEra Energy Inc. and NextEra Energy Partners Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note today's event is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference call over to Matt Roskot, Director of Investor Relations. Sir please go ahead.
Matt Roskot: Thank you, Jamie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our Second Quarter 2020 Combined Earnings Conference Call for NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. With me this morning are Jim Robo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; Rebecca Kujawa, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; John Ketchum, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources; and Mark Hickson, Executive Vice President of NextEra Energy, all of whom are also officers of NextEra Energy Partners, as well as Eric Silagy, President and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light Company. Rebecca will provide an overview of our results, and our executive team will then be available to answer your questions. We will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today’s earnings news release, in the comments made during this conference call, in the Risk Factors section of the accompanying presentation, or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found on our websites, nexteraenergy.com and nexteraenergypartners.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. Today’s presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today’s presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of historical non-GAAP measures to the closest GAAP financial measure. With that, I will turn the call over to Rebecca.
Rebecca Kujawa: Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy delivered strong second quarter results and continued to perform well both financially and operationally, while managing the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of our core goal of safely delivering affordable and reliable power to our customers, we continue to operate under our pandemic plan that we activated last quarter. Despite the challenges created by the pandemic, NextEra Energy's second quarter adjusted earnings per share increased by more than 11% versus the prior year comparable quarter and we are well-positioned to meet our overall objectives for the year. FPL increased earnings per share by $0.15 year-over-year and its strong execution continues across the board. During the quarter, FPL set a new system peak load of more than 24,500 megawatts. FPL's transmission and distribution systems continue to operate in line with our high reliability standards and our highly efficient generating facilities remain available to serve our customers. FPL's continued strong execution is a result of the smart capital investments that we have made over the past several decades to enhance our customer value proposition of low bills, high reliability, outstanding customer service and clean energy solutions. Consistent with enhancing its best-in-class customer value proposition, last month FPL announced plans to retire share for its last remaining coal unit. Together with our joint interest owner JEA and subject to certain approvals from the Florida Public Service Commission, FPL intends to retire the 847 megawatt coal fired plant in early 2022. The retirement of Scherer 4 is projected to generate hundreds of millions of dollars in savings for FPL customers and prevent roughly four million tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually from this unit. Scherer 4's retirement is the final step of the coal phase out strategy that FPL launched in 2015 and that will complete the closure of approximately 2,700 megawatts of coal capacity, including the highest greenhouse emitting gas power plants in Florida. These transactions, which will make FPL one of the first utilities to eliminate all of the coal from its generation portfolio demonstrate FPL's continued commitment and position as a clean energy leader. We remain proud of our environmental track record, particularly the CO2 emissions reductions that we have delivered throughout Florida and across the country, and we continue to remain focused on building a sustainable energy era that is both clean and affordable. Gulf Power also had a strong quarter of execution. The focus on operational cost effectiveness at Gulf continues to progress well with year-to-date O&M costs, excluding specific COVID-19-related expenses declining by nearly 10% versus the prior year comparable period and by approximately 25% relative to 2018. Gulf Power also delivered further improvements in service reliability and continued its significant improvement in employee safely -- safety with no OSHA recordables year-to-date through the end of June. We remain committed to delivering on the objectives that we've previously outlined at Gulf Power and continue to expect to generate significant customer and shareholder value over the coming years. During the quarter, we completed our annual storm drills for FPL and Gulf Power to prepare for the unprecedented situation of restoring power after a hurricane in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. We spent two weeks drilling and challenging our teams to find ways to efficiently restore service to our customers without sacrificing safety. The drill has provided a number of lessons including how to leverage technology to quickly and safely screen personnel at various staging sites to help offset some of the challenges that will inevitably occur when performing storm restoration in the midst of a pandemic. While we hope that our service territories will avoid the impacts of hurricanes this year, consistent with our culture that is focused on preparedness and execution, we continue to do everything we can to ensure that we will be there for our customers when they need us most. At Energy Resources, adjusted EPS increased by $0.13 year-over-year. The Energy Resources team continued to capitalize on the terrific market opportunity for low-cost renewables adding 1,730 megawatts to our backlog since the last earnings call. This continued origination success through the ongoing pandemic is a testament to the Energy Resources' significant competitive advantages including our best-in-class renewables development skills. Our engineering and construction team also continues to execute commissioning roughly 650 megawatts during the quarter and keeping the remaining approximately 4,400 megawatts of wind and solar projects that we expect to complete this year on track despite the significant supply chain challenges that are occurring both globally and locally. While we are monitoring the situation closely, we continue to expect that all of our planned 2020 renewables projects will achieve their in-service dates this year. In response to increased investor focus on environmental, social and governance issues or ESG next week we expect to publish NextEra Energy's updated ESG report, which includes reporting under the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board or SASB disclosures. Our company has been focused on all of the elements of ESG for more than 25 years. NextEra Energy's approach to governance and risk oversight combined with the way that we treat our people, our customers, our communities and the environment are proof that a company can be both sustainable and financially successful at the same time. The new report highlights this alignment of our corporate strategy with the key tenets of ESG includes a robust discussion of risk oversight and incorporates new disclosures such as diversity and inclusion metrics. Diversity and inclusion matter deeply to us as a company both because we believe they are the right thing to do, but also because diverse and inclusive teams to deliver better business results for the diverse communities that we serve. Our commitment to having a diverse workforce and inclusive culture is not new and our diversity metrics are better than many of the companies in our industry. However, consistent with our focus on continuous improvement, we are not satisfied and we'll continue our efforts to build an even more diverse and inclusive team going forward. Overall, we're pleased with the progress we've made in NextEra Energy so far in 2020. Headed into the second half of the year, we believe we are well positioned to achieve the full year expectations that we have previously discussed, even when accounting for a reasonable range of impacts and outcomes that may result from the current pandemic. Now let's turn to the detailed results beginning with FPL. For the second quarter of 2020, FPL reported net income of $749 million or $1.52 per share, which is an increase of $86 million and $0.15 per share respectively year-over-year. Regulatory capital employed increased by more than 10% over the same quarter last year and was the principal driver of FPL's net income growth of approximately 13%. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $1.8 billion in the second quarter and we now expect our full year capital investments to total between $6.5 billion and $6.7 billion. Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.6% for the 12 months ended June 2020, which is at the upper end of the allowed band of 9.6% to 11.6% allowed under our current rate agreement. During the quarter we utilized $7 million of reserve amortization to achieve our target regulatory ROE leaving FPL with a balance of $736 million. We continue to expect that FPL will end 2020 with a sufficient amount of surplus to continue operating under the current base rate settlement agreement during 2021. As we've previously discussed, we expect that FPL and Gulf will operate as a single larger Florida utility company which will create both operational and financial benefits for our customers. As a result in May, the company has filed an application with FERC for an approval of an internal reorganization, whereby Gulf would merge into FPL. Subject to FERC approval the companies will merge in January of 2021. However, during 2021, Gulf Power will continue to operate as a separate operating division serving its existing customers under separate retail rates. We continue to expect the companies to file a combined rate case in the first quarter of next year for new rates effective in January 2022. Turning to our development efforts, all of our major capital initiatives at FPL remain on track and on budget. During the quarter, the final 300 megawatts of solar being built under the solar base rate adjustment or SoBRA mechanism of FPL's base rate settlement agreement were placed into service. The 1,200 megawatts of cost-effective solar constructed under the SoBRA mechanism are expected to generate significant customer benefits and represent the early stages of FPL's rapid solar expansion and the next phase of its generation modernization efforts. The next six SolarTogether projects, totaling approximately 450 megawatts, remain on track to be placed in service later this year. The final 600 megawatts of the roughly 1,500 megawatt community solar program are expected to be placed in service next year. Beyond solar, construction on the highly efficient roughly 1,200 megawatt Dania Beach Clean Energy Center remains on schedule and on budget as it continues to advance towards its projected commercial operation date in 2022. Additionally, the 409 megawatt Manatee storage facility, which will be one of the world's largest battery storage plants, is on track and on budget to be complete next year. Based on our ongoing analysis of the long-term potential of low-cost renewables, we remain confident as ever that wind, solar, and battery storage will be hugely disruptive to the energy's existing generation -- the country's existing generation fleet, while reducing cost for customers and helping to achieve future CO2 emissions reductions. However, to achieve an emissions-free future, we believe that other technologies will be necessary and we are particularly excited about the long-term potential of hydrogen. Consistent with the toe in the water approach we've previously utilized with solar and battery storage, we are planning to propose a hydrogen pilot project at FPL. This approximately $65 million pilot project which subject to Florida Public Service Commission approval is expected to be in service in 2023 will utilize solar energy that would have otherwise been clipped to produce 100% green hydrogen through a roughly 20 megawatt electrolysis system. The hydrogen will be used to replace a portion of the natural gas that is consumed by one of the three gas turbines at the Okeechobee Clean Energy Center. We believe that the project is a complement to our ongoing solar and battery storage development efforts and highlights FPL's continued innovative approach to further enhance the diversity of the clean energy solutions available for its customers. We continue to evaluate other potential hydrogen opportunities across our businesses. And while our near-term investments are expected to be small in context of our overall capital program, we are excited about the technology's long-term potential which should further support future demand for low-cost renewables as well as accelerate the de-carbonization of transportation fuel and industrial feedstocks. We continue to expect that FPL's ongoing smart investment opportunities will support a compound annual growth rate in the regulatory capital employed of approximately 9% from 2018 through 2022, while further enhancing our best-in-class customer value proposition. Let me now turn to Gulf Power, which reported second quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $55 million or $0.11 per share, a decline of $0.01 per share relative to Gulf Power's adjusted earnings per share in the prior year period. This quarter results include the impact of roughly $5 million of after-tax COVID-19 related expenses, primarily reflecting the expected incremental bad debt expense as a result of the pandemic. Earlier this month, the Florida Public Service Commission approved Gulf Power's request to record costs attributable to COVID-19; including bad debt expense as a regulatory asset on its balance sheet. As a result, the costs recorded during the second quarter are expected to be reversed during the third quarter as the regulatory asset is recorded. Gulf Power's reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 10.4% for the 12 months ending June 2020. For the full year 2020, we are targeting a regulatory ROE in the upper half of the allowed band of 9.25% to 11.25%. During the quarter, Gulf Power's capital expenditures were roughly $170 million and we now expect our full year capital investments to total between $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion. All of Gulf's major smart capital investments including the North Florida Resiliency Connection and the Plant Crist coal to natural gas conversion continue to progress well. Similar to other parts of the country, the Florida economy is being impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Recent economic data reflects an increase in Florida unemployment rate and a decline in consumer confidence that are roughly in line with the changes than national averages of each metric. While it is still unclear at this point, how severely the economy will ultimately be impacted, we continue to believe that the financial strength and structural advantages with which Florida entered the crisis and the continued attraction of the state to both new residents and new businesses will support a rebound once the worst of the pandemic is behind us. We remain deeply engaged in helping Florida return from this stronger than ever. We will continue to do our part to support that outcome, including pursuing our smart capital investment program and economic development efforts, which help create jobs, provide investment in local communities and further enhance our best-in-class customer value proposition. During the quarter, FPL's average number of customers continued its recent trend of strong underlying growth, increasing by approximately $75,000 from the comparable prior year quarter. FPL's second quarter retail sales decreased by 0.8% year-over-year as customer growth and favorable weather were more than offset by a decline in underlying usage per customer. Based on our analysis, the overall effects of the pandemic on underlying usage during the second quarter were relatively muted. FPL benefits from having its retail sales being heavily weighted towards residential customers and approximately 40% of its load is cooling related and therefore important for both comfort and building maintenance. During April, when stay-at-home orders were broadly in effect, FPL's weather-normalized retail sales were down approximately 4% relative to our expectations. As the economy began reopening in early May, weather-normalized retail sales improved and were above our expectations in June. While the ultimate impacts of the pandemic on underlying usage remain unknown at this time, we continue to expect the flexibility provided by our reserve amortization mechanism to offset any fluctuation in retail sales or bad debt expense and support regulatory ROE at the upper end of the allowed band of 9.6% to 11.6% under our current rate agreement. For Gulf Power, the average number of customers increased approximately 1.3% versus the comparable prior year quarter. Gulf Power's second quarter retail sales declined by roughly 6.2% year-over-year as a result of the under -- of the unfavorable weather comparison and a decline in underlying usage per customer. Over the second quarter, Gulf Power experienced a more significant decline in underlying usage per customer than FPL, but also experienced an improvement as the economy began reopening in May and June. As a reminder, unlike FPL, Gulf Power does not have a reserve amortization mechanism under its settlement agreement to offset fluctuations in revenue or costs, so any variability would therefore have more impact to Gulf's earnings and ROE than at FPL. As a reminder, as we've often discussed, weather normalization is imprecise particularly when evaluating short periods of time. Additional details on retail sales at FPL and Gulf Power are included in the appendix of today's presentation. Let me now turn to Energy Resources which reported second quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $481 million or $0.97 per share and adjusted earnings of $531 million or $1.08 per share. This is an increase in adjusted earnings per share of $0.13 or approximately 14% from last year's comparable quarter results, which have been restated to reflect the results of our NextEra Energy transmission business formerly reported in Corporate and Other. New investments added $0.08 per share. Contributions from existing generation assets increased $0.05 per share as improved wind resource and increased PTC volume from our repower wind projects were partially offset by the refueling outage at the Seabrook nuclear facility. Second quarter fleet-wide wind resource was 99% of the long-term average versus 93% during the second quarter of 2019. Also contributing favorably was NextEra Energy transmission, where contributions increased by $0.03 versus 2019. Contributions from our gas infrastructure business including existing pipelines were flat year-over-year. These favorable contributions were partially offset by lower contributions from our customer supply and trading business, which declined $0.04 versus the particularly strong second quarter last year. All other impacts increased results by $0.01 per share. As I mentioned earlier, Energy Resources development team had another excellent quarter of origination success, adding 1,730 megawatts to our backlog. Since our last earnings call, we have added 708 megawatts of wind, 844 megawatts of solar and 178 megawatts of battery storage to our renewables backlog. We also executed a build-owned transfer agreement for a 200 megawatt solar project which is not included in our backlog additions. All of the battery storage projects will be paired with either new or existing solar projects to take advantage of the ITC and provide a more firm renewable product for our customers. The continued strong demand for battery storage projects highlights the rapid transition to the next phase of renewables development that pairs low-cost wind and solar energy with a low-cost battery storage solution. We continue to expect that by the middle of this decade without incentives, new near firm wind and new near firm solar will be cheaper than the operating costs of most existing coal and nuclear facilities and less fuel-efficient oil and gas-fired generation units, producing significant long-term renewables demand. Our current backlog now totals approximately 14,400 megawatts and is the largest we have ever had in our roughly 20-year development history. To put our backlog into context, it is larger than the current operating wind and solar portfolios of all but two other companies in the world as of year-end 2019, highlighting that NextEra Energy continues to be at the forefront of disruption that is occurring within the energy sector. Only halfway through 2020, we are pleased, we have already signed, nearly 3,500 megawatts of contracts for delivery beyond 2022, which is a reflection of the continued strong economic demand for wind, solar and battery storage. To ensure that we can take advantage of this significant demand in the coming years, we now have more than $2 billion of safe harbor wind and solar equipment, which could support as much as $40 billion of wind, solar and battery storage investments across all of our businesses from 2021 to 2024. These purchases highlight the benefits of scale and the strength of our balance sheet that we leverage as a key competitive advantage in renewables development and position us well for continued long-term growth. The safe harbor equipment also supports additional repowering opportunities, including several hundred megawatts of potential 2021 repowering projects, which we are currently evaluating. As I discussed earlier, all of the 2020 renewables projects remain on track to achieve their targeted in-service dates this year. As a result, we do not expect these projects to rely on the updated treasury start of construction guidance that was released during the quarter. Beyond renewables, we continue to make progress with Mountain Valley Pipeline and work with our project partners to resolve the outstanding permit issues required for the pipelines construction. We were pleased with the Supreme Court's ruling regarding Appalachian Trail crossing authorization authority, which resolved similar issues for MVP. We were similarly pleased that the Supreme Court partially stayed the Montana Federal Court's decision related to the nationwide 12 permit program and are working with the Army Corps of Engineers on its reissuance of the project's permit. Following comprehensive restudy by the relevant agencies, we expect issuance of MVP's revised biological opinion shortly. Assuming timely resolution of the outstanding permitting issues, we are now targeting a full in-service date for the pipeline during early 2021 and expect an overall project estimate in the range of $5.4 billion to $5.7 billion. Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the second quarter of 2020, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $1.275 billion or $2.59 per share. NextEra Energy's 2020 second quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $1.286 billion and $2.61 per share respectively. Adjusted earnings from Corporate and Other declined by $0.01 year-over-year, primarily as a result of higher interest expense. NextEra Energy also delivered strong year-to-date operating cash flow growth and for the full year 2020 expects to generate roughly $8.5 billion in operating cash flow to help support its strong financial position. NextEra Energy maintains approximately $13 billion in liquidity to support the largest capital investment program in our history. Since last quarter's call, we completed roughly $3 billion in long-term financings, including a $2.2 billion in Capital Holdings debentures. Over the course of the last few months, we repaid nearly all of the term loans that we issued during March and April and converted these commitments to bilateral revolving credit facilities. Included in these facilities is a total of more than $1 billion in 6 month storm facilities at FPL and Gulf Power, which similar to previous years we put in place to ensure sufficient liquidity in the event of a hurricane. Energy Resources also closed two tax equity financings, including its first-ever combined wind and solar portfolio financing and we expect to close on the balance of our tax equity financings as the renewable projects are placed in service later this year. Our year-to-date financing activities are evidence of the great financial partnerships we have built over time, which help provide ample liquidity and continued access to capital to support our outstanding growth prospects. NextEra Energy's financial expectations remain unchanged. We continue to expect that NextEra Energy's adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate to be in a range of 6% to 8% through 2021 off of the 2018 adjusted EPS of $7.70 plus the accretion of $0.15 and $0.20 in 2020 and 2021, respectively from the Florida acquisitions. For 2020, we continue to expect our adjusted EPS to be in the range of $8.70 to $9.2. For 2022, we expect to grow adjusted EPS in the range of 6% to 8% off of the 2021 adjusted EPS translating to a range of $10 to $10.75 per share. From 2018 to 2022, we continue to expect that operating cash flow will grow roughly in line with our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. We also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at roughly 10% per year through at least 2022 off of a 2020 base. While our expectations always assume normal weather and operating conditions as we consider a reasonable range of impacts related to the current pandemic, we continue to feel comfortable with the expectations that we have outlined. In summary, despite the challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic, all of our businesses continue to perform well and maintain their excellent prospects for growth going forward. We have a long-term track record of delivering results for our customers and shareholders and we remain intensely focused on continuing that track record. Based on the resiliency of our underlying businesses and their strong growth prospects, we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted earnings per share expectation ranges in 2020, 2021 and 2022, while at the same time maintaining our strong credit metrics. We continue to remain enthusiastic about our future and believe that NextEra Energy is well-positioned to drive long-term shareholder value over the coming years. Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners, which continued its strong start to 2020 with growth in adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution of approximately 23% and 46%, respectively from the prior year comparable quarter. On a year-to-date basis, adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution have increased by 26% and 86%, respectively versus 2019. The strong operational and financial performance that NextEra Energy -- highlights the NextEra Energy Partners remained well-positioned to continue to deliver on its outstanding growth objectives. Yesterday, the NextEra Energy Partners Board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.5775 per common unit or $2.31 per common unit on an annualized basis continuing our track record of growing distributions at the top end of our 12% to 15% per year growth range. We are pleased to see PG&E's emergence from bankruptcy earlier this month. As expected all of our existing contracts were assumed without modification. Following PG&E's emergence from bankruptcy, NextEra Energy Partners received a cash distribution of approximately, $65 million from our Desert Sunlight 250 and 300 projects, which represent current distributions and those previously withheld as a result of the bankruptcy. The release of the Desert Sunlight trap cash supplements NextEra Energy Partners' liquidity, which was approximately $650 million including cash-on-hand at the end of the second quarter. The organic growth investments at NextEra Energy Partners continue to progress well. The approximately 275 megawatts of wind repowering and the Texas pipeline expansion both remain on-track to be in service later this year. We continue to expect to execute on additional attractive growth opportunities as NextEra Energy Partners' portfolio further expands. Let me now review the detailed results for NextEra Energy Partners. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $349 million and cash available for distribution was $166 million, up 23% and 46% respectively against the prior year comparable quarter. Now that the PG&E bankruptcy has been favorably resolved and distributions from our Desert Sunlight projects have resumed, cash available for distribution includes all contributions from PG&E-related projects. New projects added $51 million in adjusted EBITDA and $36 million of cash available for distribution. Existing projects also contributed favorably to the significant year-over-year growth in adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution as resource was favorable across the portfolio. For the second quarter wind resource was 100% of the long-term average versus 94% in the prior year comparable quarter. Cash available for distribution also benefited from a reduction in project-level debt service, primarily as a result of the early debt retirement to facilitate the wind repowerings. The reduction in project-level debt service was partially offset by higher corporate level interest expense. As a reminder these results are net of IDR fees since we treat these as an operating expense. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide. Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners' expectations which remain unchanged. NextEra Energy Partners continues to expect December 31, 2020 run rate for adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of $1.225 billion to $1.4 billion and cash available for distribution in the range of $560 million to $640 million, reflecting calendar year 2021 expectations for the portfolio at the end of 2020. Now that the PG&E bankruptcy has been favorably resolved, we will no longer provide CAFD expectations including contributions -- excluding the contributions from the Desert Sunlight projects. As a reminder these expectations include the impact of anticipated IDR fees as we treat these as an operating expense. From a base of our fourth quarter 2019 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $2.14 we continue to see 12% to 15% growth per year in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2024. We expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2020 distribution that is payable in February of 2021 to be in a range of $2.40 to $2.46 per common unit. Similar to NextEra Energy, while our expectations always assume normal weather and operating conditions as we consider a reasonable range of impacts related to the current pandemic we continue to feel comfortable with our overall expectations. With the resumption of cash distributions from the Desert Sunlight projects, we now expect to achieve NextEra Energy Partners 2020 distribution growth objectives, while maintaining a trailing 12-month payout ratio of approximately 70%, highlighting the significant flexibility we believe NextEra Energy Partners has going forward. As we've previously discussed while we will continue to be opportunistic, NextEra Energy Partners' favorable positioning should give it flexibility to achieve its long-term distribution growth objectives without the need to make any acquisitions until 2022. We are pleased with NextEra Energy Partners' year-to-date performance in 2020 and believe it continues to offer a best-in-class value proposition for investors. The diversity and long-term contracted nature of NextEra Energy Partners' clean energy portfolio helps insulate it from the broader economic conditions including impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic with the flexibility to grow in three ways: acquiring assets from energy resources organically or acquiring assets from third parties. NextEra Energy partners has clear visibility into its growth going forward.  Following another strong quarter of origination, Energy Resources' portfolio of renewable projects now totals more than 27 gigawatts including the signed backlog of projects that Energy Resources plans to build in the coming years. When combined with the prospects for future renewables development, NextEra Energy Partners' long-term growth visibility remains as strong as ever. NextEra Energy Partners' cost of capital and access to capital advantages including significant demand from various low-cost private infrastructure capital provide flexibility to finance this growth over the long term. These strengths together with NextEra Energy Partners' favorable tax position and enhanced governance rights leave NextEra Energy Partners uniquely positioned to continue to deliver on its objectives going forward. In closing, we believe that the fundamental value proposition of NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners remains as robust as ever. Both companies remain resilient and well positioned to deliver on their commitments. We continue to remain enthusiastic about our future and our continued -- and are focused on delivering smart capital investments that enhance value for both customers and shareholders and expand our position as the world's leading clean energy provider. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we will open up the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Julien Smith from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.
Richard Ciciarelli: Hey, good morning. This is actually Richie here for Julien. Just had a question around the CapEx raise at FPL and Gulf. What was driving that? Is that more around undergrounding and grid hardening, or is that more on the solar side? And how should we think about the CapEx trajectory from 2021 and beyond? Is that more in line with what you disclosed at your Analyst Day, or should we expect it to be at more of these robust levels going forward?
Rebecca Kujawa: Richie good morning and thanks for the question. I think it really reflects of consistency with what we've been talking about for a long time, which is we keep finding terrific projects for our customers and investment opportunities and we're starting to put those in place. As I highlighted in the prepared remarks, we do have a consistent expectations for the growth rate between 2018 and 2022 of a 9% compound annual growth rate. So, obviously some projects move from one year to another. But at the heart of it, it is terrific investments for the benefit of our customers. As far as beyond 2022, similar to comments that we've made in the past, the growth opportunities that we see across all of our businesses, but specific at FPL and Gulf Power include the modernization efforts including the large deployment of solar over time as well as investments in grid hardening and undergrounding as highlighted by the storm protection plan that we're in the process of going through approvals and initial investments for that program. So we're super excited about the opportunities for investing, and again, stay very focused on ensuring that these are good projects for the benefit of our customers.
Richard Ciciarelli: Got it. Thanks. That's very helpful. And then just around your comments around hydrogen. I think you disclosed $65 million for that pilot project. What are you seeing there on that front? Is this more around transportation opportunities, or is this all around like a pipeline and being able to like blend with the pipes?
Rebecca Kujawa: So we're really excited about hydrogen. In particular, when we think about getting to a -- not a net zero emissions profile, but actually a zero carbon emissions profile. And for -- when we looked at this let's call it, 5 years, 10 years ago and we thought about what it would take to get to true zero emissions, we were worried that it was extraordinarily expensive for our customers. What makes us really excited about hydrogen particularly in the 2030 and beyond time frame is that that has the potential to supplement significant deployment of renewables including wind and solar technologies complemented by short and I'll call it medium-term duration batteries. But then that last amount of emissions that you would take out of the system to get down to zero could be most economically served by hydrogen. So that's what makes us excited about doing a pilot project. We're very excited about the opportunity to present that to the Florida Public Service Commission as a way to further enhance FPL's ability to innovate and deliver these long-term clean energy solutions to our customers. And as part of that, we'll learn about the technologies, and we'll see what other opportunities there are potentially for the industrial and transportation sectors with – and for us to be able to produce that – the green energy to produce the green hydrogen is a potential significant opportunity for us. We think we're at the early stages, which is kind of consistent with our toe in the water approach. We want to get some experience with it. Obviously, do a lot of research and talk to folks in the supply chain and get better equipped to deal – take advantage of these opportunities. But we're really excited about it.
Richard Ciciarelli: All right. Thanks a lot. That's all the questions I had.
Rebecca Kujawa: Thank you, Richie.
Operator: Our next question comes from Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead with your question.
Constantine Lednev: Hi. Good morning. It's actually Constantine here for Shar as well. Congratulations on a great quarter. It's – we've definitely seen some impressive numbers for the backlog additions, and kind of contract increases for the 2022 time frame. Just kind of curious on kind of your thoughts around kind of near growth trajectory and kind of contribution to the business mix. And it's kind of subsided as the conversation point from the rating agencies, but just thoughts on kind of growing contributions from near kind of versus balancing that from the regulated contributions. Kind of does it – are you thinking about bolt-on acquisitions or kind of any kind of drop-downs accelerated from near? Just some thoughts around that.
Rebecca Kujawa: Thanks, Constantine. We appreciate you dialing in this morning. We're really excited about pursuing opportunities for investment across the board. And of course, at FPL and Gulf that's focused on investments that meet – that need to create value for our customers and at Energy Resources it's return focused along with delivering things for our customers there too. So from a corporate perspective, we don't want to limit any of our businesses, when we find great investment opportunities, which again, I can't highlight enough about how excited we are about the renewables development prospects at Energy Resources. So we're not going to constrain them in any way. We will develop those opportunities that create value for shareholders. And to the extent that, we want to maintain balance over time, we've got a lot of opportunities to do that that are accretive for shareholders, including recycling of capital through NextEra Energy Partners, which is obviously a willing and excited acquirer of Energy Resources projects, but Energy Resources has the ability to recycle capital to third parties as well. So there's plenty of ways to ensure that we can create the real value-accretive opportunities, and still think about it from a corporate perspective in a variety of different ways.
Constantine Lednev: Thanks. That's very helpful. And kind of pivoting a little bit to something a little bit longer term, I guess. Can we get some of your thoughts on the November election, and kind of the Biden campaign has put out some plans and frameworks out there, the higher tax rate, clean energy support. How is NextEra positioned for kind of potential changes at the federal level?
Jim Robo: So, this is Jim. We always position our business to try to win regardless of the outcome of elections. And so we – I think, you can remember back close to four years ago now there was some turmoil around our stock, when President Trump was elected. We've managed to completely be fine under this administration in terms of being able to continue to grow our renewable business, because you know what it's all about economics, right? And the time for renewables is now and that kind of transcends politics frankly the economics and the need to – and really the need to de-carbonize not only the electric sector, but the rest of the sectors of the economy are really frankly transcend what happens in elections. And so obviously, we watch them closely. We think good clean energy policy is important and the right policy for America in the future. And we continue, I think to be positioned really well regardless of who wins in November.
Constantine Lednev: Okay. That makes sense. I’ll jump back in the queue. Thanks so much.
Rebecca Kujawa: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Weinstein from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.
Michael Weinstein: Hi, good morning, guys. On the same question, Jim, are you – what do you think is the most likely outcome from the Congress these days tax credit extensions, cash grants? Do you think a national renewable portfolio standard is a possibility? I'm just wondering of all those different alternatives, what do you think might actually occur, in the next four years?
Jim Robo: So I think, it's honestly too soon to tell, Michael. I think a lot is going to depend on what happens in the election. And is there continued split government or is there not split government that will be I think, a big driver of what policies happen. And I think all of those ideas are on the table. We've been consistent in, what we've said which is, that we think it's important to have a good and fair clean energy policy going forward. We also have said that it's -- that we think wind and renewables with batteries will be -- are very competitive once the PTCs and the ITCs phase out, in terms of competing against conventional generation. It's just honestly, really more a matter of the speed with which you want to decarbonize is what is going to ultimately drive the final I think policy choices. And so, we are -- obviously we're actively engaged in the discussions. And I think, it's premature really to say, what we think is going to happen. Because I think you have an election in four, five months. And as you all know, elections have consequences. And we'll see what happens post the election in terms of what's going to be the policy landscape going forward.
Michael Weinstein: Great. And on hydrogen, do you think -- and I noticed there's a lot of -- a lot more emphasis on renewables rather than gas turbines. And your future construction plans at FPL. And I'm just wondering if hydrogen works out, is that a method -- do you think you could actually build more -- put more gas turbines back into the plan, if hydrogen production becomes a viable economic alternative, or do you think other alternative technologies are better suited, such as fuel cells?
Rebecca Kujawa: Mike, I think from a hydrogen perspective and specific to Florida Power & Light Company, we're talking about potential hydrogen opportunities really in the 2030 and beyond timeframe. And in that intervening time we deploy a significant amount of solar technology. And then, if we're right, and if the costs come down for hydrogen, and it is the best alternative for supporting getting to a zero emissions profile, we would retrofit certain of our gas facilities to run on hydrogen or run on a portion of hydrogen. So I think for Florida Power & Light and Gulf Power, it's -- at this point and again we're talking about a long way into the future, you wouldn't necessarily need to build any new hydrogen/gas turbines in that portfolio. Because we've got a tremendously efficient fleet that's already in service and the investments we would make are really around conversion. Now, whether or not that's true elsewhere in the country, I think is -- it might be a little bit different, But we're talking about a long way down the road and a lot of things need to come together to have those types of conversations. I think it's fairly preliminary.
Michael Weinstein: Got you. And one final question. Just make a comment on M&A interest these days, what's going on with Santee Cooper, et cetera.
Jim Robo: So I think, we -- this won't be surprising. We remain interested in M&A. We think there's a lot that we can bring to the table. I continue to believe that there's not a utility in the country that we couldn't run more efficiently and better for customers. And I truly believe that. And so, we continue to look. I think, in terms of Santee Cooper, that process has been pushed to next year. And we remain very interested. And continue to be focused on trying to make that happen.
Michael Weinstein: All right, Jim could you -- what regions of the country are you focused on? I was just curious?
Jim Robo: We continue to be focused on, the Midwest and the Southeast…
Michael Weinstein: All right. Thank you very much.
Jim Robo: … plus FERC-regulated assets pretty much anywhere.
Michael Weinstein: Perfect. Okay. Thanks a lot.
Rebecca Kujawa: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Stephen Byrd from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.
Dave Arcaro: Hi. Thanks. It's Dave Arcaro on for Stephen. Thanks for taking my question. I had one quick follow-up just on the hydrogen topic. Wondering if you see a potential path for this to be an opportunity at NEER? And also in terms of business model, but do you think that you would envision being involved in owning the electrolysis function within the supply chain? And if so do you have a vision or view on what technology is ahead of others at this point?
Rebecca Kujawa: Thanks Dave. I would say at this point we're looking for opportunities across the portfolio, obviously, we talked about the pilot project at FPL today, but we are looking at other pilot type investment opportunities elsewhere in the portfolio consistent with the way that we approach solar early on and of course batteries more recently. So I think there will be opportunities over time for those type of pilot projects. Again where you think of it as actually being close to economic today are areas where there's already significant penetration of renewables, because as you well know, it's critical to find a low-cost electricity supply in order to make it economic or close to economic. And here in the U.S., the economics certainly have to factor in that today there's a very low-cost supply of natural gas, making it the imperative that you find a cheap electricity supply. It's early. Never say never on where we might find opportunities to invest in the business. But historically as you know, we've not played in the space of owning -- being a vertically integrated owner of technologies or projects. We've typically taken the best of manufactured equipment from other folks, apply our scale and our ability to construct, own and operate over the long-term effectively is where we create value. So again it's early. But at this point, I wouldn't think that we would focus on vertically integrating. It's more of applying hydrogen as a technology consistent the way that we've created value in the past.
Jim Robo: So the only thing I would add to that two things. One, is I'd be disappointed if in John's business we don't make some, kind of, pilot investment in the next year. We're looking at a variety of things, and I'd be disappointed if we don't make some, kind of, pilot investment in the next year, a very much toe in the water like we did a decade ago in the battery storage business. Secondly, clearly we're not going to backward integrate into manufacturing electrolyzers or anything like that, but I wouldn't rule out us owning them as part of an integrated system that was integrated with renewables to manufacture hydrogen. And as our view around that would be if we had a long-term contract and obviously we have access to very efficient capital, we know how to operate equipment. We're -- and so a lot of that would come to our -- I think our strategic advantages in terms of how we're able to create value for folks. So I think it's early. We are -- there's clearly an opportunity to five to 10 years from now to displace the last 10% of the carbon emissions out of the electric sector by manufacturing hydrogen with renewables. That's clear. I think there's also clearly an opportunity to make renewables to displace diesel fuel and perhaps even other types of transportation fuel going forward. And there's also I think clearly an opportunity to make green hydrogen to replace other types of hydrogen or/and other feedstocks in industrial applications. And so we're looking at all of that and we're not being -- all of that in the end comes back to a very important thing, which is this is going to drive gigawatts and gigawatts and gigawatts and gigawatts of renewable demand in this country. And so there is no one better positioned than us to take advantage of that. And we're going to be -- just like we were in battery storage, we're going to be at the vanguard. We're going to -- and we're going to -- this is a big strategic initiative for us and we're going to drive it, and it's going to be very important for this company I think not -- over the next decade. We won't make any money on it in the next five years just like we didn't make any money in batteries in the first five years. And next year we're deploying $1 billion of batteries 10 years later. And so that's the way I think about this. I think about this is help powering the long-term growth of this company into the back half of this decade and the next decade as well.
Dave Arcaro: Got it. That's really helpful. Thank you so much for those comments. I just had one other quick M&A follow-up. I was just wondering if -- is there any path for Texas to be a target of interest for you from an M&A perspective, or what would need to change there? Thanks.
Jim Robo: So we have spent a lot of time in Texas. Obviously, we own assets in Texas and so we are a great operator. And we feel like we would bring an enormous amount of the state. We own billions of dollars of assets in the state, right? And we are a great partner for the state. And so, I would never say, never. Obviously, we were extraordinarily disappointed in the Encore decision. We think it was a mistake and shortsighted, but that is what it is. And so, it's probably going to take a bit to get past that before I'm super excited about doing things in Texas from an M&A standpoint.
Dave Arcaro: Understood. Understood. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.
Michael Lapides: Hi, good morning, everybody. Thank you for taking my question. I want to turn to Florida for a second. You're supposed to file rate cases next year at both utilities. And obviously, the combination of the two will be a big fact of that. Is there any potential for being able to delay or defer the timing of the rate cases to a, see what happens from a tax perspective in D.C. from a public policy perspective, just so you don't have to go back to the regulator two or three times over a two or three year period. And b, is there any scenario where you may not even need a rate case or rate review?
Rebecca Kujawa: Good morning, Michael and we appreciate the question. As I've commented, I think even in these prepared remarks, we do continue to believe that FPL and Gulf would file for a combined rate case in early 2021 for new rates effective in 2022. As you highlighted, there's some uncertainties and certain factors that could change, but that's the reality of operating any business. You know what you know those days and you do the best you can for planning for uncertainties. And we certainly would contemplate changes that we're aware of at the time, but you've got to keep running your business. And what's most important from our perspective is continuing to have the ability to invest in Florida Power & Light and invest at Gulf Power in these great opportunities that we see for the benefit of our customers. We continue to lead the industry in O&M costs. We continue to lead the industry in reliability and customer service. And the best way to keep doing that is execute and that means occasionally having rate cases. We are excited about that prospect. We've been preparing for it for a long time. And we think we have a great story to tell and we welcome the opportunity to talk about the things that we've been doing at FPL and Gulf. So right -- for now, obviously things could change. But for now, we continue to have those plans to file in 2021 for new rates effective 2022.
Michael Lapides: Got it. And one other question just on the Florida utilities. You have been the industry leader in terms of cost management. Do you think the pace of change in O&M cost declines will stay at this level meaning the year-over-year change or decline rates, or do you think you're reaching a point where it will start to flatten out where the ability to continue to take out as much cost as you've done every year will start to slow?
Rebecca Kujawa: The surest answer to that Michael is we've got a very creative team and we've got a team that is focused on continuous improvement and not afraid of that. But let it -- let me also not underestimate what that requires and that requires the ability to identify those new technologies and take that cost out over time. So there's -- we have to work for it. And so every year, we pull together and come up with our best ideas. Do we think over the long period of time that we've exhausted every opportunity? No in part because I think technology will continue to enhance our ability to do that, but it takes time to execute those opportunities. So our discipline is there, our creativity is there, our innovation, our commitment to continuous improvement and we're going to do the best we can to create the best value for our customers.
Michael Lapides: Got it. Thank you, Rebecca. Much appreciated.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's question-and-answer session as well as today's conference call. We do thank you for joining today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.

James Robo: Thanks Matt, and good morning everyone. Before I begin, I want to take a moment to extend our deepest sympathies to all those who have been personally affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The country and the world are facing devastating impacts from the spread of the virus, and we remain resolutely focused on doing our part by continuing to deliver affordable and reliable power. Never before has it been more clear how critical electricity is to the world, and our team is laser focused on ensuring its uninterrupted delivery so first responders can help those in need, businesses can continue to operate where possible, governments can continue to function, and our customers can go about their daily lives to the greatest extent possible during these challenging times. As part of NextEra Energy’s core commitment to do the right thing, at both FPL and Gulf Power we have taken steps to help customers face the challenges that the pandemic has created. Both utilities have suspended electric disconnections during this state of emergency to ensure our customers have continued access to power, regardless of their economic circumstances. Additionally, next month the typical FPL and Gulf Power residential customers will receive a one-time bill decrease of approximately 25% and 40% respectively as an accelerated flow-back of lower fuel costs.  The NextEra Energy companies and employees have also committed more than $4 million emergency assistance funds to provide critical support to the most vulnerable members of the community. Our hope is that these steps will help customers navigate this difficult and unsettling time and support a more rapid recovery for them and the Florida economy generally. We remain deeply engaged in helping Florida return from this pandemic stronger than ever, and we’ll continue to do our part to support that outcome. It is during challenging times like these that the culture of NextEra Energy shines through, a culture focused on leadership, accountability, a passion to be the best, and a focus on flawless execution. NextEra Energy’s employees have exemplified these characteristics over the past several weeks. I am very proud of how they stepped up, once again confirming my belief that we have the best team in the industry and that our culture and our people are our most important asset. Despite their daily lives being disrupted by the ongoing effects of the pandemic, our employees focus on continuing to do their jobs and delivering essential resource for customers and our economy has been unwavering. I’d like to take a moment to thank all NextEra Energy employees for their continued focus, hard work, and execution during these challenging times. It is because of them that I’ve never been more confident in our ability to deliver on all our expectations to our customers, shareholders, and other stakeholders.  As we focus on execution, the safety of our employees and the community is always our number one priority. To ensure that our critical operations, including the grid within Florida and our generating facilities, particularly our nuclear sites continue to operate safely and remain available to serve our customers, we have instituted our pandemic plan, which was most recently updated last year and have taken aggressive measures to protect our employees.  We understand the critical role that electricity plays in the economy and the daily lives of Floridians, and FLP and Gulf Power remain steadfastly focused on meeting their commitments. As we face the challenges created by the pandemic, we are fortunate that preparedness and crisis planning are in our DNA. For nearly 70 years, we have had annual drills to prepare for disruptions to our business, and while the circumstances of this situation are unique, it is that preparation to deal with the unexpected that is allowing our company to continue to deliver for our customers through this challenging time. Over the past several months, NextEra Energy has continued to execute across the board. Our transmission and distribution systems continue to perform in line with a typical high reliability standards. The more than $5 billion that FPL has invested since 2006 to build a stronger and smarter grid allows us to leverage automation and manage the team D system remotely. That automation and its ability to limit human intervention has never been more important than today. Operations at all our generating facilities at FPL, Gulf Power and Energy Resources have been modified to protect the health and safety of our employees, and the pandemic has not caused any meaningful impacts at this time. In addition to ensuring continued safe and reliable operations at our plants, our nuclear team also delivered outstanding performance during the recent refueling outages at St. Lucie and Point Beach. In fact, the Point Beach refueling outage was one of the shortest outages in our entire nuclear fleet in the past 20 years. The ongoing outages at Turkey Point and Seabrook also continue to progress well. One of our most important core values is our commitment to excellence in all that we do. Over a long period of time, we have invested significant time and effort in developing key strategic partnerships, particularly related to our supply chain, to help support our ability to execute during challenging times like these. Over the past several months, our key strategic partners have continued to deliver, highlighting the value of deep, long-lasting relationships with best-in-class companies. These deep relationships and our position as the industry leader give us confidence that our equipment deliveries should remain on track, even if others face supply issues over the coming months. Our engineering and construction team also continues to perform exceptionally well, keeping the largest construction program in NextEra Energy’s history on schedule and on budget. NextEra Energy’s financial performance for the first quarter reflects this strong operating performance across all our businesses, with adjusted EPS increasing more than 8% year-over-year.  Let me now turn to our strategic focus, which remains unchanged. At FPL and Gulf Power, our focus has been and will continue to be on delivering an outstanding value proposition of low bills, high reliability, outstanding customer service, and clean energy solutions for our customers. The value of FPL’s smart capital investments that we’ve made over the past several decades has never been more clear. These investments, including FPL’s highly efficient generation portfolio and a stronger and smarter grid are allowing FPL to continue efficiently delivering affordable, reliable, and clean energy to our customers. While we continue to monitor the situation, our capital investment program remains on track at FPL and Gulf Power. The investments that we are making today, including one of the world’s largest solar expansions, are expected to provide meaningful customer benefits over the coming years. As we move toward the current challenges, it will be important that we continue to provide low cost reliable service to our customers to support their recovery. The flexibility provided by FPL’s reserve immunization mechanism combined with our best-in-class operational cost effectiveness help position FPL to meet its financial commitments while making smart, long-term investments during this uncertain time. At Gulf Power, we remain committed to delivering on the objectives that we have previously outlined and continue to expect to generate significant customer and shareholder value over the coming years. Similar to FPL and Gulf Power, our strategic vision at Energy Resources remains unchanged and we believe the market opportunity for low cost renewables has never been greater. In times when consumers and businesses are dealing with the challenges of economic uncertainty, we expect our customers will help ease these impacts by lowering the cost of power to their customers through new, renewable generation.  Reflecting the strong customer demand for renewables, the Energy Resources team had another terrific quarter of origination, adding approximately 1,600 megawatts to our backlog since the last earnings call, including our first 600 megawatts of wind projects for 2022 and beyond. Most of this quarter’s backlog additions were negotiated remotely while employees operated under stay-at-home orders. The ability to add nearly 1,600 megawatts despite these conditions is a testament to our strong customer relationships, pipeline, and development skills. Also included in these backlog additions are approximately 460 megawatts of battery storage projects, almost all of which will be added to existing solar sites to take advantage of the ITC and enhance the value of our existing projects for customers. With the significant recent growth in our battery storage backlog, we increasingly see storage as an important standalone business in its own right. NextEra Energy’s battery storage investments in 2021 are now expected to exceed $1 billion, which we believe would be the largest ever annual battery storage investment by any power company in the world, and have a total gigawatt hour capacity that discharges enough electricity to power the entire of Rhode Island for four hours. This highlights the rapid transition to the next phase of renewables development that pairs low-cost wind and solar energy with a low-cost battery storage solution. We continue to expect that by the middle of this decade, without incentives, new near firm wind and new near firm solar will be cheaper than the operating costs of most existing coal, nuclear and less efficient oil and gas biogeneration units. As a result, we expect that the long-term projections for wind and solar that we have previously shared will be achieved or exceeded over the coming decade, representing a tremendous growth opportunity for Energy Resources.  As we celebrate the 50th anniversary of Earth Day today, we are proud of our track record of improving the environment particularly through the CO2 reductions that we have delivered as a result of our clean energy efforts across the country. We are at the vanguard of building a sustainable energy era that is both clean and affordable, and we are driving very hard to continue to be at the forefront of disruption that is occurring within the energy sector. To capitalize on this significant growth opportunity, Energy Resources expects to extend its long track record of excellence and execution. By leveraging our strong relationships with our equipment suppliers and contractors that I’ve previously mentioned and using the significant experience that we’ve developed over our more than 20 years in the renewable business, we’ve been able to keep our construction program on track despite the significant disruptions that are occurring both globally and locally. Energy Resources’ 2020 wind turbine deliveries remain ahead of schedule, and we are not currently experiencing any significant equipment or labor issues at any of the more than 5,000 megawatts of wind and solar projects that we expect to complete this year. While we continue to monitor this situation closely, we expect that all of our planned 2020 renewable construction projects will achieve their in-service dates this year and believe that we will extend our track record of never having missed a PTC deadline on one of our wind projects.  Energy Resources’ track record of execution has been a key competitive advantage over time. In periods of uncertainty like we are currently experiencing, we expect customers will increasingly want confidence in a company’s ability to deliver on its commitments. Energy Resources’ extensive experience, combined with our customer, supplier, contractor, and financing relationships all separate us from other developers during these challenging times. In addition, we expect that some of our competitors may falter as a result of these challenges, and we will look to leverage any opportunities that this may present. To support the execution of FPL, Gulf Power and Energy Resources’ strategic objectives, over the past several months we have focused on ensuring NextEra Energy’s continued strong access to capital. The strength of NextEra Energy’s balance sheet and access to ample liquidity have always been and will always continue to be a core strategic focus for us. In times of financial market disruption like we’ve recently experienced, the value of balance sheet strength and access to liquidity have become even more apparent. We entered the year with meaningful cushion against our credit metrics and access to significant liquidity through the largest and most diversified bank group in our sector and maintenance of the industry’s largest credit facilities.  In the middle of February, we issued $2.5 billion in equity units to add additional cushion against our credit metrics and further supplement our liquidity. Additionally, since the market disruption began, we have further improved our liquidity position with an additional roughly $4 billion in longer term financings, including $1.1 billion in FPL first mortgage bonds, $1.25 billion of capital holdings debentures, and an additional $1.8 billion in capital holdings term loans. Following these issuances, NextEra Energy now has approximately $12 billion in liquidity to help support the largest capital investment program in our history, and we plan to continue to be prudent in our financing plan going forward. In summary, NextEra Energy remains well positioned to continue to execute over both the near and long-term horizons. Over a long period of time, we have focused on building a business that is resilient and able to deliver for our customers and shareholders, regardless of the economic and market conditions. We remain laser focused on extending that track record today. Even throughout the greatest market dislocations last month, NextEra Energy maintained ongoing access to capital, which is a reflection of the strength of its balance sheet as well as the overall resilience of NextEra Energy’s underlying businesses. FPL and Gulf Power operate in what we believe is one of the most constructive regulatory environments in the country. The strength of FPL and Gulf Power’s balance sheets and capital structures combined with the constructive, stable and forward-thinking approach of Florida’s regulatory environment and our long track record of execution should provide investors confidence that both companies will continue to be able to deliver for customers and perform well in a variety of economic environments. At Energy Resources, the portfolio is focused on long-term contracted clean energy projects with high credit quality customers, which we expect will be largely insulated from the changes in the underlying economy.  Despite the current economic challenges and as a result of the strength and diversity of NextEra Energy’s underlying businesses, I will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted earnings per share expectation ranges in 2020, 2021 and 2022, while at the same time maintaining our strong credit ratings and, most importantly, continuing to reliably deliver for our customers. While our expectations always assume normal weather and operating conditions, I have confidence in our ability to meet these expectations even when accounting for a reasonable range of impacts and outcomes that may result from the current pandemic.  Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners. While the COVID-19 pandemic has created significant uncertainty throughout the economy, NextEra Energy Partners remains well positioned to continue to deliver on its objectives and its commitments. We do not currently expect any material financial or operational impacts as a result of the pandemic. Additionally, as a result of the actions that we took last year, including two significant acquisitions, the organic growth investments that are being executed and the steps taken to reduce its overall cost of capital, NextEra Energy Partners entered 2020 particularly well positioned. This favorable positioning is even more valuable during times of uncertainty like we are experiencing today.  The benefit of last year’s execution is apparent in our first quarter results with adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution increasing roughly 30% and 200% respectively year-over-year. We expect to achieve NextEra Energy Partners’ 2020 distribution growth objectives while maintaining a trailing 12-month payout ratio in the mid-70% range, even after excluding cash distributions from our Desert Sunlight projects, highlighting the significant flexibility NEP has going forward. While we will continue to be opportunistic, the favorable position with which NextEra Energy Partners entered the year gives it the flexibility to achieve its long-term distribution growth objectives without the need to make any acquisitions until 2022, one year later than we had previously disclosed.  NextEra Energy Partners’ liquidity position also supports its flexibility in achieving its long-term growth objectives. At the end of the first quarter, NextEra Energy Partners maintained a net liquidity position, including cash on hand, of approximately $650 million. NextEra Energy Partners’ only near-term debt maturity is a $300 million convertible debt issuance that matures in September of this year which may be converted to net units if the conversion price is achieved. Without any near-term acquisition needs and no other corporate level debt maturities until 2024, NextEra Energy Partners maintains significant liquidity to help achieve its objectives.  The steps that NextEra Energy Partners has executed in the past year, such as the upsize and extension of its revolving credit facility as well as the project recapitalizations that create significant project finance debt capacity within the NEP portfolio, give us confidence that sufficient liquidity will be maintained. We also expect that the diversification of financing alternatives that NEP has pursued since its IPO will provide flexibility and continued access to capital, regardless of potential disruption in the capital markets. By leveraging the significant private infrastructure capital that has a strong demand for high quality, long-term contracted clean energy assets, NextEra Energy Partners maintains an attractive additional financing source.  In summary, we believe NEP is well positioned to execute on accretive acquisitions for LP unit holders going forward. With the tremendous expected long-term renewables growth combined with the strength of NextEra Energy Partners’ existing portfolio and continued access to low cost sources of capital, we believe NEP is uniquely positioned to take advantage of the disruptive factors reshaping the energy industry. With access to Energy Resources’ unparalleled portfolio of renewables projects that now totals roughly 25 gigawatts, including assigned backlog, as well as the ability to execute on third party acquisitions and organic growth opportunities, we have as much confidence in NextEra Energy Partners’ long-term future as we ever have had. We look forward to delivering on that potential over the coming years. In closing, while the COVID-19 pandemic has created significant uncertainty throughout the economy, it has not changed the fundamental value proposition of NextEra Energy or NextEra Energy Partners. Over a long period of time, we’ve focused on building resilient companies that are able to deliver on all their commitments throughout market and economic cycles, and we entered the current period of disruption uniquely well positioned. Despite the ongoing challenges, the core strategic focus across all of our businesses remains unchanged, and we believe we are well positioned to deliver on our objectives going forward. I’ll now turn the call over to Rebecca to review the first quarter results. 
Rebecca Kujawa: Thank you Jim, and good morning everyone. Let’s now turn to the detailed results, beginning with FPL. For the first quarter of 2020, FPL reported net income of $642 million or $1.31 per share. Earnings per share increased $0.09 year-over-year. Regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 9% over the same quarter last year and was the principal driver of FPL’s net income growth of roughly 9%. FPL’s capital expenditures were approximately $1.4 billion for the quarter, and we expect our full year capital investments to be between $5.8 billion and $6.3 billion. FPL’s reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.6% for the 12 months ending March 2020, which is at the upper end of the allowed band of 9.6% to 11.6% under our current rate agreement. During the quarter, we utilized $149 million of reserve amortization to achieve our target regulatory ROE, leaving FPL with a balance of $744 million. The amount of reserve amortization that FPL utilized this quarter was below that which was utilized in the first quarter of 2019. As we’ve previously discussed, FPL historically utilizes more reserve amortization in the first half of the year given the pattern of its underlying revenues and expenses, and we expect this year to be no different. We continue to expect that FPL will end 2020 with a sufficient amount of reserve amortization to continue operating under the base rate settlement agreement through 2021, creating further customer benefits by avoiding a base rate increase during this time. Turning to our development efforts, we recently filed an updated 10-year site plan for FPL and Gulf Power that highlights the next phase of smart capital investment opportunities across Florida systems. The filing reflects an expectation that FPL and Gulf Power will begin to operate as an integrated electric system in 2022. As we’ve previously discussed, since the acquisition closed in 2019, FPL and Gulf Power have been reviewing the potential benefits of merging into a single larger Florida utility company. Based on this review, the companies expect that a merger will create both operational and financial benefits for its customers. As a result, FPL and Gulf Power plan to take additional steps to merge over the coming months and continue to expect to file a combined rate case in the first quarter of 2021 for new rates effective in January of 2022.  The combined 10-year site plan projects an approximately 70% increase in the amount of zero emission electricity that is generated in 2029 relative to 2019 as a result of FPL’s continued rapid expansion of solar energy through the execution of its 30 by ‘30 plan. By the end of this decade, FPL projects it will have more than 10,000 megawatts of installed solar capacity, including nearly 1,600 megawatts within the current Gulf Power service territory. Of this total capacity, approximately 1,500 megawatts are expected to be constructed under FPL’s recently approved Solar Together program, which is the nation’s largest community solar program. Since the official launch of the program last month, customer demand across all rate classes has been substantial with demand from residential customers in one week surpassing the total residential private solar capacity that has been installed over the past 10 years. This strong demand is a reflection of increasing customer interest in cost-effective, clean energy solutions. The innovative program is expected to generate $249 million of total net cost savings for participating and non-participating customers over its life. Beyond the significant solar expansion, the 10-year site plan also highlights FPL’s other efforts to supply its customers with energy that is both clean and affordable. Relative to last year’s site plan, there is a dramatic increase in the battery storage deployment with a total of approximately 1,200 megawatts of storage capacity now expected by 2029. Additionally, the site plan reflects FPL eliminating essentially all of the coal from its integrated system, including the phase-out of its last operating coal plant within Florida later this year. Finally, this year’s site plan reflects FPL further diversifying its generation portfolio with the elimination of the combined-cycle natural gas plants at FPL and Gulf Power that were previously expected to be constructed in the middle of this decade. This plan reflects our belief that renewable generation, and particularly solar paired with battery storage in Florida, is an increasingly cost effective form of generation in most parts of the U.S. As FPL and Gulf Power execute on these opportunities to further modernize their combined generation fleet, we expect to enhance our customer value proposition while also reducing our CO2 emissions rate, which is already among the lowest in the nation and is targeted to be 67% below the 2005 U.S. electric industry average by 2030. Despite the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, all of FPL’s major capital projects remain on track and on budget. In late January, the first six Solar Together projects totaling approximately 450 megawatts entered service. An additional 450 megawatts of Solar Together sites, as well as the final 300 megawatts of solar being built under the solar base rate adjustment, or SOBR mechanism of FPL’s base rate settlement agreement, remain on track to be placed in service this year. Beyond solar, construction of the highly efficient, roughly 1,200 megawatt Dania Beach clean energy center remains on schedule and on budget as it continues to advance towards its projected commercial operations date in 2022.  We continue to expect that FPL’s ongoing smart investment opportunities will support a compound annual growth rate and regulatory capital employed of approximately 9% from 2018 through 2022, while further enhancing our best-in-class value proposition. Let me now turn to Gulf Power, which reported first quarter 2020 net income of $40 million or $0.08 per share. Gulf’s capital expenditures were $340 million for the quarter as it continues to execute on smart capital investments for the benefit of customers, and we continue to expect its full year capital investments to be between $800 million and $900 million.  As a result of these ongoing investments, regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 25% year-over-year. Gulf Power’s reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.2% for the 12 months ending March 2020. The overall execution of Gulf Power’s capital program continues to progress well. Gulf Power’s first solar project, the roughly 75 megawatt Blue Indigo solar energy center, was placed in service earlier this month. All of its other major capital investments, including the North Florida resiliency connection and the Plant Crist coal to natural gas conversion continue to remain on track. Similar to S&P’s one-notch upgrade of both FPL and Gulf Power in late December, Fitch recently upgraded Gulf’s credit ratings by one notch as well, citing its strong financial position resulting from the reduction in operating costs and ongoing modernization efforts We are pleased with these upgrades, which we believe are a reflection of successful execution since the Gulf Power acquisition closed, and which further strengthen NextEra Energy’s overall credit position. Similar to other parts of the country, the Florida economy is being impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Recent economic data reflects Florida unemployment rates beginning to increase and a significant decline in consumer confidence. As Florida continues to deal with the impacts of the pandemic, we are encouraged that the trailing seven-day average of new COVID-19 cases has modestly declined in the past two weeks. While it is unclear at this point how severely the economy will be impacted, we believe the strength with which Florida entered this crisis combined with the continued attraction of its low tax, pro-business policies position Florida well for a rebound once the worst of the pandemic is behind us. During the quarter, FPL’s average number of customers continued its recent trend of strong underlying growth, increasing by approximately 72,000 from the comparable prior year quarter. FPL’s first quarter retails sales increased 3.3% year-over-year, driven primarily by a favorable weather comparison. On a weather-normalized basis, FPL’s retail sales declined by 0.7% as customer growth was more than offset by a reduction in underlying usage per customer.  We continue to evaluate the effects of the pandemic on FPL’s retail sales, which are heavily weighted to residential customers at more than 50%, and we have a very limited exposure to industrial load at less than 3%. Additionally, since approximately 40% of FPL’s load is cooling related and therefore important for both comfort and building maintenance, we expect this demand driver to remain relatively stable, especially as we head into the warmer months of the year. Weather-normalized retail sales for the past four weeks are down approximately 2% relative to the prior two years, with increased residential sales partially offsetting declines in other classes; however, this underlying usage decline has been more than offset by strong weather with overall usage in the past four weeks increasing nearly 10% relative to the prior two-year average. While the ultimate impacts of the pandemic on underlying usage cannot be known at this time, we continue to expect the flexibility provided by our reserve amortization mechanism to offset any fluctuation in retail sales or bad debt expense and support a regulatory ROE at the upper end of the allowed band of 9.6% to 11.6% under our current agreement.  For Gulf Power, the average number of customers increased approximately 1.1% versus the comparable prior year quarter. Gulf Power’s first quarter retail sales increased roughly 0.6% year-over-year as customer growth and an increase in underlying usage per customer were largely offset by an unfavorable weather comparison relative to 2019. Over the last four weeks, Gulf Power’s weather-normalized retail sales have declined approximately 9% versus the prior two-year average. Similar to FPL, over this period strong weather offset the decline in underlying usage and overall retail sales increased nearly 4% versus the prior two-year average. As a reminder, unlike FPL, Gulf Power does not have a reserve amortization mechanism under its settlement agreement to offset the fluctuations in revenues or costs, so any variability will therefore have more impact to Gulf’s earnings and ROE than on FPL. As we have often discussed, weather-normalization is imprecise and is particularly so when evaluating short periods of time. We are providing our assessment of the changes in load in an effort to be transparent, but caution that these should be considered as indicative and assessed together with the overall changes in usage. Additional details on retail sales at FPL and Gulf Power are included in the appendix of today’s presentation. Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported first quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $318 million or $0.65 per share and adjusted earnings of $529 million or $1.08 per share. This is an increase in adjusted earnings per share of $0.11 or approximately 11% from last year’s comparable quarter results. As a reminder, last year’s first quarter results have been restated to reflect the results of our NextEra Energy transmission projects formerly reported in the corporate and other segment.  New investments, including more than 1,500 megawatts of new contracted wind and solar projects that were commissioned during 2019, added $0.08 per share. Contributions from existing generation assets also increased by $0.09 per share due to an improvement in wind resource and increased PTC volume from our re-powered wind projects. Fleet-wide wind resource was at 96%, the long term average, versus 91% during the first quarter of 2019. Also contributing favorably were NextEra Energy transmission, where contributions increased by $0.04 versus 2019, and our gas infrastructure business, including our existing pipeline which increased results by $0.02 year-over-year.  These favorable contributions were partially offset by lower contributions from our customer supply and trading business, which declined $0.02 versus the particularly strong first quarter last year. All other impacts reduced results by $0.10 per share, primarily as a result of increased interest expense reflecting continued growth in the business and share dilution. As Jim mentioned earlier, Energy Resources’ development team had another strong quarter of origination. Since the last call, we have added 1,590 megawatts of renewable projects to our backlog, including 600 megawatts of wind, 420 megawatts of solar, 457 megawatts of battery storage, and 113 megawatts of wind re-powering projects. With this quarter’s backlog additions and with two and a half years remaining in the period, we are now well within the 2019 to 2022 renewables development ranges that we introduced in the middle of last year. At this early stage, we are tracking extremely well against the total development forecast for this period and our backlog continues to track against the assumptions supporting our previously announced financial expectations. For the post-2022 period, our backlog now includes wind, solar and storage projects totalling approximately 3,200 megawatts, placing us far ahead of our historical originations at this stage and further supporting Energy Resources’ long-term growth visibility. Beyond renewables, we continue to work with our partners on Mountain Valley Pipeline and with the relevant agencies to resolve the issues related to MVP’s biological opinion. We are encouraged by the tone of the oral arguments at the Supreme Court on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline’s case related to its Appalachian Trail crossing authorization and remain hopeful that the Fourth Circuit Court’s original decision will be overturned, resolving similar issues for MVP.  We are also evaluating the recent Montana federal court decision supporting to enjoin the Army Corps of Engineers from issuing permits under the Nationwide 12 program. We believe the ruling out of the court is incorrect and anticipate that the federal government will seek to fix the situation rapidly. Assuming a successful resolution along the currently expected timeline of all of these issues, we continue to target a full in-service date for the pipeline during 2020 and expect an overall project estimate of approximately $5.4 billion. Turning now to consolidated results for NextEra Energy, for the first quarter of 2020, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $421 million or $0.86 per share. NextEra Energy’s 2020 first quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $1.17 billion and $2.38 per share respectively. Adjusted earnings from the corporate and other segment were roughly flat year-over-year. As Jim mentioned, NextEra Energy’s current liquidity position is approximately $12 billion, ensuring that we are well positioned to execute on our strategic plans regardless of potential market disruptions. The financing that we have executed year-to-date represents a significant portion of our expected 2020 financing plan, and we remain confident about our ability to execute the financing plan for the balance of the year and beyond. In the near term, we have the positive cash balances helping to ensure ample liquidity as we execute on our current investment programs. Energy Resources currently has commitments for substantially all of its expected 2020 tax equity financings, which we expect to close as the renewable projects are placed in service later this year. The financial expectations which we extended last year through 2022 remain unchanged. We continue to expect that NextEra Energy’s adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate to be in a range of 6% to 8% through 2021 off of the 2018 adjusted EPS of $7.70, plus the accretion of $0.15 and $0.20 in 2020 and 2021 respectively from the Florida acquisitions. For 2020, we continue to expect our adjusted EPS to be in the range of $8.70 to $9.20, and as Jim highlighted, we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of this range. For 2022, we expect to grow adjusted EPS in a range of 6% to 8% off of the 2021 adjusted EPS, translating to a range of $10 to $10.75 per share. From 2018 to 2022, we continue to expect that operating cash flow will grow roughly in line with our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. As Jim noted, while our expectations always assume normal weather and operating conditions, as we consider a reasonable range of impacts related to the current pandemic, we feel comfortable with the expectations that we have outlined. As we announced in February, the board of NextEra Energy approved an updated dividend policy for beyond 2020 which is expected to translate to a growth rate in dividends per share of roughly 10% per year through at least 2022, off of a 2020 base. The board’s approval to continue to grow our dividends per share in excess of our expected adjusted earnings per share growth rate is a reflection of the continued strength in earnings and operating cash flow growth at NextEra Energy, and we remain well positioned to support the dividend policy going forward.  Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners, which delivered outstanding operational and financial performance for the quarter. First quarter adjusted EBITDA was $294 million and cash available for distribution, including all distributions from our Desert Sunlight projects in both periods, was $130 million, up 31% and more than 200% respectively against the prior year comparable quarter. Including full contributions from the Desert Sunlight projects, NextEra Energy Partners would have achieved CAFD growth of 187% versus 2019. Contributions from portfolio acquisitions and an improvement in wind resource were the principal drivers of growth. New projects added $54 million of adjusted EBITDA and $44 million of cash available for distributions.  For the NEP portfolio, wind resource was 98% of the long-term average versus 89% in the first quarter of 2019. Cash available for distribution also benefited from a reduction in project-level debt service primarily as a result of the retirement of the outstanding notes at our Genesis project and the receipt of higher year-over-year payco [ph] payments. The reduction in project-level debt service was partially offset by higher corporate level interest expense. As a reminder, these results are net of IDR fees since we consider these as an operating expense. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide. Yesterday, the NextEra Energy Partners’ board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.555 per common unit, or $2.22 per common unit on an annualized basis, continuing our track record of growing distributions at the top end of our 12% to 15% per year growth rate range. As Jim mentioned earlier, the transactions that NextEra Energy Partners executed in 2019 allowed it to enter 2020 well positioned to withstand the recent market turmoil.  During 2019, NextEra Energy Partners raised approximately $1.8 billion through three convertible equity portfolio financings. With low initial coupons, the convertible equity portfolio financings provide more cash to LP unit holders, which we expect will allow NextEra Energy Partners to acquire fewer assets to achieve the same level of future distribution growth and therefore also reduce future financing needs. The benefits of these financings are a large reason that NextEra Energy Partners now has the flexibility to execute on its long-term distribution growth objectives without the need for additional asset acquisitions until 2022. At times of market stress, reduced future asset and financing needs are a tremendous advantage and help further improve NextEra Energy Partner’s ability to execute on its long-term growth objectives.  As NextEra Energy Partners advanced towards its organic growth investments in 2019, it took steps to support the financing for these investment opportunities as well. Through the recapitalization of the Texas pipelines, a project finance facility related to the Meade pipeline expansion project, and its advance discussions for tax equity financing related to the two wind re-powerings, NextEra Energy Partners expects to finance these accretive investments through attractive sources of long-term capital.  Last year, NextEra Energy Partners also purchased all of the outstanding holding company and operating company notes at our Genesis project. Assuming favorable resolution for our PG&E related assets, about which we continue to remain confident, the cash flows from the Genesis project can support significant long-term financing capacity. Additionally, following PG&E’s emergence from bankruptcy, we expect cash that is currently trapped at our Desert Sunlight 250 and 300 projects to be distributed.  As of the end of the first quarter, approximately $48 million of distributions have been restricted or withheld at the projects. The Genesis financing capacity and the release of the Desert Sunlight trapped cash are additional potential sources of capital and liquidity for NextEra Energy Partners.  Finally, over the last year NextEra Energy Partners’ revolving credit facility was upsized by $500 million to $1.25 billion, and the term was extended out to 2025. This incremental liquidity further supports NextEra Energy Partners’ financing position and provides flexibility in how NEP executes on its long-term growth objectives.  Prudent capital management is a hallmark of our approach to how we manage all of our businesses. As a result of the actions taken over the past year, we believe NextEra Energy Partners is particularly well positioned to achieve its long-term growth expectations.  Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners’ expectations, which remain unchanged. Including full contributions to PG&E related projects, year-end 2020 run rate cash available for distribution is expected to be in a range of $560 million to $640 million, reflecting calendar year 2021 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at the end of 2020. Excluding all contributions from the Desert Sunlight projects, NextEra Energy Partners continues to expect year-end 2020 run rate for CAFD to be in the range of $505 million to $585 million.  Year-end 2020 run rate adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in a range of $1.225 billion to $1.4 billion, which assumes full contributions from the projects related to PG&E as revenue is expected to continue to be recognized.  Similar to NextEra Energy, while our expectations always assume normal weather and operating conditions, as we consider a reasonable range of impacts related to the current pandemic, we continue to feel comfortable with these expectations. As a reminder, all of our expectations include the impact of anticipated IDR fees as we treat these as an operating expense. From a base of our fourth quarter 2019 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $2.14, we continue to see 12% to 15% growth per year in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2024. We expect the annualized rate of fourth quarter 2020 distribution that is payable in February 2021 to be in a range of $2.40 to $2.46 per common unit. As I previously noted, NextEra Energy Partners now expects to be able to achieve its long-term distribution growth expectations without the need for additional asset acquisitions until 2022.  In summary and as Jim highlighted, we continue to believe that despite the ongoing challenges in the market and the economy, both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners continue to execute and maintain their excellent prospects for growth. We continue to remain enthusiastic about our future and are focused on delivering shareholder value going forward. That concludes our prepared remarks, and with that we will open up the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Oh, it looks like we’re going to go with Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. 
Shahriar Pourreza: Hey guys, good morning. 
Rebecca Kujawa: Good morning 
Shahriar Pourreza: A couple questions here. First on the regulatory side, we’ve seen commissions get a bit challenged in 2020, proceedings, they’re delaying schedules. In some states the process to reengage is kind of open-ended. I know you have one of your peers who’s looking to file in Florida later this year and you guys aren’t planning to file a GRC until early next year, combining the two entities.  That said, you guys are in the process of preparing, you’re fact finding, you’re meeting with various stakeholders within and outside of NextEra. Are you seeing any sort of COVID-related delays, especially as you’re currently setting up to file a rate case in early next year?
Rebecca Kujawa: Shahriar, I appreciate the question, and of course regulatory--you know, any sort of procedures and questions that we have in front of the regulators are top of mind to us, but as we’ve highlighted over the last couple of months and very typical with prior preparation, our focus for this year ahead of our potential filing at the beginning of next year is really preparation and laying a lot of groundwork. At this stage in April, we’ve got a lot of time between now and year-end and really into the beginning of next year to evaluate how things have changed and adapt accordingly.  But at this point, our team’s focus is very much on the preparation, and we continue to progress well on that.
Shahriar Pourreza: Got it, then just on near, obviously a very solid addition to the backlog, and you’ve certainly--you and Jim gave a pretty good development landscape in the prepared remarks, but are you seeing any hesitation on the part of counterparties? Does the current economic backdrop kind of deteriorate some of these counterparties? You still have about 4.5 to 5 gigawatts that are waiting for PPAs over the next couple of years, so I’m just curious if you’re seeing any kind of counterparties balk.
Rebecca Kujawa: Shahriar, we’re very pleased with where we are. Obviously highlighted in the prepared remarks that we are now well within the range for the development expectations that we laid out last year, which at this stage in progression towards the end of 2022, we are very well positioned to execute on everything that we’ve laid out. More specifically in the last couple of weeks, as we also highlighted in the prepared remarks, John and the Energy Resources team have executed terrifically well and many, if not most of those contracts that we highlighted have been signed since the pandemic was starting to emerge and ultimately top of mind of our customers.  If you think about the backdrop of why that might be, renewables are the least cost form of generation and in many cases are far cheaper than the alternative form of generation that’s continuing to operate very expensive and inefficient, coal and some nuclear facilities, and our customers will save their customers money when they turn those plants off and replace them with renewables. We would expect that as our customers focus on what’s best for their customers, they will continue to want to build renewables into their portfolios and we’re very well positioned to execute.
John Ketchum: Shahriar, this is John. I may just add onto that. We are seeing just a terrific development environment in front of us, for all the reasons that Rebecca mentioned. The fact that we buy cheaper, we build cheaper, we operate cheaper, we have the best development skills in the industry, customers more than anything right now want confidence and certainty that a project is going to get built, so we are actually seeing more opportunities come our way. Given that we compete against a lot of small players in both solar and wind, access to capital and a balance sheet, which we have, are extremely important and are something that we plan to leverage to create even more opportunities going forward. So actually, the current environment has created a better environment for us.
Shahriar Pourreza: Perfect. Jim, just one strategy question for you - I know you love to address these. There’s obviously been a lot of valuation dispersions in this space - you know, Jacksonville and Santee Cooper, it looks like they’re done. You’ve been highlighted in media with potential interest in Kansas and Missouri. Do you have any sort of refreshed thoughts, especially given the recent lost opportunities I just mentioned, as you think about consolidation? 
James Robo: So first of all, just to address Santee Cooper for a moment, Santee Cooper is by no means done. I think you all saw the speaker of the house sent a letter to Santee Cooper, calling them a rogue agency. The governor wants to sell them, so it’s not done. The disagreements in the senate around what to do with Santee Cooper led to a bit of a standoff around the budget in the middle of the pandemic, and you can--you know, obviously it’s a topic that is quite hotly debated in South Carolina. But I would say by no means is Santee Cooper done, and there remains a lot of energy still behind wanting to sell Santee Cooper. Just strategically overall from an M&A standpoint, I always like to just remind everyone always what our gating elements of anything that we would do. It has to make sense strategically, has to be significantly accretive. You all know how we finance these things historically - it’s been with very little risk. I’m not a big believer in financing these things in a way that either takes risk or puts the balance sheet at risk. A strong credit rating is really critical to us and critical to our strategy, so all those things remain the same. I think what you’re going to see in terms of the environment obviously is with the uncertainty in the financial markets and the uncertainty with the economy that’s been driven by the pandemic, I think you’re going to see counterparties take a pause. That’s a natural reaction to the environment that we’re in. But our strategic thinking around it remains unchanged and our approach to it remains unchanged, in that it has to be strategic, has to be accretive, has to be consistent with a very strong balance sheet.
Shahriar Pourreza: Congrats, guys, on these results. Congrats again.
Rebecca Kujawa: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Steve Fleishman: Good morning. Just a couple questions on NEP. Initially the extension of not needing any new assets, I guess through the end of ’21, to meet your dividend growth targets, is that also true for any equity financing through then?
Rebecca Kujawa: Yes, essentially Steve. There wouldn’t be any need. Obviously we have the existing convertible equity portfolio financings and the convertible to debt that would potentially convert into equity, and it’s later this year, but there’s no new issuances required. We highlighted on the prepared remarks that we have significant liquidity far in excess of what we would need, particularly since we don’t need acquisitions to meet those distribution growth targets until 2022.
Steve Fleishman: Then secondly, I think there was a comment, and I guess it was Jim’s slide, that the private infrastructure capital demand for high quality clean energy assets provides attractive financing source, even in this environment or regardless of market conditions. Maybe you can give a little more color on your thought process there.
Rebecca Kujawa: Yes Steve, as you well know, one of the things that we’ve been particularly attuned to over the last, call it 18 months, is that there is a lot of private infrastructure capital, and the evidence of that is apparent with the convertible equity portfolio financings that we’ve executed since that time. Since the--you know, I’ll just call it the pandemic time frame, so in the last couple of months, there has continued to be a significant amount of inbound interest and continuing conversations with a number of those parties to provide capital to NEP in various forms, so we have not seen any changes in interest moving forward and continue to be very confident in our ability to leverage those type of capital resources as we move forward.  We’re fortunate we’re in a position that we don’t need to do anything, as we highlighted, until 2022, but we of course will continue to be opportunistic, and to the extent that there are good opportunities for NEP that are attractive and accretive to NEP unit holders, we may well take advantage of that. 
Steve Fleishman: Okay. Then a last question, just on renewables overall. I think if I understood right, you’re seeing the same amount of demand for growth, so no change there. John, you mentioned the fact that people maybe want a stronger counterparty these days, but then the other thing I think I heard someone say was--it might have been Jim, saying the opportunities might be there more for acquisitions or projects that people struggle to get done in time. Could you maybe talk on that last point and how meaningful that opportunity could be?
James Robo: Steve, I think it could be quite meaningful. If you look back at ’08 and ’09, we had a lot of opportunities in that time where you had developers who didn’t have great access to capital, and we were a source of capital for them.  I just want to reiterate something that John said. If anything, the renewable market is better right now that I ever expected it to be. I just got through with a review of our entire portfolio of projects and activity last week, and honestly I was really struck by the acceleration of activity that we’re seeing, so it is full speed ahead on that front and I was very encouraged to see that. It was really, as we said in the prepared remarks, a real testament to the strength of our development team and the strength of our pipeline and the strength of our people and our relationships.
Steve Fleishman: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey guys, thanks for the question. Just coming back to the first part with the Florida utilities quickly, when you think about the reserve amortization, the available balance here, the trajectory for load as you see it, and again I understand there’s numerous caveats, I think I heard it in the commentary but just want to clarify - confidence that the balance that you have for this year will suffice, and then perhaps more importantly and critically, as you look towards whatever that normalization is in subsequent years and a rate case cycle, how do you think about implementing something like reserve amortization subsequently again as you look at the post-rate case period here to minimize some of the earnings vol?
Rebecca Kujawa: Okay, let me start with the reserve amortization. We highlighted in the remarks that the balance is now at $744 million and we continue to have confidence that cost containment and all of the factors that are pluses and minuses to that reserve amortization balance will continue to be sufficient for us to operate under the settlement agreement through the end of 2021, so really no change to our expectations that we, again, would file a rate case in ’21 for new rates effective in 2022. Reserve amortization has been, we think, a very constructive concept in Florida regulation, particularly FPL over a number of different settlement agreements and ultimately rate case outcomes, but it has come about from settlements, so it’s not something you would assume that we will have going forward. But we think it has been very good for customers because it’s been able to provide long term rate stability for them through a variety of conditions, including the one that we find ourselves in today. We are very pleased with the constructive nature of regulations that we have been operating on, and again particularly so for the benefit of customers.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it, excellent. Then coming back to the renewable side of the business, obviously you guys have an incredible amount of confidence given the backdrop here. You’re not seeing even any slippage in timelines, especially as you think about the C&I customers here? I know the gross amount of backlog that you guys are talking about seems pretty confident, but even just execution and prospective backlog that you would conceivably add in 2022, that is even staying relatively firm? I’ll leave it there.
John Ketchum: No drop-off, no slowdown. One of the things that we were able to add this year, or this quarter, was 600 megawatts to 2022 and beyond of wind, which is just a terrific head start, that we’re only here in the first quarter of 2020, so just tons of time to continue to be able to work the wind development pipeline over the next four years, with PTC being essentially at 60% through 2024. Just a lot of demand, a lot of folks that own peakers, a lot of folks that own coal very aggressively looking at renewable as an option with ESG as a tailwind. Knowing that even if we are in a recessionary environment, being able to pivot to renewables not only brings a clean energy story but it also makes their economies more competitive and lowers bills for customers at a time they need it most, so that’s what’s really driving demand.
Rebecca Kujawa: I was just going to add to that something about the--you know, one of the important reasons why we continue to be confident about our ability to reach our CODs, keep our projects on track and on budget, is really something we’ve highlighted for years now - our focus on our supply chain and developing relationships with our vendors, strategic partners in many cases. As we went into this year, knowing that it was a significant construction development year at all of our businesses, we had intense focus on our supply chain. We always do, but even more so this year with how complex and intertwined it may be with how many priorities and the deliverables we have. Entering into that posture and facing the circumstances we find ourselves in now positioned us well to manage through these. We pick top quality suppliers where we are a significant customer to them, and we’ve had many instances over the last couple of weeks where we’ve worked closely with them to ensure that our projects stay on track and on budget. I don’t think that should be underestimated. Focusing on long term total cost of ownership and ability for our suppliers to deliver is really paying off well for us in this type of environment. 
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. Last quick clarification - on the NWP12 permit you guys alluded to, seems like you’ve got pretty good confidence that they’re going to narrow that back to just Montana, but process-wise, make sure I’ve got it right there on your confidence level?
James Robo: Julien, I think it’s premature to say what’s going to happen with that. I think it’s obviously a condition to--it being dealt with quickly is a condition to us being able to deliver the pipeline this year. We think the ruling was incorrect and we think government is going to aggressively try to correct it. That said, it’s still early on. We haven’t really gotten a lot of feedback yet from the government about what their approach is going to be, and we are continuing to evaluate it. I think it’s early days, honestly Julien, is what I would say to you right now on that.  If our prepared remarks led you to believe that we had confidence that it’s going to be done--that it’s going to get resolved quickly, that was not what we were trying to say. We were trying to say that for us to build the pipeline this year, it needs to be resolved quickly, and it remains to be seen whether it will be. It’s something that we as a team are very--along with our partners, are very focused on working with the government to get it resolved, and get it resolved quickly. 
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent, thank you guys. Best of luck, stay safe.
Operator: Our next question will come from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Stephen Byrd: Hi, good morning.
Rebecca Kujawa: Good morning Stephen.
Stephen Byrd: I wanted to see if you had a strong view on the potential for further federal support for clean energy. I’m thinking just more broadly as part of stimulus efforts that are underway. Do you see anything that might translate into concrete additional support?
James Robo: Stephen, it’s Jim. I think it’s too early to tell. I think there is certainly some interest from the Democrats to include additional clean energy support in another stimulus bill potentially around--you know, with a focus on infrastructure. But as you’ve seen over the last several weeks, things are extraordinarily fluid in Washington, and I would just say it’s too soon to tell. I think it’s something as an industry that we need to be very thoughtful about in terms of how we approach it and have it be truly focused on stimulus and focused on the impacts of the pandemic, and make sure that that’s the focus of any of the efforts that go on in the industry. You know, we’re staying obviously very close to it and time will tell, but as I said, I think it’s a little early and things are quite fluid.
Stephen Byrd: Understood, very fair. Just one last one. You’ve given some good info on power demand impacts from COVID-19. I’m wondering if you could just speak to the customer class impacts - there’s a lot of questions about the magnitude of uplift in terms of residential demand versus the downward movement for commercial industrial. I’m curious what you’re seeing on the residential side, if you’re able to share that.
Rebecca Kujawa: Yes Stephen, one of the things that we did, we put it in the appendix, Slide 25 if you have a chance to take a look at it, is to give you some sensitivities for the revenue impacts for a percentage--you know, 1% change in sales, also the breakdown of our composition of mix between residential, C&I--well, commercial, and then separately industrial. Obviously our load mix at FPL, which is the significant majority of the regulated load that we have in our business, is heavily weighted towards residential and small and medium commercial businesses. We have seen pick-up in residential, as we highlighted, and a slight down tick in commercial. But as I also highlighted in the prepared remarks, and very consistent with what we’ve said to you over a long period of time, our ability to dissect the impacts from weather versus underlying usage are pretty good over a long period of time, but in short discrete periods of time are more challenging, particularly when weather has a significant impact on load.  In these last couple of weeks since you would say that there have been significant impacts from pandemic, and officially the stay-at-home orders here in Florida were in effect, we’ve had very favorable weather, so it’s hard for us to dissect it, so we erred on the side of providing you some sensitivities so that you can make an assessment on your own as to what you think might happen and what would that would be in terms of cash revenues at FPL.  Again, to put a finer point to it, remember with reserve amortization that results in negligible or no impact. To the extent that we have reserve amortization available to us on an earnings basis, this would be just a cash impact.  To give context for what happened in the last major disruption to load, which was the 2008 - 2009 recession, obviously everywhere but including here, of course, in Florida, that was about a 4% to 6.5% effect to overall load demand, and that was over the course of the year, and obviously we’re midyear this year. That gives you some guideposts for how to think about it from the way that we’ve approached it so far.
Stephen Byrd: Understood. Yes, you’ve got a lot of insulation to the bottom line from the impacts from COVID. I’ll leave it there. Thank you very much. 
Rebecca Kujawa: Thank you Stephen.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Michael Weinstein: Hi guys. To what extent is wind re-powering at NEP responsible for or contributing to the ability to avoid drop-downs over the next year and a half to two years?
Rebecca Kujawa: Michael, it’s certainly a positive. As we, I think, announced these re-pairing opportunities at or near the investor conference last year and have planned for it in terms of how we would finance it and have the tax equity lined up to be able to finance that going forward, so it’s certainly a positive that will impact results for this year. It’s about $25 million worth of CAFD or so, as we’ve previously highlighted, so certainly a contributor.  Also a contributor were the other acquisitions that NEP made last year, as well as the recapitalizations that we executed on. It’s the confluence of acquisitions, both from Energy Resources as well as third parties, as well as the organic opportunities, so it’s a three-for in this case.
Michael Weinstein: I think last quarter, you also talked about the possibility of additional in 2024 due to the PTC extension. Have you ever quantified any of that, what that opportunity may be?
Rebecca Kujawa: We haven’t talked about additional re-powering opportunities with respect to NextEra Energy Partners. As we’d previously highlighted, from a re-powering opportunity we thought the opportunity was particularly strong through the end of 2020 to take advantage of the full 100% PTC re-upping. But actually this quarter, we’re announcing some re-powering opportunities in 2021 that will take advantage of the 80% PTC, so it’s a very positive opportunity for us.
Michael Weinstein: Right, got you. One last question about natural gas versus renewables. Natural gas has gotten a lot cheaper, and I’m just wondering how do renewables stack up on an LCOE basis these days against fossil fuels?
Rebecca Kujawa: I’m sorry, Michael - how does LCOEs for renewables stack up against--?
Michael Weinstein: Against fossil fuels. Fossil fuel prices have really come down, right?
Rebecca Kujawa: They definitely have come down, but you would hope that someone making a long-term planning decision will think about prices over a long period of time. As we highlighted for FPL’s 10-year site plan and we looked at what the costs are that we’re anticipating at Florida Power & Light and Gulf Power together, solar paired with battery storage are the least cost form of generation, and we’ve put all that pen to paper and included that in our 10-year site plan, and have now removed the two combined-cycle natural gas plants that we had previously in the forecast in the mid-2020s as a reflection of where we think costs are.  From our customer standpoint, again they operate in many different jurisdictions, in some cases wind will be particularly attractive, in some cases it’s solar. But if you keep in context the dollar per megawatt hour costs that we’ve continued to provide, which with incentives are for wind, anywhere in the teens to very low 20s for wind, even in low wind resource areas, and then for solar in the [30-plus] megawatt hour with incentives, and then post incentives continue to be very attractive in that $20 to $30 and $30 to $40 megawatt hour range, so very cost competitive even with where we think the fuel complex pricing is. But also, remember that coal and some nuclear facilities are our primary comparisons, and that hasn’t changed dramatically.
John Ketchum: Michael, this is John. One thing I would add to that is remember as oil prices have come down, rig counts have come down in the Permian, which means there’s a lot less associated gas, which has really actually helped natural gas prices, and we’ve seen a bit of an uptick in natural gas prices, particularly recently. When we are out originating new renewables, we really have not seen competition from gas-fired units for that reason. They still remain kind of in that $30 to $40 a megawatt hour range versus wind, which is still in the teens in most parts of the country, and then solar in that mid-20 range. So very, very competitive when you look at renewables versus gas-fired generation. The last thing I would add is just peakers. Remember gas-fired peakers not only are targets for new renewables, but also for battery storage. Battery storage costs have come down such that--you know, we mentioned the large standalone storage build-out that we have, the billion dollars going in, in ’21. There is a significant opportunity in almost every part of the country where batteries are now more economic than gas-fired peakers, even at today’s natural gas prices.
Michael Weinstein: Good news, thank you.
Operator: Our last question will come from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Michael Lapides: Thank you, guys for taking my question. I don’t know if this one is for Jim or John. I know you commented that your own renewable development plans remain on track, on schedule and financed. You have a great lens into the industry overall, obviously. Can you talk about where you think for the industry, maybe not for NextEra, where the biggest challenges are occurring? Are they in financing of projects, meaning tax equity markets? Are they in the supply chain? Is it more wind versus solar supply chain issues? Is it more keeping sites or potentially missing safe harbor dates? Can you just talk about the industry perspective, what you’re seeing in the competitive landscape, even if these are things that aren’t necessarily impacting NextEra?
John Ketchum: Sure. I think the first one would be supply chain, and Rebecca talked about that for a minute; but given the size of our spend across the complex, being right around north of $13 billion, we are almost always our suppliers’ largest customer. If we’re not, we’re their second largest in the world. If there are minor disruptions that come up, we’re able to pivot to other manufacturing facilities that that particular vendor may own, so we don’t see the same impact that perhaps a smaller player, whether it’s in wind and solar, would see. So while they may see supply chain disruptions, we don’t, just given the size and the sophistication and the buying power that we have. That’s the first one - supply chain is something that I would look at for other smaller players. The second one is access to capital. Again, we always get first dibs and first allocations on tax equity financing. In the script remarks, I think we already said we have all of our tax equity needs for 2020 fully allocated. That is not the case necessarily for smaller developers. Smaller developers might struggle, particularly to the extent that banks have less amount of taxable income, notwithstanding the five-year net operating loss carry-back that was passed, I think in the first or second federal restructuring, so we’re very well positioned from a tax equity standpoint, whereas maybe smaller developers might not be. I think for those two reasons, it could create project M&A opportunities for us, where some of these smaller developers need a rescue plan because they’re going to be running up against issues at the end of the year. I think they also--it’s not only on execution in terms of meeting year-end CODs, where we don’t see issues and we have the ability to navigate around them, but as customers now are looking for who to select to build renewables for them going forward, knowing that there’s a PTC declining clock, there’s an ITC declining clock, they want certainty. They want confidence that that developer is going to be around to be able to actually deliver, so in RFPs and just in customer interactions, we’re starting to see that theme play out more and more.  We feel really good about our ability to execute and we feel very bullish about our origination activities going forward for those reasons, which might not be the case of what you would hear from a smaller developer for those reasons.
Michael Lapides: John, thank you for that. One quick follow-up. In the supply chain, when you’re seeing it across the industry, obviously not impacting you guys, are the issues greater for smaller wind developers or smaller solar? Where are you seeing the bottlenecks within the industry more on the supply chain side?
John Ketchum: I think probably a little bit of both. It depends on where they’re sourcing from and which OEM that they're using. Some OEMs have more alternatives to parts of the country that are less--parts of the world that are less affected, but I think you’re going to see disruptions on both wind and solar for smaller developers. We have always made selections around our OEM providers and around our panel providers which are pretty diverse - inverters, things of that nature that give us a lot of flexibility, but a smaller developer may be beholden to one particular OEM that might not have the same amount of flexibility or one supplier, given how small their build is, that might have a disruption without the ability to pivot to somebody else.
Michael Lapides: Got it, thank you John. Much appreciated. 
John Ketchum: You’re welcome, Michael, thank you.
Operator: This concludes our question and answer session. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect.

With that, I will turn the call over to Jim.
James Robo: Thank you Matt, and good morning everyone. 2019 was a terrific year for both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. NextEra Energy’s performance was strong both financially and operationally, and we had outstanding execution on our initiatives to continue to drive future growth across the company.  By successfully executing on our plans, NextEra Energy extended its long track record of delivering value for shareholders with adjusted earnings per share of $8.37, up 8.7% from 2018. Over the past 15 years, we’ve now delivered compound annual growth and adjusted EPS of nearly 8.5%, which is the highest among all top 10 power companies who have achieved on average compound annual growth of less than 4% over the same period.  Amidst this significant growth, the company has maintained one of the strongest balance sheets and credit positions in the industry. In 2019, we delivered a total shareholder return of approximately 43%, significantly outperforming both the S&P 500 and the S&P 500 Utilities Index, and continuing to outperform both indices in terms of total shareholder return on a one, three, five, seven, and 10-year basis.  Over the past 15 years, we have outperformed all of the other companies in the S&P Utilities Index and 85% of the companies in the S&P 500 while more than tripling the total shareholder return of both indices. Although we are proud of our long-term track record of creating shareholder value, we remain utterly focused on the future and committed to continuing that track record going forward. During 2019, FPL successfully executed on its ongoing capital plan, including placing the highly efficient Okeechobee Clean Energy Center and an additional 300 megawatts of cost effective solar in service on time and on budget. Smart capital investments such as these help FPL improve its already best-in-class customer value proposition despite customer bills that were already nearly 30% below the national average and among the lowest of all 54 electric providers in the State of Florida. Earlier this month, the typical FPL residential customer bill decreased by nearly $4 or roughly 4%.  FPL had continued success with its cost savings initiatives, reducing its already best-in-class dollar per retail megawatt hour non-fuel O&M costs by more than 5% year-over-year. These ongoing cost savings combined with the flexibility afforded by FPL’s current settlement agreement enabled FPL to avoid a customer surcharge for the roughly $260 million of storm restoration costs related to Hurricane Dorian.  In addition to low bills, FPL delivered its best-ever service reliability performance in 2019 and was recognized for the fourth time in five years as being the most reliable electric utility in the nation. Finally, last quarter we were pleased that following an extensive and thorough 18-month review, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission granted Turkey Point Units 3 and 4 their second 20-year license extensions. These units are the first nuclear power plants in the United States to achieve this milestone, and this decision supports the continued production of clean, zero emission, reliable, and affordable nuclear power in Florida for many years to come. Beyond executing on its strategic initiatives, during 2019 FPL positioned itself well for continued long term growth. Early in the year, FPL announced its groundbreaking 30 by 30 plan, which is one of the world’s largest solar expansions and will result in roughly 10,000 megawatts of incremental solar capacity on FPL’s system. This solar expansion combined with low cost battery storage solutions, such as the Manatee Energy Storage Center that was announced during 2019 represent the next phase of FPL’s generation modernization efforts and are expected to further reduce FPL’s CO2 emissions rates, which is already among the lowest in the nation and has declined more than 30% since 2005. In addition to the terrific progress in generation, during the year, Florida passed the Public Utility Storm Protection Plans law that allows for clause recovery of storm hardening investments, including undergrounding. This new law supports continued hardening of FPL’s already storm-resilient energy grid and allows FPL to pursue these investments in a programmatic manner over the course of decades while deploying billions of dollars of incremental capital for the benefit of customers. We expect the final rules related to the new law to take effect later this quarter and that FPL will seek to begin clause recovery of its storm hardening investments beginning in 2021. With terrific visibility into significant investment programs such as these, we remain as confident as ever about FPL’s ability to sustain its long-term growth trajectory while further improving our customers’ value proposition. The Energy Resources team also continued its long track record of strong execution in 2019. The renewables origination success remained particularly strong with the team adding more than 5,800 megawatts to our backlog over the past year as we continue operating in what we believe to be the best renewables development environment in our history. Our ongoing renewables origination success results from our ability to leverage Energy Resources’ competitive advantages, including our best-in-class development skills, large pipeline of sites and interconnection queue positions, strong customer relationships, purchasing power, best-in-class construction expertise, resource assessment capabilities, strong access to and cost of capital advantages, and world-class operations capability. More than 50% of the solar megawatts that were added to our backlog in 2019 included a battery storage component, and the current backlog has more than 2,000 megawatts of trifecta projects that combined wind, solar, and battery storage together.  We also increasingly see storage as an important standalone business in its own right as we were reviewing a number of opportunities to add storage to our existing solar sites to take advantage of the ITC and enhance the value of our existing projects for customers. This highlights the rapid transition to the next phase of renewables development that pairs low-cost wind and solar energy with a low-cost battery storage solution as well as Energy Resources’ unique skills to combine the three technologies into integrated, near firm, low cost products. Energy Resources’ significant competitive advantages position it well to capitalize on the enormous disruption that is occurring to the nation’s generation fleet. We continue to expect that by the middle of this decade, without incentives, new near firm wind is going to be a $20 to $30 per megawatt hour product, and new near firm solar is going to be a $30 to $40 per megawatt hour product. At these prices, new near firm renewables will be cheaper than the operating costs of most existing coal, nuclear, and less efficient oil and gas-fired generation units. We were pleased by the 60% PTC extension that was passed in 2019, and we expect that it will support incremental wind demand in 2023 and 2024.  Our confidence in renewables being the low-cost generation alternative in the middle of this decade remains stronger than ever. We expect the disruptive nature of renewables to be terrific for customers, terrific for the environment, and terrific for shareholders by helping to drive tremendous growth for this company over the next decade. Let me now turn to Gulf Power and highlight how we executed in 2019 against some of the long term objectives that we outlined last year. As we’ve often discussed, two of the key hallmarks of the NextEra Energy playbook are reduced operating costs and using those savings to fund smart capital investments for our customers. After one year of ownership, we are well on our way to executing this strategy at Gulf Power. In 2019, we reduced Gulf Power’s O&M costs by approximately 20% year-over-year. In addition to lowering costs, we’ve also identified smart investment opportunities to benefit customers. In 2019, Gulf Power invested approximately $730 million, or roughly 2.5 times Gulf Power’s average capital investment amount over the past five years, and was able to regulatory capital employed at roughly 11% year-over-year.  Beyond realizing operating efficiencies and deploying smart capital, in the past year Gulf Power was able to meaningfully improve its customer value proposition. Gulf Power achieved its best ever service reliability year, which was approximately 20% better than its 2018 results. Customer service was also better with notable improvements in speed of answer and Florida Public Service Commission complaints.  There is nothing more important in our company than the safety of our employees. We made significant improvements in this area in 2019 as well with an approximately 40% reduction in our OSHA rate at Gulf Power versus 2018.  As the major capital investments that we advanced during 2019 come into service in 2020 and beyond, they will help achieve the other key objectives that we have outlined at Gulf Power, such as meaningful emissions reductions and, perhaps most importantly, a significant reduction in customer bills in real terms.  In addition to creating tremendous customer value, we expect that execution of the plans we’ve laid out at Gulf Power will also generate great outcomes for our shareholders as well. In our first year of ownership, Gulf Power’s adjusted earnings increase by 25% year-over-year. This outcome was even better than our plan at the start of the year and positions us well to deliver on the financial growth objectives that we outlined when we announced the acquisition. This high level performance across the board would not have been possible without the hard work and commitment of all Gulf Power employees.  While we are pleased with the results that we’ve achieved at Gulf Power during 2019, we remain focused on the significant execution ahead of us here to deliver even greater value to our customers and our shareholders.  Finally, we were once again honored to be named for the 13th time in 14 years number one in the electric and gas utilities industry on Fortune’s list of Most Admired Companies, as well as ranked among the top ten companies worldwide across all industries for social responsibility. During 2019 alone, NextEra Energy made approximately $13 billion in capital investments in American energy infrastructure, making us one of the top capital investors in the U.S. in any industry.  None of these recognitions nor our track record of success would be possible without the hard work and commitment to excellence of our people, who live our core value of doing the right thing every day. In the last year, there has been an increasing focus on ESG on the part of many of our stakeholders. The fact is our company has been focused on all of the elements of ESG for more than 25 years. We are proud of our track record here, but there is still so much more to do in this country to decarbonizes the electric transportation and industrial sectors. NextEra Energy is living proof that you can be clean and low cost and financially successful all at the same time. We will be at the vanguard of building a sustainable energy era that is both clean and affordable, and we are driving very hard to continue to be at the forefront of the disruption that is occurring within the energy sector. We expect that the execution of our strategy will drive meaningful CO2 emissions reductions across the country while simultaneously lowering generation costs for customers, and our continued investments in clean energy will help advance NextEra Energy towards its goal of reducing its CO2 emissions rate by 67% by 2025 from a 2005 baseline.  In summary, I continue to remain as enthusiastic as ever about NextEra Energy’s long term growth prospects. In 2019, we extended our long term track record of executing for the benefit of customers and shareholders and further developed our best-in-class organic growth prospects. Based on the strength and diversity of our underlying businesses, I will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted earnings per share expectation ranges in 2020, 2021 and 2022 while at the same time maintaining our strong credit ratings. We remain intensely focused on execution and continuing to drive shareholder value over the coming years.  Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners, which also had a terrific year of execution in 2019. In the more than five years since the IPO, NextEra Energy Partners has consistently delivered on its commitments. That history of execution is supported by NextEra Energy Partners’ outstanding portfolio of clean energy assets which grew significantly and was further diversified in 2019. During the year, NextEra Energy Partners acquired a portfolio of more than 600 megawatts of wind and solar assets from Energy Resources. Additionally during the fourth quarter, NextEra Energy Partners closed on the acquisition of Meade Pipeline Company, which owns an approximately 40% aggregate interest in Central Penn Line, an interstate natural gas pipeline in Pennsylvania that is backed by a minimum 14-year contract with a high credit quality customer and no volumetric risk.  Finally, during the year NextEra Energy Partners advanced an additional organic growth opportunity, announcing the repowering of 275 megawatts of wind projects. We are proud that 2019 is the first year that NextEra Energy Partners successfully executed on all of the three ways it can grow: organically, acquiring assets from third parties, and acquiring assets from Energy Resources’ portfolio, highlighting the clear flexibility and visibility into growth going forward. To support the ongoing growth investments and optimize the capitals structure for the benefit of LP unit holders, NextEra Energy Partners completed a number of financings and refinancings in 2019 as well. At the start of the year, NextEra Energy Partners faced headwinds related to the PG&E bankruptcy. The team immediately focused on managing and mitigating the negative impacts of this event, and we ended 2019 having favorably addressed many of the challenges. The Energy Resources portfolio acquisition and associated financing that we announced last March allowed NextEra Energy Partners to complete its original 2019 growth objectives, even after excluding PG&E related project cash flows. During the year, NextEra Energy Partners also purchased all of the outstanding holding company and operating company notes at our Genesis project. In addition to resulting in an increase in run rate cash available for distribution through the removal of project-level debt service, as a result of the purchase of the debt NextEra Energy Partners received approximately $128 million of distributions that had been or were expected to be restricted at the project. The release of this cash was used to partially fund the debt repurchase. I remain confident about a long term favorable resolution for our PG&E related assets. In addition to growing LP distributions by 15% year-over-year and achieving a run rate adjusted EBITDA range in excess of what was originally expected, NextEra Energy Partners’ year-end 2019 run rate cash available for distribution expectations, assuming full contributions from PG&E related projects, represents approximately 60% growth from the comparable year-end 2018 run rate range. With this strong year-over-year growth and cash available for distribution, NextEra Energy Partners expects to be able to achieve its long term distribution growth expectations without the need for additional asset acquisitions until 2021. As of year-end 2020, we expect to have achieved NextEra Energy Partners’ distribution growth objectives while maintaining a trailing 12-month payout ratio in the mid-70s range even after excluding cash distributions from our Desert Sunlight projects.  NEP delivered an attractive total unit holder return of approximately 28% in 2019, further advancing its history of value creation since the IPO. I continue to believe that the combination of NEP’s clean energy portfolio, growth visibility, and flexibility to finance that growth offer LP unit holders an attractive investor value proposition. As with NextEra Energy, we remain focused on continuing to execute in delivering that unit holder value over the coming years. I’ll now turn the call over to Rebecca, who will review the 2019 results in more detail.
Rebecca Kujawa: Thank you Jim, and good morning everyone. Let’s now turn to the detailed results, beginning with FPL. For the fourth quarter of 2019, FPL reported net income of $400 million or $0.81 per share, down $0.04 per share year over year. For the full year 2019, FPL reported net income of $2.33 billion or $4.81 per share, an increase of $0.26 per share versus 2018. Regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 8.3% for 2019 and was the principal driver of FPL’s net income growth of roughly 8% for the full year. During the fourth quarter, growth from new investments was offset by a number of factors, including a contribution to our charitable foundation that should fund its operations for the next several years. FPL’s capital expenditures were approximately$2 billion in the fourth quarter, bringing its full-year capital investments to a total of roughly $5.8 billion. FPL’s reported ROE for regulatory purposes was 11.6% for the 12 months ending December 31, 2019, which is at the upper end of the allowed band of 9.6% to 11.6% under our current rate agreement. During the fourth quarter, we utilized a total of $18 million of reserve amortization, including the approximately $260 million that was utilized to offset Hurricane Dorian storm restoration costs, leaving FPL with a year-end 2019 balance of $893 million.  We continue to expect that FPL will end 2020 with a sufficient amount of reserve amortization to operate under the current base rate settlement agreement for one additional year, and as a result expect to file a base rate case in the first quarter of 2021 for new rates that are effective in January of 2022. While we have not made a final decision, based on our review we expect that the merging of FPL and Gulf Power and making a single rate case filing will result in customer benefits, and we therefore see this as a likely approach for the filing at this time. All of our major capital projects at FPL are progressing well. The 10 solar sites totaling nearly 750 megawatts of combined capacity that are currently being built across FPL’s service territory are all on track and on budget to begin providing cost effective energy to FPL customers in early 2020. To support the significant solar expansion that FPL is leading across Florida, we have secured sites that could support 10 gigawatts of future projects.  Earlier this month, the Florida Public Service Commission held hearings on FPL’s proposed Solar Together program. We continue to expect a decision about the proposed program at the end of the first quarter. Beyond solar, construction on a highly efficient, roughly 1,200 megawatt Dania Beach clean energy centre remains on schedule and on budget as it continues to advance towards its projected commercial operations date in 2022. We continue to expect that FPL’s ongoing smart investment opportunities will support a compound annual growth rate of regulatory capital employed of approximately 9% from 2018 through 2022 while further enhancing our best-in-class customer value proposition. Let me now turn to Gulf Power, which reported fourth quarter 2019 GAAP and adjusted earnings of $23 million and $26 million respectively, or $0.05 per share. For the full year, Gulf Power reported GAAP earnings of $180 million or $0.37 per share and adjusted earnings of $200 million or $0.41 per share. As a reminder, during the first 12 months following the closing of the acquisition, we excluded one-time acquisition integration costs from adjusted earnings. Additionally, interest expense to finance the acquisition is reflected in corporate and other. Gulf Power’s reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 10.8% for the 12 months ending December 2019, which is in the upper half of the allowed band of 9.25% to 11.25% under its current rate agreement. For the full year 2020, we expect to target a regulatory ROE near the upper end of this allowed band, assuming normal weather and operating conditions. As Jim discussed, the overall execution of Gulf Power’s capital program is advancing well. Gulf Power’s first solar development project, the roughly 75 megawatt Blue Indigo solar energy center is expected to go into service later this quarter and generate significant customer savings over its lifetime. All the other major capital investments, including the North Florida Resiliency Connection and the Plant Crist coal to natural gas conversion, continue to remain on track. The Florida economy remains healthy as Florida’s population continues to grow at one of the fastest rates in the nation. According to recent IRS data, Florida attracted a net gain of roughly $16 billion in personal taxable income in 2018, by far the highest of any state in the country and the fastest rate of growth as well, which is a reflection of the attraction of Florida’s low tax, pro-business policies. Florida’s most recent seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 3.1%, below the national average and at the lowest level in a decade. Florida has now added nearly 2 million private sector jobs over the last 10 years.  Leading indicators in the real estate sector have remained at a stable pace, reflecting continued strength of the Florida housing market. Other positive economic data across the state include continued strength in retail taxable sales as well as the consumer confidence index, which remains near 10-year highs. During the quarter, FPL’s average number of customers increased by approximately 100,000 from the comparable prior year quarter, driven by continued solid underlying growth and the addition of Vero Beach’s roughly 35,000 customers late last year. For 2019, FPL’s retail sales increased 1.7% from the prior year, driven primarily by a favorable weather comparison.  On a weather normalized basis, FPL’s retail sales declined by 0.6% as customer growth was more than offset by a reduction in underlying usage per customer. The decline in underlying usage was a reversal from the trend that FPL experienced in 2018 when underlying usage increased by 1.7%. As we’ve previously noted, usage per customer tends to exhibit significant volatility which can be more pronounced during periods of particularly strong weather conditions, similar to those experienced during 2019, which makes distinguishing between underlying usage changes and weather impacts challenging. For Gulf Power, the average number of customers increased slightly versus the comparable prior year quarter as it moves beyond the impacts of Hurricane Michael in 2018. For 2019, Gulf Power’s retail sales declined slightly due to unfavorable weather and a small decline in underlying usage per customer. Let me now turn to Energy Resources, beginning with a reporting change in our segments. Given the Trans Bay Cable acquisition during 2019, we have reevaluated our operating segments and made a change to reflect the overall scale of our competitive transmission business and the management of these projects within our company. Our reporting for Energy Resources now includes the results of our NextEra Energy Transmission projects, formerly reported in corporate and other segment. Our 2018 results have been adjusted accordingly for comparison purposes, resulting in an increase in Energy Resources’ full year 2018 adjusted EPS of $0.09 per share. Incorporating the reporting change, Energy Resources reported fourth quarter 2019 GAAP earnings of $433 million or $0.88 per share. Adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter were $326 million or $0.66 per share. Energy Resources’ contributions to adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter decreased $0.01 versus the prior year comparable period as strong underlying growth from new and existing investments was more than offset by a number of items, including the negative $0.14 adjusted EPS impact of our refinancing activities which were primarily related to financing breakage costs associated with several wind repowerings as well as Energy Resources’ share of costs associated with the acquisition of the outstanding Genesis debt. As a reminder, while these refinancing activities created a reduction in fourth quarter adjusted earnings, they are expected to translate to favorable net income contributions in future years and an overall improvement in net present value for our shareholders. For the full year, Energy Resources reported GAAP earnings of $1.81 billion or $3.72 per share, and adjusted earnings of $1.7 billion or $3.49 per share. Energy Resources’ full year adjusted earnings per share contribution increased $0.35 or approximately 11% versus 2018. For the full year, growth was driven by continued additions to our renewables portfolio as contributions from new investments increased by $0.55 per share. Contributions from our gas infrastructure business, including existing pipelines, increased by $0.13 versus the prior year. Also contributing favorably were the customer supply and trading business, where contributions increased by $0.05 versus 2018, and NextEra Energy Transmission, which increased results $0.04 year-over-year primarily as a result of the Trans Bay Cable acquisition that closed in the middle of 2019. These favorable results were partially offset by higher interest expense, reflecting the negative $0.14 adjusted EPS impact in the fourth quarter of refinancing activities as well as growth in the business and lower contributions from the existing generation assets.  In 2019, wind resource was 96% of the long term average, down from 97% a year earlier. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide. In 2019, Energy Resources continued to advance its position as the leading developer and operator of wind, solar and battery storage projects, commissioning approximately 2,700 megawatts of renewables projects in the U.S, including repowering. Since the last call, we have added 1,609 megawatts of renewables projects to our backlog, including approximately 500 megawatts of combined new wind and repowering, 700 megawatts of solar, and 340 megawatts of battery storage, all of which will be paired with new solar projects. Energy Resources has now placed a total of approximately 3,700 megawatts of repowering projects in service since 2017, which represents approximately one-third of its operating wind portfolio as of year-end 2016. We expect that by the end of 2020, more than 60% of Energy Resources’ operating wind projects will have been originally recommissioned or repowered within the last five years, highlighting the young age of the overall fleet and the expected long date future value creation of the portfolio.  Following the terrific origination year in 2019 and with nearly three years remaining in the period, we are now within the 2019 to 2022 renewables development ranges that we introduced in the middle of last year. For the post-2022 period, our backlog is already more than 2,400 megawatts, placing us far ahead of our historical origination activity at this early stage. The accompanying slide provides additional detail on where our renewables development program now stands. Beyond renewables, as of year-end 2019 the Mountain Valley pipeline was approximately 90% complete. We have been working with our project partners to resolve all of the outstanding permit issues for the pipeline and we continue to make good progress on these efforts. We expect that the issues related to MVP’s biological opinion and Nationwide 12 permit will be resolved in the spring, allowing construction work along much of the route to resume. We also remain hopeful that the Supreme Court will overturn the Fourth Circuit Court’s original decision on Atlantic Coast Pipeline’s case related to its Appalachian Trail Crossing authorization, resolving similar challenges for MVP. We continue to target a full in-service date for the pipeline during 2020 and an overall project cost estimate of approximately $5.4 billion.  Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy, for the fourth quarter of 2019, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $975 million or $1.99 per share. NextEra Energy’s fourth quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $706 million or $1.44 per share respectively. For the full year 2019, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $3.77 billion or $7.76 per share. Adjusted earnings were $4.06 billion or $8.37 per share. For the corporate and other segment, adjusted earnings for the full year decreased $0.35 per share compared to the 2018 prior comparable period, primarily as a result of higher interest expense related to the Gulf Power acquisition financing. NextEra Energy also delivered strong operating cash flow growth which increased at a faster rate than the adjusted EPS growth rate.  As expected, during 2019 we also maintained our strong credit position. Based on the S&P methodology, we estimate that we ended the year at a 22.5% FFO to debt level versus our current downgrade threshold of 21%. For Moody’s, we expect 2019 CFO pre-working capital to debt was 19.6% versus our current downgrade threshold of 18%. NextEra Energy’s cushion versus our credit metrics reflects the continued strength of our balance sheet and supports the record roughly $14 billion of capital investments that we expect to make in 2020.  The financial expectations that we extended last year through 2022 remain unchanged. We continue to expect that NextEra Energy’s adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate to be in a range of 6% to 8% through 2021 off of the 2018 adjusted EPS of $7.70, plus the accretion of $0.15 and $0.20 in 2020 and 2021 respectively from the Florida acquisitions. For 2020, we continue to expect our adjusted EPS to be in the range of $8.70 to $9.20, and as Jim highlighted, we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of this range. This year, we do expect that our adjusted EPS growth will be more weighted towards the second half of the year. For 2022, we expect to grow adjusted EPS in the range of 6% to 8% off 2021 adjusted EPS, translating to a range of $10 to $10.75 per share. From 2018 to 2022, we continue to expect that operating cash flow will grow roughly in line with our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. As always, all of our expectations are subject to the usual caveats, including but not limited to normal weather and operating conditions. Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners, which also had a strong year of operational and financial performance in 2019. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $280 million and cash available for distribution was $101 million, an increase of 70% and 130% respectively. The strong growth was driven primarily by the significant year-over-year growth in NextEra Energy Partners’ portfolio, including the 2019 acquisitions of the Energy Resources’ assets and the Meade Pipeline Company, as well as a full quarter’s contribution from the portfolio of projects that were acquired in late 2018.  For the full year 2019, adjusted EBITDA was $1.1 billion, up 25% year-over-year. Cash available for distribution, excluding all contributions from our Desert Sunlight projects, was $366 million, an increase of 8% from the prior year. Including full contributions from the Desert Sunlight projects, NextEra Energy Partners achieved CAFD growth 20% versus 2018.  Similar to the quarterly results, full-year growth in both adjusted EBITDA and CAFD was primarily driven by portfolio growth. The benefit from new projects was partially offset by the divestiture of Canadian assets during 2018. Cash available for distribution was also reduced by higher corporate level interest expense. As a reminder, these results include the impact of IDR fees, which we treat as an operating expense. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide.  Yesterday the NextEra Energy Partners board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.535 per common unit or $2.14 per unit on an annualized basis, up 15% from the comparable quarterly distribution a year earlier and at the top end of the range we discussed going into 2019.  As Jim mentioned, during 2019 NextEra Energy Partners executed several financings for the benefit of LP unit holders. In addition to raising approximately $1.2 billion of unsecured holding company notes which priced at some of the lowest spreads ever in the sector, NextEra Energy Partners also raised $1.4 billion of low-cost project finance debt and executed a $1.3 billion revolver extension. NextEra Energy Partners also raised $1.8 billion through three convertible equity portfolio financings. With low initial coupons, the convertible equity portfolio financings provide more cash to LP unit holders, allowing NextEra Energy Partners to acquire fewer assets to achieve the same level of future distribution growth which will also, as a result, lower future financing needs.  In addition to reduced future asset and equity needs, these financings provide NextEra Energy Partners the flexibility to convert into common units at no discount over a long period of time. This should be accretive to LP unit holders who retain all of the unit price upside as NextEra Energy Partners executes on its expected distribution growth objectives. These attributes combined with the significant flexibility that NextEra Energy Partners retains with the financings, including the timing of conversion, option to convert at any price, option to pay the buyout in cash rather units, and the option to deploy the buyout amount into other assets should generate significant value to LP unit holders while also providing significant downside protection.  Finally, last quarter following the achievement of certain NextEra Energy Partners units trading thresholds, we converted the second tranche of the convertible preferred securities that we issued in 2017 into an additional roughly 4.7 million NextEra Energy Partners common units, further supporting our ongoing goal of using low-cost financing products to layer in equity over time.  The NextEra Energy Partners portfolio at year-end 2019 supports the revised adjusted EBITDA and CAFD December 31, 2019 run rate expectations that we announced at the time of the Meade acquisition. Since NextEra Energy Partners long-term distribution growth expectations are supported without the need of additional asset acquisitions until 2021, the December 31, 2020 run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA and CAFD remain unchanged, at the same levels as the year-end 2019 run rate expectations. Including full contributions from PG&E-related projects, year-end 2020 run rate cash available for distribution is expected to be in a range of $560 million to $640 million, reflecting calendar year 2021 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at the end of 2020 and assuming normal weather and operating conditions. Excluding all contributions from the Desert Sunlight projects, NextEra Energy Partners continues to expect a year-end 2020 run rate for CAFD in the range of $505 million to $585 million.  Year-end 2020 run rate adjusted EBITDA expectations, which assume full contributions from PG&E-related projects as revenue is expected to continue to be recognized, are $1.225 billion to $1.4 billion. As a reminder, all of our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and include the impact of anticipated IDR fees, as we treat these as an operating expense.  From an updated base of our fourth quarter 2019 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $2.14, we continue to see 12% to 15% growth per year in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2024. We expect that the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2020 distribution that is payable in February 2021 to be in a range of $2.40 to $2.46 per common unit.  In summary, we continue to believe that both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners have excellent prospects for growth. FPL, Gulf Power, Energy Resources and NextEra Energy Partners each have an outstanding set of opportunities across the board. The progress we made in 2019 reinforces our long term growth prospects, and while we have a lot to execute on in 2020, we believe that we have the building blocks in place for another excellent year.  That concludes our prepared remarks, and with that we will open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator instructions] Our first question today comes from Greg Gordon from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead with your question.
Greg Gordon: Thanks. Congratulations on another very, very consistent year performance.
Rebecca Kujawa: Thanks Greg, good morning.
Greg Gordon: A couple questions for you. Based on my back of the envelope math, it doesn’t look like you’ve earned the maximum allowable ROE at Florida Power & Light this year. Can you tell us where you landed on a return on equity basis for fiscal year ’19?
Rebecca Kujawa: Yes Greg, from a reported regulatory ROE standpoint, so what ultimately goes to the Florida Public Service Commission, we did earn the 11.6% ROE as allowed under our settlement agreement. You are right - we did have some below the line expenses, which is typical, but those below the line expenses are excluded from that regulatory ROE calculation.
Greg Gordon: Got you, understood. And then when you point out in your slide deck that the majority of your PTCs are now being allocated through tax equity, there’s a very clear slide in the appendix on that. That means that we should be looking at NCI on the balance sheet flowing through the income statement as the way that that’s flowing through earnings now, is that correct?
Rebecca Kujawa: Yes, that’s correct.
Greg Gordon: Okay, and the average amortization of a tax equity deal for a wind project is approximately 10 years, is that right?
Rebecca Kujawa: Yes, the earnings recognition is roughly coincident with the 10-year PTC range for all of our wind projects that are in PTCs.
Greg Gordon: Right, and for a solar deal, it would be slightly faster?
Rebecca Kujawa: Yes, it typically relates to the recognition of the ITC period, so for many tax equity structures, that’s over five years. Certain tax equity partners prefer a seven-year structure, and so then it would be over seven years as opposed to five.
Greg Gordon: Right. As you guys gear up for preparing for the rate case in 2021, are there any milestones this year or will the majority of the activity be happening in early ’21?
Rebecca Kujawa: Well as you certainly appreciate, there’s a ton of milestones that are largely internal for our teams as they get ready for any rate proceeding, and many of those preparation efforts started well before this year and are ongoing, and we have the incremental work this year of doing all the analysis of thinking about bringing FPL and Gulf together. But as I highlighted in the prepared remarks, based on what we know today, our expectation is that we would file a rate case in early ’21 for the new rates effective in 2022, and you know the first start of that would be the filing of the test year letter, which we would expect to file in early ’21.
Greg Gordon: Great. My last question is the battery storage backlog is obviously continuing to ramp. Are you buying battery storage--are you buying the product from another vendor or are you buying the components from different OEMs and building your own bespoke battery storage product? In other words, are you using a vendor like Fluence or one of the other total product companies, or are you sourcing components and building your own battery units?
Rebecca Kujawa: It’s much more the latter, Greg. We see a tremendous amount of value and are being able to have some nimbleness in where we procure the battery packs, but then we also are procuring separately, as you suggested, things like the containers and the other equipment that you would ultimately use to assemble the battery facility. And then also we’re designing our own management systems. We ultimately believe that some of the real value add that we’re going to be able to add to customers, that will likely differentiate us from others is that battery system management because we’ve talked about with you guys and with others over time that there’s probably not one value stream that creates the value for batteries, it’s usually a couple of different applications within the same system, and that management system and optimizing that is going to be part of the secret sauce of batteries.  We’ve invested a lot of time and energy in thinking through that not only on the Energy Resources deployments but also for the deployments that we’ve had at FPL, and we’re learned a tremendous amount and we’re really excited as we highlighted in the prepared remarks about batteries as a terrific supplement to further renewable deployment certainly in the middle part of the next decade and thereafter as renewables become a significant component of the generation stack in U.S. power markets. 
Greg Gordon: Thanks a lot.
Rebecca Kujawa: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead with your question.
Steve Fleishman: Yes, hi. Good morning. Just a question first if you could update us on the Santee Cooper situation and your interest there; and then secondly, with JEA now gone and stock obviously doing very well, just kind of overall thought process on M&A strategy and opportunities right now. Thanks.
James Robo: Steve, this is Jim. I’ll take that. Obviously, we’re pretty limited in what we can say about the Santee Cooper situation other than what I’ve said previously, which is we remain very interested in Santee Cooper and we think South Carolina is a terrific place to do business, and that’s probably all I can say about that. On the JEA front, I would say we’re disappointed that the sale process has been terminated. We think we could have brought enormous value to the customers and the citizens of Jacksonville, and we think it’s unfortunate that it’s been terminated, but that is what it is. In terms of future M&A activity, I will repeat what I’ve been pretty consistent in terms of what our strategy is on that front, which is in terms of what we like, we have been very focused. First of all, I don’t think there’s a utility in the country that wouldn’t benefit from the application of our playbook. That said, we have been focused on opportunities in the southeast, in the midwest, as well as FERC regulated opportunities. Those are, from a regulatory standpoint and other opportunities, what we think are the best fit for us and that remains our focus. We continue to be very interested in trying to do something. That said, M&A is always hard and there are a lot of hurdles to get over, and we will, as always, be extraordinarily financially disciplined. You will never see us announce a deal that we say is strategic and has no accretion, so anything that we do will have significant accretion associated with it. So, I think that’s probably the sum total of what I can say on that. 
Steve Fleishman: Okay. One quick technical question. Is there a quick and easy way you can quantify the balance sheet capacity available for these FFO to debt metrics at Moody’s and S&P in terms of dollars?
Rebecca Kujawa: Yes, we’re probably not going to quantify it exactly, Steve. As you’ve heard us say quite a number of times over the years, a strong balance sheet is incredibly important to us. We clearly have some room from our downgrade thresholds, which is certainly terrific and is important to us as we think about how do we make sure that we’re prepared for making investments that we want to make in the future, including especially this year, setting aside the comments that Jim just made on M&A, just for our organic growth prospects alone we have $14 billion of planned capital investment in our business, and having a strong balance sheet as we start to make those investments is incredibly important. 
Steve Fleishman: Great, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Good morning, can you hear me?
Rebecca Kujawa: Good morning, we can hear you just fine.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. Thanks again for all the commentary. Perhaps kicking if off on the retiring front, would just be curious on your thoughts on the ’24 opportunity now, given the PTC extension. How does that shift your thinking and logic around incremental repowering? I know you provided already some fairly detailed remarks on repowering already, but I want to dig in on that specific opportunity especially given that that’s a year already after the timeline for the solar ITC here, if you can elaborate.
Rebecca Kujawa: Sure, of course. As we highlighted in our development expectations that we laid out this summer for the 2019 through 2022 time frame, you’ll note that the repowering opportunities that we saw were heavily, and at that time exclusively in the 2019 to 2020 time frame, and we’ve continued to work on opportunities to repower assets at both an 80% PTC and a 60% PTC, so first we’ll focus in the 80% before we even think about the extensions of anything that’s possible in 60%.  Remember, there’s always a trade-off in making these investment opportunities. Part of the economic value of that is getting the new set of PTCs, and so there’s a balance of the cost of the investment that you need to make in that equipment and also ensuring that you can meet the IRS test of the 80/20 valuation, and as the PTC value goes down, it gets a little bit harder to justify both of those requirements. Again, we thought it was a terrific program, created a huge amount of shareholder value, really highlights the option value embedded in our portfolio, and we’ll continue to be creative and work towards creating more opportunities like that or things that are analogous to it in the future.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it, excellent. Just clarifying the last question a little bit, you mentioned FERC regulated opportunities. Jim, can you elaborate a little bit further on the thought process there? Obviously this transmission ROE question has been lingering across the sector. I just want to make sure we heard you right as to how you’re thinking about the various FERC asset classes. 
James Robo: Yes, so obviously we did the Trans Bay acquisition, that’s not in the midwest or the southeast, and we do on a long term basis like FERC regulated assets, notwithstanding the recent ROE decision on the MISO transmission owners.  Listen - I think there’s been--you know, obviously that’s an open docket at FERC right now. I probably can’t comment on what I think the outcomes are going to be there, other than to say I do believe FERC regulation will be constructive in the long term, and we think in the long term it’s a good place for us to deploy capital.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Maybe Jim, if I can, one more quickly on ESG. As you think about establishing targets and becoming, perhaps, more prescriptive and being a leader on this front, how do you think about being more specific on carbon? I know this comes up a little bit, but I’m curious on the thought process there. I know it’s also complicated, too. 
James Robo: Sure. I think we have been pretty specific about what our 2025 goal is, which is--remember, all of these discussions are about percent reductions. We started at an enormously lower level than the rest of the industry on just base CO2 emissions per megawatt hour generated, so any of the goals that we lay out, which our goal is a 67% reduction off our 2005 base by 2025, I think if you went back and you looked at the 2005 U.S. average and compared our NextEra rate in 2025 to that 2005 average, I’m going to give you a number and everyone is going to go check me on it, that would be an 85% or 90% reduction relative to the 2005 U.S. average CO2 emissions rate.  We are going to significantly decarbonize our company and our emissions, and I’m really excited about the goals we’ve set. I think they are very doable, and what I’m most excited about is the role that we can play both in Florida and in the rest of the country in terms of leading the way to decarbonize not just the electric sector but the transportation sector.  There’s lots more to do, as I said in my prepared remarks. I think the country has a lot more to do, and the great news for the country and the economy is you can be clean and low cost at the same time, and whatever we do will be for the benefit of the customers and it will drive good economics, better GDP growth for the country, lower costs, and obviously a better environmental profile. 
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Thanks for the time. I appreciate it. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Shahriar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead with your question.
Shahriar Pourreza: Hey, good morning guys. Just on the near backlog, it’s obviously very strong again, so I’m just trying to get a sense, Rebecca, on how much of that backlog increase, mainly on the wind side, was attributed to a pull forward of projects with the modest PTC extension versus actual incremental opportunities you’re seeing as we think about modeling forward.
Rebecca Kujawa: Yes, I don’t think it’s very much. I think it’s early--obviously the PTC extension happened very, very late in 2019, so I don’t think we’ve seen any impacts from it whatsoever, coupled with the fact that it’s quite a number of years down the road. It doesn’t affect the profile of the PTC in the next three years, which is really what was driving a lot of our customers’ actions.  In terms of overall demand and how that’s reflected, as we’ve said in the past, we thought 2020 was going to be a significant development year - clearly it is for wind, and that 2021 is more likely than not to be roughly comparable with where we were in 2019, and we continue to see really strong interest from our customers about wind in the long term, as they should be. As Jim highlighted, the cost of wind and solar projects out in the mid-2020s, assuming there are not any meaningful extensions of the incentives, which is an assumption at this point that should be checked, but assuming those incentives are not extended, are very competitive versus existing coal and nuclear plants and some less efficient gas-fired plants, so economics should continue to drive decisions for our customers for many, many years to come.
Shahriar Pourreza: Got it. Then just lastly, thanks for the incremental disclosures around Gulf. Is there anything you can maybe provide directionally on the base assumptions you’re assuming in ’22 as we’re thinking about your EPS guidance, i.e. maybe from a regulatory construct or even addition to spending opportunities, like the extension of SoBRA. Is there anything you can provide directionally on how you’re thinking about this?
Rebecca Kujawa: Not much beyond what we’ve already talked about in terms of everything that’s built into our expectations for 2020 through 2022, and as you recall from the investor conference materials, we did lay out a lot of the details for both businesses through 2021, and of course more detail for Energy Resources out in ’22. But the fundamentals are very consistent with what we’ve been doing for a long time on the regulated businesses - again, focusing on good capital investment that adds value for our customers and taking cost out of the business to ensure that we have very thoughtful views on customer bills, and in the case of Gulf Power targeting a meaningful decline in the bills out to the mid-2020s. So keep doing what we’re doing, and we couldn’t be more excited about the growth opportunities for all of the businesses that lay out in front of us.
Shahriar Pourreza: Got it, so stay tuned around the cap structure and the reserve amortization and how you’re thinking about chewing up between the two utilities?
Rebecca Kujawa: Absolutely. 
Shahriar Pourreza: Okay, great. Congrats guys. 
Rebecca Kujawa: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Weinstein from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.
Unknown Analyst: Hi, just [indiscernible] on behalf of Mike. Thanks for taking the questions. Just a check on the battery growth you’re talking about, can you talk about these reductions you’re seeing on the battery systems for the projects in the pipe, and would it be possible to quantify the scale of opportunity for retrofits on existing sites, either at NEER or at NEP?
Rebecca Kujawa: In terms of battery cost, we’ve laid out some of our thoughts and expectations, I think most recently in our EEI investor presentation. We haven’t broken out a lot of the detail between battery back and the rest of the balance of system costs, but everything that we’ve laid out in terms of where we’ve seen the market declines coming from in aggregate has really started to materialize, and whereas two years ago we were surprised at how much faster costs were coming down, we’ve gotten more aggressive with our assumptions and now they’re roughly consistent with what we were thinking.  We continue to be very optimistic longer term about batteries, and as the whole industry has talked about, it’s really not about the power sector. It’s being driven much more by the electric vehicle sector, and those drivers appear to be pretty clear for quite a number of years down the road, which is really driving the manufacturing efficiencies and scale that we’re seeing on a battery pack side. So really excited about optimistic about where that business is headed.
Unknown Analyst: Got it. Could you just comment on the retrofit opportunity for either NEER or NEP for batteries, and would it be possible to get the tax credits on adding storage to an existing solar project? 
Rebecca Kujawa: You know, it could obviously be a significant opportunity coincident with the significant deployment of [indiscernible] particularly where the penetration is high, adding batteries to existing solar sites could be very advantageous. To the extent that they’ve elected the ITC and ultimately are being used to charge the battery system, yes, they would qualify for ITCs as long as we meet certain conditions. It’s a terrific opportunity for the team, but it’s really consistent with what we’ve been thinking about for the overall market opportunity and what we’ve been highlighting for quite some time now to investors.
Unknown Analyst: Got it. Just one last question from me, if you could talk about the impact on interest rates on NEP’s ability to execute the convertible refinancings. Thank you.
Rebecca Kujawa: It’s been terrific. A low interest rate environment is obviously terrific for both of our businesses. We love low cost of capital to be able to deploy these solutions as economically as possible for both our customers on the Energy Resources side, as well as regulated utilities and of course also for NextEra Energy Partners. It’s been terrific.
Unknown Analyst: Thanks.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, with that we will conclude today’s question and answer session, as well as today’s conference. We do thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-10-22 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners Conference call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, today's event is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Matt Roskot, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Matthew Roskot: Thank you, Rocco. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter 2019 combined earnings conference call for NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. With me this morning are Jim Robo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; Rebecca Kujawa, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; John Ketchum, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources; and Mark Hickson, Executive Vice President of NextEra Energy, all of whom are also officers of NextEra Energy Partners; as well as Eric Silagy, President and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light Company. Rebecca will provide an overview of our results and our executive team will then be available to answer your questions. We will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release, in the comments made during this conference call, in the Risk Factors section of the accompanying presentation, or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found on our websites, nexteraenergy.com and nexteraenergypartners.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. Today's presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of historical non-GAAP measures to the closest GAAP financial measure. With that I will turn the call over to Rebecca.
Rebecca Kujawa: Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy delivered strong third quarter results, and building upon the solid progress made in the first half of the year, remains well positioned to achieve our overall objectives for 2019. NextEra Energy's third quarter adjusted earnings per share increased by $0.22, or approximately 10% against the prior year quarter, reflecting strong execution at Florida Power & Light, Gulf Power, and Energy Resources. Year-to-date we have grown adjusted earnings per share by nearly 12% compared to the prior-year comparable period. We continue to execute well on our major initiatives, including continuing to capitalize on one of the best renewable development periods in our history. At Florida Power & Light, earnings per share increased $0.03 year-over-year. All of our major capital projects, including one of the largest solar expansions ever in the United States remains on track as we continue to advance our long-term focus on delivering outstanding customer value. FPL's typical residential bill remains nearly 30% below the national average and the lowest among all of the Florida investor-owned utilities, while FPL maintains best-in-class service reliability and an emissions profile that is among the cleanest in the nation. At Gulf Power, we continue to execute on the cost reduction initiatives and smart capital investments that we outlined at our June investor conference. We remain focused on improving the Gulf Power customer value proposition by providing lower cost, higher reliability, and outstanding customer service and clean energy solutions. Along these lines, the Blue Indigo Solar project, which is Gulf Power's first solar development project, is expected to go in service in early 2020 and generate significant customer savings over its lifetime. At Energy Resources, adjusted EPS increased by roughly 19% year-over-year as contributions from new investments continued to drive growth. Continuing the success of recent quarters since the last earnings call, our renewables backlog increased by approximately 1,375 megawatts, including 350 MW of battery storage projects as we further advance the next phase of renewables deployment that pairs low-cost wind and solar energy with a low-cost battery storage solution. Overall with three strong quarters complete in 2019, we are pleased with the progress we are making at NextEra Energy and are well positioned to achieve the full-year financial expectations that we have previously discussed; of course, subject to our usual caveats. Now, let's look at the detailed results, beginning with FPL. For the third quarter of 2019, FPL reported net income of $683 million, or $1.40 per share, an increase of $29 million, or $0.03 per share, respectively, year over year. Regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 8% over the same quarter last year and was the principal driver of FPL's net income growth. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $1.4 billion in the third quarter, and we expect our full-year capital investments to total between $5.7 billion and $6.1 billion. Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be, approximately, 11.6% for the 12 months ending September 2019, which is at the upper end of the allowed band of 9.6% to 11.6% under our current rate agreement. During the quarter we restored $308 million of reserve amortization to achieve our target regulatory ROE, leaving FPL with a balance of $916 million. All of our major capital projects at FPL are progressing well. The 10 solar sites, totaling nearly 750 megawatts of combined capacity that are currently being built across FPL service territory, are all on track and on budget to begin providing cost-effective energy to FPL customers early in 2020. Earlier this month FPL and a number of interveners reached a settlement agreement for FPL's proposed Solar Together program, which now incorporates a 10% allocation of the residential capacity to low-income customers. We expect the Florida Public Service Commission to make a decision about the proposed program by the end of the first quarter of next year. All of the solar projects we are currently constructing are part of FPL's groundbreaking 30x30 plan to install more than 30 million solar panels by 2030, which will result in roughly 10,000 megawatts of incremental solar capacity on FPL system in Florida. The solar deployment will also help FPL achieve a 2030 CO2 emissions rate reduction target of 67% versus the 2005 US electric industry average. Beyond solar, construction on the highly-efficient roughly 200 megawatts Dania Beach Clean Energy Center continues to advance towards its projected commercial operation date in 2022. While Florida was fortunate to avoid significant harm and damage from Hurricane Dorian, residents of the Bahamas were severely impacted by the effects of this dangerous and deadly storm. Our deepest sympathies are with those who have been impacted by the storm's widespread destruction. As the storm approached the East Coast of the United States, Hurricane Dorian was forecast to make landfall within FPL's service territory as a major hurricane, which could have resulted in countless Floridians and an estimated 4 million FPL customers suffering extensive damage. In response to this threat and to ensure that we could quickly restore power to our customers should this devastating storm hit us, FPL followed its well-developed plan to respond to such an event, including pre-staging approximately 17,000 personnel. While FPL service territory was only hit by the strong outer bands of the storm, the hardening and automation investments that FPL has made since 2006 to build a stronger, smarter, and more storm-resilient energy grid helped FPL restore service to the approximately 160,000 customers who were impacted by Hurricane Dorian and to avoid additional outages. Although FPL has not completed the final accounting, our preliminary estimate of storm restoration costs, including pre-staging of personnel, is approximately $274 million. Under the terms of FPL's current settlement agreement, beginning 60 days following the filing of a cost recovery petition with the Florida Public Service Commission and subject to a review and prudence determination of the final storm costs, FPL is authorized to recover storm restoration costs on an interim basis from customers through a surcharge. Earlier this month, the Florida Public Service Commission issued proposed rules in response to the new law that allows for clause recovery of storm hardening investments, including undergrounding. This new law will allow FPL to pursue these investments in a programmatic basis over the course of decades, further strengthening FPL's storm resilient energy grid against future threats such as Hurricane Dorian. We expect that the final rules will be adopted next year. Let me now turn to Gulf Power, which is reporting third quarter 2019 GAAP and adjusted earnings of $76 million and $80 million, respectively, or $0.16 per share. As a reminder, during the first 12 months following the closing of the Gulf Power acquisition, we intend to exclude one-time acquisition integration costs from adjusted earnings. Additionally, interest expense to finance the acquisition is reflected in corporate and other and this expense offsets a significant portion of the third quarter Gulf Power adjusted earnings contribution. Gulf Power's reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 9.8% for the 12 months ending September 2019. For the full year 2019, we continue to target a regulatory ROE in the upper half of the allowed band of 9.25% to 11.25%. During the quarter, Gulf Power's capital expenditures were roughly $225 million. We continue to expect Gulf Power's full-year capital investments to total between $700 million and $800 million and the execution of its overall capital program is advancing well. All of these major capital investments, including the North Florida Resiliency Connection and Plant Crist coal to gas conversion continue to remain on track. The Florida economy remained strong. Florida's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 3.2% in September, below the national average and the lowest level in the last decade. As an indicator of new construction, building permits remain at healthy levels. The most recent reading of the Case-Shiller Index for South Florida shows home prices up 3.9% from the prior year. Overall, Florida's economy continues to grow with the latest readings of Florida's consumer confidence remaining strong. During the quarter, FPL's average number of customers increased by approximately 100,000 from the comparable prior-year quarter, driven by continued solid underlying growth and the addition of Vero Beach's roughly 35,000 customers late last year. FPL's third quarter retail sales increased 0.1% year-over-year. Partially offsetting customer growth was a decline in overall usage per customer of 1.6%, as favorable weather was more than offset by an estimated 3.9% decrease in weather normalized usage per customer, including a small decline in usage associated with Hurricane Dorian. As we previously noted, usage per customer tends to exhibit significant volatility from quarter to quarter, which can be more pronounced during periods of particularly warm weather conditions, similar to those experienced during the third quarter. For Gulf Power, the average number of customers was roughly flat to the comparable prior-year quarter. We are beginning to see recovery accelerate in the areas of the service territory that were most impacted by Hurricane Michael last year. Gulf Power's third quarter retail sales increased 2.3% year-over-year, primarily due to favorable weather. Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported third quarter 2019 GAAP earnings of $367 million, or $0.75 per share, and adjusted earnings of $424 million, or $0.87 per share. This is an increase in adjusted earnings per share of $0.14, or approximately 19% from last year's comparable quarter results. New investments contributed $0.22 per share, primarily reflecting continued growth in our contracted renewables program. The contribution from existing generation assets declined $0.01 per share relative to the prior year comparable quarter as the improvement in wind resource was more than offset by a number of headwinds, including a onetime unfavorable state tax item. After a weak period to the start of the year, when resource improved during the third quarter and was 104% of the long-term average versus 94% in the third quarter of 2018. Contributions from our gas infrastructure business, including existing pipelines increased by $0.03 year-over-year. All other impacts reduced results by $0.10 per share, driven primarily by the write-off of costs related to a development project. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide. The Energy Resources development team continues to capitalize on what we believe is the best renewables development environment in our history, with our backlog increasing by approximately 1,375 megawatts since our last earnings call. Since the last call, we've added 747 megawatts of solar and 340 megawatts of battery storage, all of which will be paired with the new solar projects. Year-to-date, more than 50% of the solar megawatts that we have added to the backlog include a battery storage component, as customers are increasingly interested in a near firm low-cost renewable product that is specifically designed to meet their generation needs. As a result of increased MISO transmission upgrade and their interconnection cost estimates that impacted approximately 1,400 megawatts of industry projects, including some of our own. We have removed 339 megawatts from our wind backlog. Offsetting these reductions are 624 megawatts of new signed contracts since the second quarter call, resulting in a net increase of 285 megawatts to our wind backlog. Additionally, as a result of other customers being impacted by the same interconnection cost issues, we have seen new contracting opportunities develop that we hope to capitalize on over the coming quarters. Through the first three quarters of 2019, we have added nearly 4,200 megawatts to our renewables backlog, which now totals more than 12,300 megawatts. To put our new - our current backlog into context, it is larger than Energy Resources’ operating renewables portfolio at the end of 2014, which took us more than 15 years to develop. Following the terrific year-to-date origination success, we have now largely pivoted our development efforts to 2021 and beyond. With nearly 5,500 megawatts of projects already in our post 2020 backlog, including more than 600 megawatts of wind for 2021 delivery. At this early stage, we have made good progress towards our long-term development expectations. We expect that overall wind demand in 2021 will be roughly the same levels as in 2019 and that solar demand will continue to increase through the early part of the next decade. We continue to believe that by leveraging energy resources competitive advantages, we are well-positioned to capture a meaningful share of these markets going forward. Beyond renewables, we continue to advance construction activities from Mountain Valley Pipeline and expect to be approximately 90% complete by the end of this year. We were pleased that the Supreme Court agreed to hear oral arguments on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline's case related to its Appalachian trail crossing authorization and are hopeful that the Fourth Circuit Courts original decision will be overturned. At this time, we do not expect a material impact on the construction schedule as a result of the FERC stop work order related to MVP’s biological opinion and incidental take statement. Prior to the order, much of MVP’s construction activities had scaled back as a result of a voluntary suspension and the upcoming winter season. We have been working with our project partners to resolve all of the outstanding permit issues for MVP and we continue to make good progress with these efforts. We continue to target a full in-service date for the pipeline during 2020 and now expect an overall project cost estimate of approximately $5.4 billion. Consistent with our focus on leveraging energy resources competitive advantages to identify and develop additional long term contracted projects. Today, we are pleased to announce that we have signed a proceeding agreement for the Lowman Pipeline. The approximately 50-mile, 16-inch intrastate pipeline would supply natural gas under a 40-year from capacity agreement to PowerSouth Energy Cooperative roughly 700 megawatt Lowman Energy Center in Southern Alabama. We believe the project which will support a coal to gas modernization will help provide meaningful benefits to both PowerSouth members through reduced energy costs and to the environment through a reduced emissions. The project which will be wholly-owned by Energy Resources is advancing through the development phase and has a targeted in-service date in mid-2022 subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals. Total capital investment for the pipeline is expected to be between $120 million and $130 million. We look forward to providing additional details as the project advances. Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the third quarter of 2019, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $879 million or $1.81 per share. NextEra Energy’s 2019 third quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $1.163 billion and $2.39 per share, respectively. Adjusted earnings from the corporate and other segment declined $0.11 year-over-year, primarily as a result of the higher interest expense related to the Gulf Power acquisition financing. NextEra Energy has also generated a double-digit percentage increase in year-to-date operating cash flow versus the comparable 2018 period. During the quarter, NextEra Energy issued $1.5 billion of equity units as we continue to focus on opportunistic and prudent capital management to maintain the strength of our balance sheet. The equity units will convert to common equity in 2022 and position us well for continued long-term growth while providing additional cushion against our credit metrics. The financial expectations which we extended through 2022 earlier this year remain unchanged. For 2019, we would be disappointed if we do not realize adjusted EPS growth at the top end of our 6% to 8% growth rate off of the 2018 base of $7.70 per share, which, if achieved, would result in adjusted EPS of $8.32. While we are pleased with our year-to-date results, which have benefited from execution at Gulf Power tracking ahead of our plan, we currently expect headwinds in the fourth quarter adjusted EPS due to a number of factors. As we discussed on our second quarter earnings call, we plan to pursue a number of refinancing activities to take advantage of the low interest rate environment, and expect to incur financing breakage impacts associated with several wind repowering, as well as Energy Resources share of the costs associated with the acquisition of the outstanding Genesis debt. These initiatives could generate negative adjusted EPS impacts of as much as $0.10 to $0.15 in the fourth quarter before translating to favorable net income contributions in future years, and an overall improvement in net present value for our shareholders. Looking further ahead, we continue to expect NextEra Energy's adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate to be in the range of 6% to 8% through 2021 off of our 2018 adjusted EPS of $7.70 plus the accretion of $0.15 and $0.20 in 2020 and 2021 respectively from the Florida acquisitions. For 2022, we expect to grow adjusted EPS in the range of 6% to 8% off of a 2021 adjusted EPS, translating to a range of $10 to $10.75 per share. Based upon the clear visibility into meaningful growth prospects across all of our businesses, we would be disappointed if we are not able to deliver growth at or near the top end of our adjusted EPS range in 2022. From 2018 to 2022, we expect that operating cash flow will grow roughly in line with our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. We also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share 12% to 14% per year through at least 2020 off of a 2017 base of dividends per share of $3.93. As always, our expectations are subject to the usual caveats, including but not limited, to normal weather and operating conditions. In summary, NextEra Energy continues to execute on its strong start to 2019 and remains well positioned to meet its 2019 expectations and long-term growth prospects. At FPL, we remain focused on operational cost effectiveness, productivity, and making smart long-term investments to further improve the quality reliability and efficiency of everything we do. At Gulf Power, we continue to execute the NextEra Energy playbook to create long-term customer and shareholder value. At Energy Resources, we maintain significant competitive advantages to capitalize on the continued strong market for renewables development. We remain intensely focused on execution and believe NextEra Energy remains well-positioned to drive shareholder value over the coming years. Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners, which delivered strong third quarter results, with year-over-year growth in adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution of approximately 55% and 81% respectively. Excluding all contributions from the Desert Sunlight projects, cash available for distribution increased approximately 54% from - versus the prior-year comparable quarter. Yesterday, the next NextEra Energy Partners board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.5175 per common unit or $2.07 for common unit on an annualized basis, continuing our track record of growing distributions at the top end of our 12% to 15% per year growth range. At the end of the quarter, NextEra Energy Partners announced an agreement to acquire Meade Pipeline Company, which owns an approximately 40% interest in Central Penn line, an interstate natural gas pipeline in Pennsylvania that is backed by a minimum 14-year contract with a high credit quality customer and no volumetric risk. The fixed payment structure of Meade’s lease further diversifies the NextEra Energy Partners’ portfolio while helping mitigate any potential wind and solar resource variability. Following the attractive acquisition financing, the transaction is expected to yield a double-digit return to NextEra Energy Partners LP unitholders and generate a CAFD yield of roughly 14% additionally executing on third-party acquisition helps extend NextEra Energy Partners already best-in-class runway for LP distribution growth. We believe this acquisition is consistent with NextEra Energy Partners’ focus on investing in long-term contracted clean energy assets with strong creditworthy counterparties, and that natural gas will play an important role in the country's clean energy future. That said, there are very few pipelines that fit NextEra Energy Partners’ investment criteria of being long-term contracted with creditworthy counterparties. Following the Meade acquisition, NextEra Energy Partners expects the natural gas pipelines will contribute approximately 30% of year-end 2019 run rate cash available for distribution. With roughly 12,000 megawatts of operating long-term contracted wind and solar projects and the ongoing origination success at energy resources combined with the continued strength of the best renewables development environment in our history, we expect contribution percentage from pipelines to decline over time. We continue to believe that NextEra Energy Partners remains uniquely well positioned to capitalize on the ongoing disruption in the nation's power generation fleet over the coming years. The Meade investment is expected to be financed with a combination of partially amortizing project financed debt and a new convertible equity portfolio financing as well as existing NextEra Energy Partners debt capacity. Beyond the Meade financing, during the quarter, NextEra Energy Partners took additional steps to further enhance its financing flexibility, which I will discuss in more detail later in the call. As a result of the expected acquisition and financing initiatives, last month NextEra Energy Partners introduced new year-end 2019 run rate cash available for distribution expectations assuming full contributions from PG&E related projects which at the midpoint represent approximately 60% growth from the comparable year-end 2018 run rate midpoint. With this strong year-over-year growth in cash available for distribution, NextEra Energy Partners expect to be able to achieve its long-term distribution growth expectations without the need for additional asset acquisitions until 2021. Overall, we are pleased with the year-to-date execution in NextEra Energy Partners and believe we are well-positioned to continuing – to continue delivering healthy unit value going forward. Now, let's look at the detailed results. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $315 million and cash available for distribution including full contributions from our Desert Sunlight projects was $147 million, up approximately 55% and 81% from the prior year comparable quarter respectively primarily due to portfolio growth. New projects added $104 million of adjusted EBITDA and $59 million of cash available for distribution. Existing projects also contributed favorably to significant year-over-year growth and adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution. As wind resource is favorable at 107% of the long term average versus 94% in the third quarter of 2018. Cash available for distribution from existing projects also benefited from a reduction in debt service payments as a result of the purchase of the outstanding Genesis holding company notes and the recapitalization of a portfolio of NextEra Energy Partners renewable assets earlier this year. As a reminder, these results include the impact of IDR fees which we treat as an operating expense. For 2019, we previously reported cash available for distribution including full contributions from our PG&E-related projects as we were working on resolving the ongoing financing issues related to the bankruptcy. After finalizing our plans to release the restricted cash of our Genesis project, which I'll discuss in more detail in a moment, we believe it is unlikely that we will pursue remedies that would result in the release of the trapped cash at the Desert Sunlight 250 and 300 projects prior to PG&E’s exit from bankruptcy. Going forward, we will report cash available for distribution, excluding any contribution from Desert Sunlight projects until the event of default have been resolved. For the third quarter, cash available for distribution, excluding all contributions from Desert Sunlight projects was $125 million, an increase of approximately 54% year-over-year. Year-to-date, the Desert Sunlight projects have generated $45 million of cash available for distribution. Starting in early 2020, restricted cash will begin to be scrapped to pay down the outstanding principal balance unless this provision is waived by the project's lenders. Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners recent financing initiatives. The Meade acquisition is expected to be financed with a total of $920 million of partially amortizing project financed debt and a roughly $170 million convertible equity portfolio financing, both of which we have firm commitments for, as well as the existing NextEra Energy Partners’ debt capacity. By leveraging the strong demand for high quality energy infrastructure assets in both the public and private capital markets, NextEra Energy Partners was able to secure attractive financing for the acquisition that enhances returns for LP unitholders by limiting downside risk. During September, NextEra Energy Partners launched a tender offer to purchase 100% of the outstanding operating company notes at our Genesis project. Our current expectation is that by the end of this year, we will have acquired all of the outstanding Genesis debt resulting in an increase in run rate cash available for distribution from the project to approximately $100 million, through the removal of project level debt service. Following the expected purchase of the remaining Genesis debt, NextEra Energy Partners expects to receive approximately $59 million of distributions that have been restricted at the project as of the end of the third quarter, plus approximately $50 million that would have been restricted by year-end. To fund the purchase of the Genesis debt, in September, NextEra Energy Partners issued $500 million of seven-year senior unsecured notes at an attractive yield of 3.875%. The transaction price at historic lows including the lowest spread for a non-investment grade issuer in the power space for that tenor and the second lowest coupon across all industries for that tenor, reflecting NextEra Energy Partners strong credit profile. Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners expectations, as we announced last month, following the completion of the Meade acquisition, our expectations for year-end 2019 run rate cash available for distribution, including full contributions from the PG&E-related projects, increased to a range of $560 million to $640 million, reflecting calendar year 2020 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at the end of 2019. We remain confident that our existing contracts with PG&E will be ultimately upheld in PG&E’s bankruptcy process. And note that both PG&Es and the creditors plans of reorganization propose that all renewable PPAs are assumed by PG&E post bankruptcy. Excluding all contributions from the Desert Sunlight projects, NextEra Energy Partners expects a year-end 2019 run rate for cash available for distribution in the range of $505 million to $585 million. Year-end 2019 run rate adjusted EBITDA expectations which assume full contributions from PG&E-related projects, as revenue is expected to continue to be recognized, increased to $1.225 billion to $1.4 billion following the completion of the Meade acquisition. We also introduced December 31 2020 run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution that are the same as the year-end 2019 run rate expectations. The midpoint of the new cash available for distribution range represents a two-year compound annual growth rate range of more than 25% from the comparable year-end 2018 run rate midpoint assuming full contributions from the Desert Sunlight projects, supporting our long-term distribution growth expectations without the need for additional asset acquisitions until 2021. As a reminder, all of our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and include the impact of anticipated IDR fees as we treat this as an operating expense. From the base of NextEra Energy Partners’ fourth quarter 2018 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $1.86 per common unit, we continue to see 12% to 15% per year growth in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2024 subject to our caveat. For 2020, we expect to achieve these distribution growth objectives while maintaining a payout ratio in the mid-70% range. We are pleased with the progress NextEra Energy Partners has made in 2019 against its strategic and growth initiatives. As we have previously highlighted, NextEra Energy Partners has the flexibility to grow in three ways organically acquiring assets from third parties or acquiring assets from energy resources portfolio. By executing on the Meade acquisition, NextEra Energy has further enhanced its already best-in-class long term visibility into growth and through reduced near-term acquisition needs from energy resources. Without the need to sell common equity until 2021 at the earliest other than modest aftermarket issuances together with an attractive underlying asset portfolio, favorable tax position, and enhanced governance rights, NextEra Energy Partners is well-positioned to deliver long-term LP unitholder value. In summary, we continue to believe that both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners have some of the best opportunity sets and execution track records in the industry and we remain as enthusiastic as ever about our future prospects. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we will open up the line for any questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Greg Gordon of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Greg Gordon: So, a couple of questions, you did put out a press release recently talking about this potential for $25 billion to $35 billion of necessary spending to get the full undergrounding program completed. Can we talk – can you talk about when that might go from sort of theoretical to actually being laid out and executed and over what time frame you might be looking to execute that for the benefit of your customers?
Rebecca Kujawa: Sure, Greg. Some of this stems from - well, a couple of things. One is, as you know, we've had a long program now over many years that Florida Power & Light to invest in storm hardening and resilience across the FPL grid infrastructure. This past legislative session, the Florida State Legislature passed a new law called Storm Secure, that authorizes further investments, including undergrounding our electrical infrastructure, which all of the utilities in Florida will be able to file plans with the Public Service Commission and start to make those investments and recover on those investments through a clause mechanism. What we said about it both at the Investor Conference which at that time the law had not been signed by the governor and then subsequent investor materials is that this represents a multi-decade opportunity and tens of billions of dollars of potential investment into our grid infrastructure. It's going through the process now. The next steps include the Public Service Commission finalizing a rule and having that fully discussed through that process. And then, FPL and Gulf Power would start to file their plans and make those investments and start to recover through the clause.
Greg Gordon: Two more questions. One, with regard to NEP, obviously, the prospects for that business look great. But how do you address like the perspective that even though these gas infrastructure investments you're making make a lot of economic sense, provide good value to the customers that they're serving that it made on the margin be diluting the sort of the clean energy sort of ESG-related aspects of the profile of NEP, even though they do to your point that you've made bring some benefits in terms of personification.
Rebecca Kujawa: We try to cover some of this in the prepared remarks. We've long believed that what is really valuable from an NEP unitholders perspective is our investing in long-term contracted clean energy assets, with creditworthy counterparties. And we believe that gas infrastructure, specifically pipelines to the extent that they meet those criteria, could be a great fit for NEP. And of course, as you know, we executed on an acquisition of some pipeline several years back, and that's added tremendous value to unitholders. This was a unique opportunity. We think the returns are particularly attractive, particularly when you couple that with debt financing that we were able to execute. And as I commented on the prepared remarks, assuming that we are able to close the acquisition, the CAFD related to all of the pipelines would be roughly 30% of the overall portfolio. And as we look forward ,and particularly focusing on NextEra Energy Resources portfolio as an obvious source of potential acquisition targets for NextEra Energy Partners. We have a significant amount of long-term contracted renewables, that could and likely will be sold into NextEra Energy Partners over time. So that percentage of 30%, assuming the close of the acquisition will likely go down over time, particularly since this is a unique opportunity to acquire the Meade Pipeline.
Greg Gordon: My last question is, the delta between the GAAP earnings and the operating earnings is pretty, pretty significant this year, more significant than it has been in some prior years and I understand a lot of that is due to the transition – some transitions related to the business, but can you just take us through as we move through time, do you expect the difference between GAAP and operating results to tighten again, as we move into 2020 and beyond or are there going to be continued structural reasons why we should expect natural gas related or gas infrastructure related or interest rate related adjustments to continue.
Rebecca Kujawa: So, Greg, of course there's a couple of things that are excluded from our adjusted earnings that flow through GAAP. As you highlighted some of the hedges that we enter in Q4 but our power portfolio as well as our gas infrastructure portfolio, the marks related to those investments work both through that. But the bigger driver this year has really been about interest rates. And interest rate cap is going down has contributed to a significant amount of mark that we exclude from adjusted earnings purposes. So, that'll fluctuate over time. We think that the hedging activities that we enter into whether it's hedging or gas and power exposure or interest exposure makes sense both for NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners to ensure that we have the ability to have low cost and continued access to the capital markets over a long period of time.
Operator: And our next question comes from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Steve Fleishman: Just wanted to clarify, I think Rebecca you said that the – you think that in the wind business that 2021 could be as good a year as 2020? Did you…
Rebecca Kujawa: No, no.
Steve Fleishman: Is that correct? Yeah.
Rebecca Kujawa: That’s 2019. Comparable to 2019 - no, 2020 should be a very strong year as our customers are working to take advantage of the last year of 100% PTC. But we do think it’ll be more likely than not comparable to 2019.
Steve Fleishman: And then on the - just, could you maybe talk a little bit more about what the MISO issue was that kind of affected this 1,400 megawatts of clearing projects and just maybe a little more color on the opportunities projects and just made a little more color on the opportunities that you see maybe if gaining some market share there.
Rebecca Kujawa: Sure. Both MISO and SPP have had a significant amount of queue requests be put into their queues over the last couple of years. I think as both developers and those that might buy renewables put in requests ahead of the tax credits trying to phase down. And so, they face some tough modeling issues both for MISO and for SPP that resulted in what we think are some unusual outcomes and high costs for interconnection requests, which affected, in particular, about 1,400 megawatts of industry-wide projects as we commented in the prepared remarks. This creates opportunities for us. So, for some of those projects, there had some obvious customers that wanted to buy some wind and solar projects, which will create opportunities for energy resources to help fill that supply. It also creates the opportunity or incentive for us to optimize our existing queue positions and existing interconnection rights to maximize all the generation that could be filled for those interconnection requests. So, certainly, a speed bump with respect to some of the things in our backlog, but in context of now the substantial backlog that we have really is no more than a minor blip, but we wanted to comment on it given the movement in the backlog.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Stephen Byrd: I wanted to focus on Mountain Valley and just first cover just the process next steps both from a legal perspective as well as with FERC, would you mind just kind of talking through what we should be thinking about from a process point of view from here.
Rebecca Kujawa: Sure. One of the two things that are particularly notable. One is the Supreme Court has decided to take this up as you well know and we'll hear this in the first part of 2020 and ultimately render its decision by June of 2020. So then, we'll understand whether or not the Fourth Circuit's decision in ADP's case which obviously sets the press and also for Mountain Valley pipelines crossing of the Appalachian Trail. The second aspect is finishing up the permitting for Mountain Valley pipeline. The new biological opinion is expected to be issued in the early part of 2020. That obviously would address the current stop work order and set forward the process of finalizing the remaining permitting other than the Appalachian Trail Crossing. So as I've commented in the script, we continue to believe that more likely than not the pipeline will be put into service in 2020. And again, higher costs than we originally had anticipated but approximate now $5.4 billion across all of the partners.
Stephen Byrd: Understood. And how much capital has NextEra invested to date? And if the project were to be canceled due to legal issues, what would the financing implications be for NextEra overall?
Rebecca Kujawa: So we've invested a little bit over $1 billion year-to-date, and that's just our portion of it as opposed to the whole project overall. And what was the second part of the question, Steven, the financing implications?
Stephen Byrd: If the project would be canceled, what would the financing implications be for NextEra?
Rebecca Kujawa: We've got a pretty sizable balance sheet at this point Steve. So not significant implications for us. It certainly would be disappointing from a development standpoint not to be able to complete it. And I think at this point that much less likely than the alternative which is that we expect to bring it into service.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Richard Ciciarelli: This is actually Ritchie Ciciarelli here for Julien. I was just wondering if you can comment on your regulated strategy for the rate case filing? Have you made any decisions around consolidating FPL and Gulf and could that potentially provide additional accretion if you consolidate the capital structures there?
Rebecca Kujawa: So Ritchie, we did make comments at our June investor conference that we were at the early stages of evaluating a merger and ultimately a joint rate case filing between FPL and Gulf. And I’d argue at this point we're probably still in the early stages, as we highlighted then and continue to highlight, our best information at this stage which could change, but our best information at this stage is that we would file in 2021 for new rates in 2022. And that was both for FPL and Gulf. As we get closer to that period of time, we certainly might update that if things change or be able to give you more information, but we're still at the preliminary stages of that.
Richard Ciciarelli : And then can you just comment on the JEA process and I guess expectations for how long that will take, I guess, complete?
Rebecca Kujawa: So, Ritchie, as we’ve commented a couple of times, we're certainly interested in doing more regulated M&A and the processes that are very public both at Santee Cooper and JEA. We've indicated our interests, but at this point, out of respect for both processes that are entering more advanced stages, we're limited on what comments we may make on it. But I'd fall back to the fact that we've continued to be interested and of course as you well know JEA, released its list of folks that made it to the next round and of course we were on there.
Operator: And the next question today comes from Shahriar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.
Shahriar Pourreza: Just a quick follow-up on the 21 GRC filings. You guys sort of formulate your thoughts and get the process together. If I could - can you just highlight maybe some of the arguments you'll present as far as the benefits to FPL customers to have a merged utility? Obviously, the benefits for Gulf stated and it’s - but just sort of as you guys think about as a merged entity where you see the benefits flowing to FPL customers.
Rebecca Kujawa: Shahriar, I think it's – I appreciate the interest in it. I think at this stage to talk specifically about any sort of rate case strategy would be a little bit premature. But you should expect that a lot of what we might talk about would be consistent with what we always talk about with you guys, which is we really do focus on capital investments that make sense for our customers that improve the reliability, remove cost from the system, improve our emissions profile over the long term to make sure that what we provide to our customers is really valuable to them. And we continue to focus on that and be very diligent in those efforts throughout a long period of time in terms of our history with FPL. And as we laid out in great detail at our investor conference, the investment program that we have at Gulf Power over the next couple of years investing roughly $3 billion of capital to have the cost of O&M, substantially improve reliability, substantially improve the emissions profile, and substantially improve the safety profile or certain things that we're proud of and we think are really the right things to focus on from a customer standpoint and ultimately from a regulatory standpoint.
Shahriar Pourreza: And then just, Rebecca, one last topic here is just on the retail choice. I mean, obviously, the Supreme Court has started their review. Maybe just a little bit of an update of thoughts on when you expect the timing from the Supreme Court and just the arguments around single issue and items being on ambiguous. And then as far as maybe just a quick update on the votes and as we hit the February deadline?
Rebecca Kujawa: You’re absolutely right. There are two - just like the last quarter conference call, there were two things that need to happen before the initiative could be put on the ballot. One, the Supreme Court is doing its diligence which as you rightfully highlighted. It's not an evaluation of the merits of the proposal. It is simply whether or not, in my words, not necessarily the legal words, but in my words that a single subject and it’s unambiguous and can be easily understood by the average voter. The hearings were a number of weeks ago and the Supreme Court could render its decision at any time. There's not a specific statutory time frame for them to render their decision. We think in the hearing that issues were brought up and effectively argued that both it is ambiguous and is not single subject. So, we're optimistic that the Supreme Court might render a decision that would be favorable to us but of course, that remains to be seen and we'll hopefully know soon. On the votes, there are roughly 500,000-ish. 460,000 I rounded up relative to the 760-something-thousand votes or signatures that they need to gather before February 1. The practical deadline really is the very beginning of January. There's some time frame for the state to evaluate and validate these signatures. It is not insurmountable but they would need to significantly increase their rate of signature gathering in order to get what they need in order to get on the 2020 ballot.
Shahriar Pourreza: And then just you don't envision a scenario where the Supreme Court renders a decision post the February ballot deadline?
Rebecca Kujawa: We certainly - it seems unlikely, but we don't know. Based on precedent, it seems that it would be more likely not in the next couple of months, but we don't know.
Operator: And our next question comes from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Michael Lapides: I'm looking back at the Investor Day deck and the capital spend trajectory for FPL was about $5.6 billion to $6.2 billion each year through 2022. That implies kind of if you continue to earn at the high end of the band that kind of the law of big numbers starts to kick in and the growth rate of that FPL would actually start to slow down. What are the things that could keep -- what are the things that are not in that $5.6 billion to $6.2 billion CapEx budget that could make that a higher rate base growth trajectory?
Rebecca Kujawa: So we obviously laid out the plans for this period of time through 2020. So I'm assuming you're asking for kind of a post 2020 view. And some of the things that we highlighted in the Investor Conference which still remain very much true today and we even talked about one of them at the very part beginning of the Q&A, two major capital programs that will last well beyond the 2022 expectations period. First is Storm Secure continuing to harden the infrastructure. That, of course, now is even further authorized through the clause mechanism and has a path for recovery of those investments near the time of having made those investments. And then second is a continued build out of solar and FPLs in Gulf service territory. The 30-by-30 program by 2030 is about 10 gigawatts of capacity. If we execute on that exactly to that plan, it's roughly 20% of FPL’s generation will come from solar generation in 2030, which obviously leaves a lot of opportunity for further expansion of solar beyond that time frame.
Michael Lapides: Got it.
Rebecca Kujawa: Just normal investments in the infrastructure.
Michael Lapides: But is most of that for the post-2022 time frame? So, if I think about the 2020 to 2022 time frame, there's not a lot that's going to move that $5.7 billion to $6.2 billion number around?
Rebecca Kujawa: So, we have our expectations. They were the best information that we had at the time and continue to have. Obviously, we reserve the rights to change that investment plan over time, but we think it is a terrific plan that we're excited about, and that really focuses on developing the customer value that we think is so important.
Operator: And our next question comes from Michael Weinstein of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Michael Weinstein: A couple of questions - good morning. A couple of questions about renewables. Have you heard anything about a possible extension of Section 201 solar import tariffs. And then separately from that, at a recent conference, a lot of the developers there were talking about 0% returns through contracted life on wind projects. And I'm just wondering, I mean, you guys are usually in better shape than other people, and I'm wondering what kind of returns you guys are seeing for wind.
Rebecca Kujawa: Okay. I’ll start with the second question first. Our returns are not anywhere near that stated report. We continue to be disciplined in our investment plans, in energy resources. Our returns have remained roughly consistent over a long period of time on a levered basis. And we continue to strongly believe that they're creating value for our shareholders relative to our cost of capital. We can't speak to what other people are investing in. What we do know is that we have significant competitive advantages across this business. Certainly our experience in it is extremely important. It is not only that we have a significant amount scale, we're investing a substantial amount of capital. We've got great relationships with our suppliers where we're a meaningful customer of theirs, And of course we've had continued significant investments in digital technologies to keep getting better at this business every year. So we love the business. We think it's a terrific growth opportunity for us. And as you look out over the next couple of years, you'll continue to see the returns from Energy Resources along the lines of what John highlighted at the investor conference, continue to be very attractive. On the on the tariffs, this changes minute-by-minute and day-by-day. So what our supply chain team continues to focus on is working very closely with our suppliers. Obviously, that story might be a little different between wind and solar, but they have obviously anticipated the uncertainty that could be in the market in the coming years and we've positioned ourselves appropriately so that we can continue executing our developmental program at attractive returns.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Pavel Molchanov: On the power storage front, you've talked about the kind of mainstreaming of storage deployments. I'm curious if in your business development efforts, you found any storage technologies other than lithium-ion that you think are worth commercializing and scaling up in a serious way.
Rebecca Kujawa: We continue - just like we have been with the gas business before, then the wind business, gas business before, then the wind business, then the solar business, we always remain technology agnostic and whatever becomes commercialized that we can deploy at scale with high confidence in the long term total cost of ownership, we would certainly be open to it. That said what we continue to see and what we are currently signing contracts with our customers is predominantly lithium ion but there is a lot of venture capital and a lot of private equity for further stage investments being invested in this space to see if we can find something even better than lithium ion. But with the electric vehicle sector really focusing on lithium ion, those that are producing lithium ion batteries are investing in the manufacturing scale which is producing significant cost improvements and some technology improvements that’s making it very compelling. So, as you look at in our materials, you look at what we think is likely to happen in the middle part of the next decade, you’re talking about a $5 to $7 a megawatt hour adder to get to a nearly firm wind or solar resource. That's a pretty attractive price. So, in order to beat that, you'd have to see a pretty big step change in where some of these other technologies are to truly be competitive.
Pavel Molchanov: And then kind of a corollary to that maybe on the flip side of the value chain, EV charging, any update on the role that you guys are playing in that Florida build out? The state overall still lags behind a lot of the other coastal states in its EV infrastructure. So, curious what you guys are doing to resolve that?
Rebecca Kujawa: It has been a focus in Tallahassee at the state government level to really think about it and think about what part of different companies and organizations might play in it. And we certainly have worked on a couple of pilot opportunities to think about how that infrastructure can be built out. There may be more to do at some point, but we're still evaluating whether or not that's an opportunity within the regulated utilities or potentially on the competitive side.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's question-and-answer session and today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-07-24 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and welcome to the NextEra Energy, Inc. and NextEra Energy Partners, LP, Q2 2019 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Matt Roskot. Please go ahead, sir.
Matt Roskot: Thank you, Jen. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our second quarter 2019 combined earnings conference call for NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. With me this morning are Jim Robo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; Rebecca Kujawa, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; John Ketchum, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources; and Mark Hickson, Executive Vice President of NextEra Energy, all of whom are also officers of NextEra Energy Partners; as well as Eric Silagy, President and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light Company. Rebecca will provide an overview of our results, and our executive team will then be available to answer your questions. We’ll be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today’s earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call in the Risk Factors section of the accompanying presentation on our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found on our websites, nexteraenergy.com and nexteraenergypartners.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. Today’s presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today’s presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of historical non-GAAP measures to the closest GAAP financial measure. With that, I will turn the call over to Rebecca.
Rebecca Kujawa: Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy delivered strong second quarter results and is well positioned to meet its overall objectives for the year. Adjusted earnings per share increased nearly 13% versus the prior year comparable quarter, reflecting successful performance across all of the businesses. FPL increased earnings per share by $0.05 year-over-year. Average regulatory capital employed increased by more than 8% versus the same quarter last year, and all of our major capital initiatives, including the continuation of one of the largest solar expansions ever in the U.S. remain on track. With residential bills nearly 30% below the national average and the lowest among all of the Florida investor-owned utilities, FPL’s focus continues to be on identifying smart capital investments to lower costs, improve reliability and provide clean energy solutions for the benefit of our customers. The execution of the NextEra Energy playbook at Gulf Power, which is focused on reducing cost and using those savings to help fund smart capital investments for the benefit of customers, also continues to progress well. We have made terrific progress on our operational cost effectiveness initiatives, and I’m also pleased to announce that earlier this month, we completed our first major capital project at Gulf Power, the Plant Smith combustion turbine upgrades on schedule and on budget. Through improved efficiency and reliability, these upgrades are expected to generate approximately $40 million of net customer savings over their lifetime. At Energy Resources, adjusted EPS increased by $0.10 year-over-year, primarily reflecting contributions from new investments. We continue to capitalize on one of the best environments for renewables development in our history with our backlog increasing by more than 1,850 megawatts since our first quarter call, including more than 400 megawatts since our investor conference in June. As we highlighted last month, with continued cost and efficiency improvements, we expect new near firm wind and solar to be cheaper than the operating cost of coal, nuclear and less-efficient oil and gas fire generation units even after the tax credits phase down early in the next decade. The combination of low-cost renewables plus storage is expected to be increasingly disruptive to the nation’s generation fleet, providing significant growth opportunities well into the next decade. By leveraging Energy Resources significant competitive advantages, we expect to continue to capture a meaningful share of this opportunity set going forward. We are pleased with the progress we have made at NextEra Energy so far in 2019, and headed into the second half of the year, we are well positioned to achieve the full year financial expectations that we have previously discussed subject to our normal caveats. Now let’s look at the detailed results beginning with FPL. For the second quarter of 2019, FPL reported net income of $663 million or $1.37 per share, which is an increase of $37 million and $0.05 per share respectively year-over-year. Regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 8% over the same quarter last year and was the principal driver of FPL’s net income growth of nearly 6%. FPL’s capital expenditures were approximately $1.2 billion in the second quarter, and we expect our full year capital investments to total between $5.7 billion and $6.1 billion. Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.6% for the 12 months ending June 2019, which is at the upper end of the allowed band of 9.6% to 11.6% under our current rate agreement. During the quarter, we restored $222 million of reserve amortization to achieve our target regulatory ROE leaving FPL with a balance of $607 million. As a reminder, rather than seek recovery from customers of the approximately $1.3 billion in Hurricane Irma storm restoration costs, in 2017, FPL utilized its remaining available reserve amortization to offset nearly all of the expense associated with the write off of the regulatory asset related to Irma cost recovery. During the second quarter, the Florida Public Service Commission ruled that FPL’s actions were permitted under the terms of the current base rate settlement agreement that FPL is able to credit the reserve amount with tax savings resulting from tax reform and that FPL’s rates remain just and reasonable. On July 10, the Office of Public Counsel filed a notice of appeal of this decision with the Florida Supreme Court. Separately, FPL and the Office of Public Counsel and other interveners entered into a settlement regarding the prudence of FPL’s Hurricane Irma storm restoration costs and activities, which was approved by the commission earlier this month. We believe the argument fairly and reasonably balances the interest of FPL and its customers and should create further customer benefits through enhanced storm recovery processes in the future. As we discussed at the investor conference last month, we expect that FPL will file a base rate case in the first quarter of 2021 for new rates that are effective in January of 2022, one year later than would have been necessary in the absence of the commission’s ruling related to reserve amortization and tax reform. This one year delay in the need for a base rate increase creates significant customer value. Turning to our development efforts. All of our major capital initiatives at FPL are progressing well. During the quarter, construction commenced at 10 solar sites across FPL’s service territory. The new plants, which will comprise a total of nearly 750 megawatts of combined capacity, are all on track and on budget to begin providing cost-effective energy to FPL customers by early 2020. Late last month, Governor DeSantis signed legislation into law that allows the recovery of storm hardening investments, including undergrounding. This new law will allow FPL to pursue these storm hardening investments in a programmatic basis over the course of decades for the benefit of customers through improved reliability and reduced storm restoration times. The Florida Public Service Commission is in the early stages of the rule development process, which we expect will result in a proposed rule later this year. Let me now turn to Gulf Power, which reported second quarter 2019 GAAP earnings of $45 million or $0.09 per share and adjusted earnings of $58 million or $0.12 per share. As a reminder, during the first 12 months following the closing of the Gulf Power acquisition, we intend to exclude onetime acquisition costs from adjusted earnings. Additionally, interest expense to finance the acquisition is reflected in the Corporate and Other segment, and this expense offsets the majority of the second quarter Gulf Power adjusted earnings contribution. Gulf Power’s reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 9.9% for the 12 months ending June 2019. For the full year 2019, we continue to target a regulatory ROE in the upper half of the allowed band of 9.25% to 11.25%. During the quarter, Gulf Power’s capital expenditures were roughly $150 million, and we expect the full year capital investments to total between $700 million and $800 million. All of the major capital – Gulf Power capital projects are continuing to progress well. During the quarter, the Florida Public Service Commission approved Gulf Power’s cost recovery petition for the approximately $350 million in Hurricane Michael restoration costs. Subject to a review and prudence determination of the final storm cost, at the beginning of July, Gulf instituted a surcharge equivalent to $8 per month on a 1,000 kilowatt hour residential bill until the storm costs are fully recovered, which is expected to occur after approximately 60 months. As we announced last month, similar to FPL, our current best estimate is that Gulf Power will file a rate case in the first quarter of 2021 for new rates that are effective in January of 2022. In addition, we are in the midst of reviewing that potential benefits from merging the two Florida operating utilities into a single larger Florida utility company. While no decision regarding a potential merger has been made at this time, we are actively evaluating it and looking at both the operational and financial benefits for our customers. We will provide an update on our plans as we get closer to the expected filing of the future rate case. The economy in Florida continues to grow at a healthy pace and remains among the strongest in the nation. The current unemployment rate of 3.4% is near the lowest levels in a decade and remains below the national average. The real estate sector continues to grow with ongoing growth in building permits and a year-over-year increase in the Case-Shiller Index for South Florida of 4%. At the same time, the June reading of Florida’s consumer sentiment remained strong. During the quarter, FPL’s average number of customers increased by approximately 100,000 from the comparable prior year quarter, driven by continued solid underlying growth and the addition of Vero Beach’s roughly 35,000 customers late last year. FPL’s second quarter retail sales increased approximately 6.5% from the prior year comparable period, and we estimate that approximately 5.3% can be attributed to weather-related usage per customer. On a weather normalized basis, second quarter sales increased 1.2% as continued customer growth and weather normalized usage per customer both contributed favorably. For Gulf Power, the average number of customers was roughly flat to the comparable prior year quarter as the recovery from Hurricane Michael continues to progress slowly. Gulf’s second retail sales increased 2.3% year-over-year, primarily due to favorable weather. Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported second quarter 2019 GAAP earnings of $661 million or $1.37 per share and adjusted earnings of $448 million or $0.93 per share. This is an increase in adjusted earnings per share of $0.10 or approximately 12% from last year’s comparable quarter results, which have been restated lower by $12 million or $0.03 per share to reflect the adoption of new lease accounting standards during the fourth quarter of 2018. New investments added $0.09 per share, reflecting continued growth in our contracted renewables program. Weaker wind resource during the second quarter was the primary driver of the $0.06 decline in contributions from existing generation assets. Second quarter fleet-wide wind resource was the second worst for the Energy Resources portfolio over the last 30 years at 93% of the long-term average versus 101% during the second quarter of 2018. Contributions from our gas infrastructure business, including the existing pipelines, increased by $0.02 year-over-year. Our customer supply and trading business contributed a positive $0.06 per share and all other impacts decreased results by $0.01 versus 2018. As I mentioned earlier, Energy Resources development team had another excellent quarter of origination success, adding more than 1,850 megawatts to our backlog. Since our last earnings call, we have added 94 megawatts of new wind projects, 828 megawatts of wind repowering projects and 744 megawatts of new solar projects to our renewables backlog. One of these solar projects will be paired with a 200-megawatt 4-hour battery storage system, continuing our success as we further advance the next phase of renewables deployment that pairs low-cost wind and solar energy with a low-cost battery storage solution to provide a product that can be dispatched with enough certainty to meet customer needs for a nearly firm generation resource. We also executed build-own-transfer agreements for a 99-megawatt wind project and a 75-megawatt solar projects, which are not included in our backlog additions. Our current backlog of more than 11,700 megawatts is the largest we have ever had in our nearly 20-year development history. Of this total, we currently have over 7,600 megawatts that we expect to place into service in 2019 and 2020, which is above the midpoint of our expectations range for this period. Only halfway through 2019, we are pleased to have already signed nearly 4,100 megawatts of contracts for delivery beyond 2020, including roughly 900 megawatts for delivery in 2023, which is a reflection of the continued strong economic demand for wind, solar and battery storage combined with our competitive advantages and renewables development. Beyond renewables, we have ramped up construction activities for MVP and expect to be approximately 90% complete by the end of this year as the project continues to advance towards ultimate completion. We continue to work with our project partners to resolve the outstanding permit issues required for the pipelines construction, including pursuing multiple alternatives to address the Appalachian Trail crossing issue. As we announced last month, we are now targeting a full in-service date for the pipeline during 2020 with the revised overall project cost estimate of approximately $5 billion. As a reminder, we do not expect any material adjusted earnings impacts nor any change to NextEra Energy’s financial expectations regardless of the outcome of the ongoing challenges related to MVP. Turning now to consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the second quarter of 2019, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $1.234 billion or $2.56 per share. NextEra Energy’s 2019 second quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $1.133 billion and $2.35 per share respectively. Adjusted earnings from the Corporate and Other segment were flat year-over-year as higher interest expense related to the Gulf Power acquisition financing was roughly offset by the absence of the unfavorable tax ruling related charge that negatively affected 2018 results. Earlier this month, following the approval from the California Public Utilities Commission, NextEra Energy Transmission acquired Trans Bay Cable, a 53-mile rate-regulated high-voltage direct current underwater transmission cable system, which provides approximately 40% of San Francisco’s daily electrical power needs. We are pleased to close the acquisition and further expand our rate-regulated and long-term contract business operations as we advance our goal of creating America’s leading competitive transmission company. The financial expectations, which we have extended through 2022 last month remain unchanged. For 2019, we would be disappointed if we do not realize adjusted EPS growth at the top end of our 6% to 8% growth rate off of 2018 base of $7.70 per share, which, if achieved, would result in adjusted EPS of $8.32 per share. While we are pleased with our year-to-date results, which have exceeded the top end of our growth rate expectations, we expect the second half growth rate to be lower due to a number of factors. These factors include a number of liability management activities we are currently reviewing to take advantage of the low interest rate environment as well as the financing breakage impact associated with several wind repowerings. Both of these initiatives would generate modest net income impacts in 2019 before translating to favorable net income contributions in future years and an overall improvement in net present value for our shareholders. We will update you on the status of these initiatives as they progress during the year. Looking further ahead, we continue to expect NextEra Energy’s adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range to be in the range of 6% to 8% through 2021 off of our 2018 adjusted EPS of $7.70 per share plus the accretion of the $0.15 and $0.20 in 2020 and 2021, respectively, from the Florida acquisitions. As we announced last month, for 2022, we expect to grow adjusted EPS in a range of 6% to 8% off of 2021 adjusted EPS, translating to a range of $10 to $10.75 per share. Based upon the clear visibility into the meaningful growth prospects across all of our businesses, we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver growth at or near the top end of our 6% to 8% compound annual growth rate range through 2022 plus the specified accretion from the Florida acquisitions in the relevant years. From 2018 to 2022, we expect that operating cash flow will grow roughly in line with our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. We continue to expect to grow our dividends per share 12% to 14% per year through at least 2020 off of a 2017 base of dividends per share of $3.96. As we noted during the investor conference last month, we will be discussing our dividend policy with the Board of Directors in early 2020. We continue to believe that our relatively conservative dividend payout ratio versus peers in our industry and our strong adjusted EPS and cash flow generation growth profile position us well to continue to deliver attractive dividend growth. As always, all of our expectations are subject to the usual caveats, including, but not limited to, normal weather and operating conditions. In summary, we continue to believe that NextEra Energy offers one of the best value propositions in the industry. We had a long-term track record of delivering results for shareholders and remain intensely focused on continuing to achieve our strategic and growth initiatives going forward. NextEra Energy maintains one of the strongest credit ratings and balance sheets in the sector, backed by a largely rate-regulated and long-term contracted asset portfolio. With a strong pipeline of attractive investment opportunities across all of our businesses, we believe NextEra Energy is as well positioned as ever it has ever been to deliver on our financial expectations over the next four years. Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners. Yesterday, the NextEra Energy Partners Board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.5025 per common unit or $2.01 per common unit an annualized basis continuing our track record of growing distributions at the top end of our 12% to 15% per year growth rate range. As we highlighted at the investor conference, NextEra Energy Partners is well positioned to benefit from significant wind and solar growth that is expected in the U.S. over the coming years. With the economic advantages of wind and solar versus traditional energy – traditional generation resources even after the tax credits phase down, we expect renewables to grow at a rate that provides a meaningful tailwind to NextEra Energy Partners growth well into the next decade. With its cost and access to capital advantages, operating cost advantages and with a better than 15-year corporate tax yield, NextEra Energy Partners is as well positioned as ever to capture these growth opportunities. During the quarter, NextEra Energy Partners executed on its plan to continue to expand its portfolio by closing on the previously announced acquisition of approximately 600 megawatts of geographically diverse wind and solar projects from Energy Resources, combined with an associated recapitalization of existing NextEra Energy Partners assets. The transaction was financed with a $900 million convertible equity portfolio financing as well as existing NextEra Energy Partners debt capacity. As part of our ongoing efforts to mitigate the impact of PG&E bankruptcy, late in the second quarter, we launched a tender offer to purchase 100% of the outstanding holding company notes at our Genesis Project that had an interest rate of 5.6%. Our interest in buying the holdco notes reflects our confidence that our existing contracts with PG&E will ultimately be upheld in the bankruptcy process. As we announced earlier this month, we were successful in acquiring approximately $171 million of the $240 million of outstanding principal during the tender process. We were pleased to see the California wildfire legislation pass earlier this month and believe that this was an important step to healthier, more creditworthy California utilities going forward. In particular, we note that the new law provides that if PG&E wants to participate in the wildfire fund, it must emerge from bankruptcy by June 30, 2020. In addition, the California Public Utilities Commission must approve PG&E’s reorganization plan resolving the bankruptcy and confirm that the plan is consistent with California’s climate goals pursuant to the state’s renewable portfolio standard program and related procurement requirements. Separately, we note that a plan of reorganization recently put forward by a group of senior unsecured noteholders proposes, among other things, the continuation of PG&E’s current renewables contracts without disruption or modification. These recent developments are incrementally positive in our view, and we remain confident that PG&E’s bankruptcy will be resolved favorably as it relates to our projects contracts. In addition to closing our second low-cost convertible equity portfolio financing, NextEra Energy Partners demonstrated its ability to access additional low-cost sources of capital with the June issuance of $700 million of five-year senior unsecured notes at an attractive 4.25% yield, the lowest ever coupon for a five-year high-yield issuance in the power sector. We believe the strong demand for the offering is indicative of NextEra Energy Partners superior value proposition supported by diversified cash flows from long-term contracts with strong credit worthy counterparties. NextEra Energy Partners used the proceeds to pay off the outstanding balance of $450 million under its revolving credit facility and to purchase the Genesis holdco – holding company notes that were tendered as well as for general partnership purposes. Earlier this month, following the achievement of certain NextEra Energy Partners’ trading thresholds, we converted one-third or approximately $183 million of the convertible preferred securities that were issued in 2017 into roughly $4.7 million NextEra Energy Partners’ common units. The conversion of the first tranche of these securities helps achieve NextEra Energy Partners’ goal of using low-cost financing products to layer in the equity over time and further supports NextEra Energy Partners’ credit metrics. Finally, at the investor conference, NextEra Energy Partners announced agreements to repower two wind facilities totaling approximately 275 megawatts. Repowerings are expected to be completed in 2020 and provide a number of benefits, including increased generation and longer life assets with lower maintenance costs. The repowerings have a total capital commitment of approximately $200 million and are expected to generate attractive CAFD yields in excess of 10%. As the NextEra Energy Partners’ portfolio continues to further expand, we expect to execute on additional attractive organic growth opportunities. Let me now review the detailed results for NextEra Energy Partners, which were generally in line with our expectations after accounting for the below average wind resource. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $284 million, up 12% from the prior year comparable quarter due to the growth in the underlying portfolio. New projects, which primarily reflect the asset acquisitions that closed at the end of 2018, contributed $83 million. The benefit from new projects was partially offset by the absence of the Canadian assets, which were sold at the end of the second quarter last year as well a decline in the contribution from existing assets of $18 million. This decline is almost entirely the result of lower wind resource, which was 94% of the long-term average, the fourth worst second quarter resource for the NextEra Energy Partners portfolio over the last 30 years versus 102% in the second quarter of 2018. In spite of the strong adjusted EBITDA growth year-over-year, cash available for distribution declined 2% versus the prior year comparable quarter driven primarily by the structural timing of PAYGO tax equity payments. With the acquisition that closed in 2018 all of the PAYGO payments are received in the first and third quarters of the year, which limited the CAFD contributions from new projects in the second quarter, but it’s expected to help contribute to very strong CAFD growth in the third quarter assuming normal resource and operating conditions. As a reminder, these results include the impact of IDR fees, which we treat as an operating expense. Additional details of our second quarter results are shown on the accompanying slide. At the end of the second quarter, approximately $45 million of cumulative cash distributions from PG&E-related products, including Desert Sunlight 250, which is contracted with Southern California Edison, were not distributed as a result of events of default under the financings that arose due to PG&E’s bankruptcy filing. PG&E continues to make payments under all of our contracts for post-petition energy deliveries, and we continue to evaluate all options to protect our interest. NextEra Energy Partners expects to achieve its 2019 growth objectives, assuming no cash is available from PG&E-related projects. Excluding all contributions from the PG&E-related projects, NextEra Energy Partners continues to expect a year-end 2019 run rate for CAFD of $410 million to $480 million, reflecting the calendar year 2020 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at the end of 2019. Year-end 2019 run rate CAFD expectations would be $485 million to $555 million, assuming favorable resolution of the current events of default for our PG&E-related assets. Year-end 2019 run rate adjusted EBITDA expectations, which assume full contributions from projects related to PG&E as revenue is expected to continue to be recognized, remain unchanged at $1.2 billion to $1.375 billion. From a base of NextEra Energy Partners’ fourth quarter 2018 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $1.86 per common unit, we continue to see 12% to 15% per year growth in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2024, subject to our usual caveats. As we previously discussed, upon the closing of the recent acquisition, NextEra Energy Partners also expects to grow the 2019 distribution at 15%, resulting in an annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2019 distribution that is payable on February 2020 to be $2.14 per common unit. Additionally, as a result of the NextEra Energy Partners’ significant financing flexibility, aside from any modest issuances under the aftermarket program or issuances upon the conversion of NextEra Energy Partners’ convertible securities, we continue to expect that NextEra Energy Partners will not need to sell common equity until 2021 at the earliest. As we highlighted last month, the combination of NextEra Energy Partners’ successful completion of its identified growth – organic growth investments, which included the previously announced expansion at our Texas pipelines as well as the wind repowerings that I discussed earlier combined with the successful resolution of the PG&E bankruptcy and an associated future release of cash flow from the PG&E-related assets would result in approximately 22% uplift in the run rate cash available for distribution from year-end 2019 levels. This is roughly 1.5 years of current CAFD and distributions per unit growth for NextEra Energy Partners, highlighting the significant embedded upside that exists within the portfolio. We continue to believe that NextEra Energy Partners offers a very attractive investor value proposition. NextEra Energy Partners maintains clear visibility into its future growth prospects with continued flexibility to grow in three ways. Through organic growth, third-party acquisitions or through acquisitions from NextEra Energy Resources. With a substantial growth in – the substantial forecasted growth in the renewable sector, NextEra Energy Partners is expected to benefit from a strong growth backdrop for years to come. Additionally, the financing transactions that closed this quarter demonstrate NextEra Energy Partners continued ability to access low-cost financing to support its growth. With significant financing flexibility and attractive underlying portfolio, a favorable tax position and enhanced governance rights, NextEra Energy Partners is well positioned to meet its growth objectives, and we remain focused on continuing to create value for LP unitholders going forward. In summary, as we detailed last month at the investor conference, we continue to believe that both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners have some of the best opportunity sets and execution track records in the industry, and we remain as enthusiastic as ever about our future prospects. This concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we will open up the line for questions.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Stephen Byrd: Good morning. Congratulations on the good results. I wanted to just circle back to the point you had raised about assessing the benefits of merging the utility businesses. I know it’s premature to talk in detail, but could you just describe at a high-level the types of finance and operational benefits you’re considering, some of the key sort of elements that we should be at least thinking about there?
Rebecca Kujawa: Hi Stephen, so we talked very briefly about this, both Eric and Marlene did last month at the investor conference, and it really is – the timing is aligned with when we might – based on the best information we have now when we might file for rate cases both at Gulf Power and FPL. And as part of that, we will consider whether or not it makes sense to merging these two entities together. It very much is in the early stages of that evaluation, but because we’re starting to think about it and some of the investments that we make or planning to make in the next couple of years certainly would facilitate that. When we’ll be talking to different stakeholders about it, we thought it prudent to talk to investors about it, but we are very much at the early stages. We expect that there are certain operational benefits and certainly some potential financial benefits from leveraging the scale and scope of both companies together. But as far as details, that – all of that analysis is still to be done.
Stephen Byrd: Understood. Just wanted to shift over to the update you gave on PG&E. We agree that does not seem very likely at all that then any contracts will be modified in any way. If PG&E does not emerge by next summer, are there other approaches that you could take to potentially free up the cash? I mean over time that cash balance will be pretty significant at the projects. Are there sort of other options on the table beyond simply the focus on ensuring PG&E does successfully exit?
Rebecca Kujawa: We’ll continue to talk with all of the critical parties, including the lenders as well as the Department of Energy, which is guarantees a couple of the projects’ debt with some of the contracts that we have with PG&E. But as you know, and I think we talked about after our December quarter call in January, after a period of time, some of that cash flow starts to sweep debt service. So while there is a balance of cash, at some point, it starts to get swept. And so what we’re really focused on is releasing the longer-term run rate cash flow, which is what our comments were focused on today. We certainly pursue all avenues, but really the best way to free it up for the long term is to have the resolution to the bankruptcy process.
Stephen Byrd: Understood. Thank you very much.
Rebecca Kujawa: Thank you, Stephen.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Steve Fleishman: Yes, good morning. So first question just on the comments regarding some of the second half activities you might do which sounds like you may be got some cushion in this year. So I think you mentioned liability management. I assume that’s just refinancings you will have to expense upon premium for this year. But could you explain the second one, the wind repowerings, a little more and what you’re doing there and the impact in the second half?
Rebecca Kujawa: Yes. Wind repowerings will be similar to the other type of restructurings you just mentioned in terms of financing taking advantage of prepaying today to have the longer-term lower interest rates over the long term. But specific to – excuse me, some of the repowerings, some of those have financings in place whether they’re tax equity structures or project finance that over time as we’ve executed the repowering program, some of those we needed to terminate early. Some of them it’s just simply essentially making the make-whole of whatever the interest rate was and whatever the prevailing interest rates are. Sometimes there are some penalties in make-wholes for – particularly on the tax equity structures to make tax equity partners whole. So to the extent that we have to accelerate those and realize them, there may be a negative net income impact, which we’re expecting for a couple of the financings between NEP and Energy Resources in the latter part of this year. But again from a net present value standpoint, for investors, these are home runs because they enable attractive repowering opportunities and at the same time entering into the long-term financing to use really, really low interest rate environments.
Steve Fleishman: Okay. Good. And then just a quick question on MVP. I think since your Analyst Day, the Supreme Court filings were made on ACP. And in the Solicitor General filing, there was some comments on the land swap issue in there. Could you just give some color on that? And how you looked at those comments?
Rebecca Kujawa: Sure. As we talked about in the prepared remarks, we continue to believe that MVP is progressing fine. We’re going to resume construction activities and try to be 90% complete by year-end. And what we commented on is the in-service date of in 2020, and there is a number of paths, including down the Supreme Court path as well as the land exchange and certain other options that we have, and we’re going to continue pursuing all of those different paths. I don’t want to comment specifically on the Solicitor General’s comments. Obviously, this is a – this is going to be a process. We have certain views on whether or not we’ve got opportunities to go down the land exchange path, but I don’t want to make any specific comments.
Steve Fleishman: Okay. And then one last quick one, just the NEP convert, which convert was…
Rebecca Kujawa: This is the preferred that was issued in 2017, and we have the right to convert one-third of that as long as it met the minimum price and volume thresholds, which we achieved couple of weeks ago, and we did convert them into equity. Another one-third of the preferred security will be available for conversion later this year.
Steve Fleishman: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Rebecca Kujawa: Good morning, Julien, are you there? Okay, we should take the next question.
Operator: We’ll now take our next question from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.
Shar Pourreza: Good morning, guys. Just around Gulf Power, just maybe a quick update on sort of how the accretion guide is tracking and how the integration is going? But more importantly, Rebecca, it seems like you guys are looking to file a GRC sooner than later despite having material amount of efficiencies on the fuel and non-fuel side that should theoretically be able to subsidize spending opportunities for at least a few years. So what’s the thought process there? Is it solely because you guys are looking at the merger? Are you looking at true-up rates closer to FPL? What’s driving the rate case to come sooner than previously planned?
Rebecca Kujawa: Okay. I’ll take them in successive order. As far as how integration efforts are going, they are going very well. And Marlene had a full set of comments about that last month and things have continued to progress well and now intervening months since then. All of the cost opportunities, cost-saving initiatives that we sought were there or certainly there and we’re starting to execute on it. As we talked about in the prepared remarks, we’re already starting to implement the capital investment program, including the completion of the Plant Smith combustion turbine upgrades that we just completed in the period. So we’re very optimistic and excited about it. We have had a couple of pennies of accretion on a net basis between the operating results that you saw at Gulf Power as well as the offsetting interest expense, which, as I reminded everybody today, is showing up in the Corporate and Other segment. But this is essentially in line with our expectations, and we continue to remain confident about the accretion targets as we reiterated today of $0.15 and $0.20 next year and 2021, respectively. With respect to general rate case, as we highlighted last month and we talked about it again today, our best estimate based on everything that we see, including the ability to take out cost in the business as well as invest significant amounts of capital in Gulf Power to realize all of these net customer benefits that we’ve talked about would result in a rate case filing in 2021 for new rates 2022.
Shar Pourreza: Got it. And then just – is there anything you can disclose as far as how we should think about the true-up of the cap structure and the bands?
Rebecca Kujawa: Not at this point. We are such at the early stages of all of those types of thought process. Again, first reason why we started going down this path of thinking about the operational benefits and certainly the financial benefits of leveraging the scale between the two entities, but there is a lot of work to be done to think through what this would look like. So early, early stages.
Shar Pourreza: Got it. And then just lastly on Senate Bill 796, right, with the proposed decision as you kind of highlighted in your prepared remarks sometime this year, when do you sort of expect to file your plan? And sort of how should we think about this in the context of Gulf versus FP&L service stories? Where do you start to see more of that capital being deployed?
Rebecca Kujawa: In terms of the process, the first next step before we can file any plan is for the rule to actually be proposed at the Florida Public Service Commission, go through the rule development process. And then once there is a final rule, then we would file a plan and evaluate the plan and then ultimately start investing and seeking recovery of those investments. But the plan that we talked about last month, both for Florida Power & Light Company and Gulf Power, anticipated making some of these investments in both undergrounding and storm hardening and is included in our capital investment forecast plans for both companies going forward. And really the way you should be thinking about this is this is a – increases our visibility from a – to a multi-decade investment opportunity.
Shar Pourreza: Got it, extensive run way. Okay, thanks so much, Rebecca
Operator: We’ll now take our next question from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Michael Lapides: Hey, guys. Can you talk a little bit about wind and solar development in the U.S. in terms of just where you’re seeing changes to geographically, meaning across the country in the opportunity set for wind versus solar versus where your historical development occurred?
Rebecca Kujawa: Michael, as costs have come down, I would say, the biggest change in the dynamic is that for wind, you’ve seen the expansion of where it’s very economic out from the middle part of the U.S. further both to the east and to the west. And for solar, an expansion of where it’s economic from the south moving northwards, but that’s a very general broad trend. Overall, what we’ve seen is very positive reception from our customers, and that what is truly the lowest cost generation opportunity for them in many of their jurisdictions. In some cases, it’s going to be wind; in some cases, it’s going to be solar. But as you can see from our backlog, we’ve got enormous opportunities from both wind and solar. And the way that we run our Energy Resources development business is make sure that we have offerings for whatever our customer ultimately wants to buy.
Michael Lapides: Got it. And there’s been some discussion, especially among some of the big kind of largely capitalized European integrated oil companies about their entering into the – or gaining a bigger presence in the U.S. renewables market place. Can you talk about how you think that impacts the competitive dynamic going forward for you guys?
Rebecca Kujawa: Competitors have come in and out of this market many times over our multi-decade exposure to developing wind and now solar generation resources. And if you look at history of market penetration, PPA is both for wind and solar, you will see that there are couple of big players and then a ton of players that get 100, 200 megawatts any given year. So if you talk to our development organization, they will see people a lot of what our Head of Development calls two guys in an Avis car having an opportunity or an edge in a particular area win a contract or two here or there. This business is always been competitive. And where we focused our efforts is ensuring that we maintain or further enhance our competitive advantages. That certainly starts with scale. It expands to our capital advantages the fact that when we buy from our suppliers were often their top customer and if not the top, certainly in the top 10, which gives us some advantages. And as you guys well know, all of our investments in enhanced digital capabilities, which enable us to identify sites better, build things more efficiently and then over a long period of time operate them more efficiently. So as long as we can maintain competitive advantages, we’ll maintain our ability to win our fair share of the market as it continues to grow in a rapid pace.
Michael Lapides: Got it. Thank you guys, much appreciate it.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, can you hear me now?
Rebecca Kujawa: We can hear you, Julien.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: All right. Great. Let’s do it again. So perhaps just firstly, let me start with a little more strategic question here with respect to some of the peers in the states. There seems to be some headlines with respect to decisions for privatization. Just curious if there’s any statement or thought process on that front, given some of the prior comments you’ve made around looking at municipalizations going private?
Rebecca Kujawa: Okay. Is this – are you talking about the new regulation initiative?
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: JEA, I suppose.
Jim Robo: Obviously, we think we could bring a lot to the table with any utility in Florida. We think – obviously, we run the best utility in the world we think. And so we think we would bring a lot to the customers of those utilities in Florida who would be interested in selling. And obviously, we serve very close to that area – very close to JEA’s area. We’ve had a terrific relationship with JEA over a long period of time. We’ve been partners with them. And so we’re going to follow it closely and try to be as constructive as possible.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Excellent. And if I can go back to one of the last questions, just to be exceptionally clear about this. I know that you added a line here on your slides with respect to not being disappointed to be at the top end of the 6% to 8%, which would – if achieved, would result in adjusted EPS of $8.32 versus the 2019 range of $8 to $8.50. Just want to be exceptionally clear on what you’re saying there.
Rebecca Kujawa: Yes. So we continue to focus on – from a long-term standpoint of growing our adjusted EPS to 6% to 8% and, of course, adding the accretion from the Florida acquisitions in those relevant years that we’ve called out. Every year, there is variability in operations and performance, and so we provide a range around that, given a lot of different factors. We commented also that, of course, if you look at the numbers year-to-date, we have a growth that very much exceeds the 8% run rate, which we’re thrilled about and reflect strength in each part of our business, which obviously positions us well to continue executing on our long-term growth targets. As opportunities present themselves, as we comment on today, if you looked back a year ago, we would not have forecasted that interest rates would be at this environment. And there are certain things that we can take advantage of that create shareholder value for the long term and take advantage of the low interest rate environment, and there also some of the investments that we plan to make for repowering that create certain one-time negative events in 2019 in order to enable those repowerings that create substantial shareholder value that will certainly weigh on the growth rate relative to the first half in the second half. So we’re targeting the 6% to 8% growth rate long term, as you well know. 8% of the last year would result in $8.32 per share.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. I think I get you. All right, I’ll leave it there.
Jim Robo: Julien, this is Jim. The important number is $10.75 in 2022.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Absolutely. Thank you all.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Maheep Mandloi: This is Maheep Mandloi on behalf of Michael Weinstein. One question on the undergrounding legislation. And how do you expect the underground legislation impacting the utility rate base growth in the near and long term? And how does that play in relation to the 6% to 8% growth rate?
Rebecca Kujawa: As we talked about last month at the investor conference, we were certainly very pleased with the legislation because, I think, it reflects at least as much as anything else that critical stakeholders across Florida appreciate the value of the resilience and a fast restoration process in Florida when we inevitably have hurricane or significant storm activity. We certainly were aware of the legislation, and we talked about that at our investor conference last month and incorporated continuing to make investments in storm hardening and storm undergrounding over a long period of time in those capital plans that we laid out last month. So really, I think, the focus from investor standpoint should really take some incremental confidence in that long-term program – long-term visibility again multi-decade visibility that we have to investing in the grid to improve – further improve the resilience and hardening to weather storms effectively.
Maheep Mandloi: Got that. And then just pivoting to renewables, could you just remind us again if you would be willing to explore the residential rooftop solar market in the near future? Or any thoughts on either the residential or the distributed generation commercial business out there?
Rebecca Kujawa: As you would expect from an Energy Resources’ standpoint, we look at all sorts of development opportunities, particularly in the renewable sector across any sort of the customer base. We do have a distributed generation business. They predominantly focused on C&I investment opportunities, but they occasional look at residential. We just probably don’t talk about it as much as other might because we’re deploying $50 billion to $55 billion of capital over the next four years. And so if you think about DG opportunities, it’s a little bit smaller than some of the scale we may talk about more frequently.
Jim Robo: And that’s a great point that Rebecca just made. We are the largest C&I distributed generation developer in the country. We never talk about it. It’s not supergiant capital for us because of the context of the $55 billion, but we’re the biggest in the country in that business.
Maheep Mandloi: All right. Thanks for taking my question.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We will take our next question from Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
Colin Rusch: Thanks so much. With SEIA’s launch of the campaign to extend the ITC, could you guys talk a little bit about your expectations for prospects on that? Any sort of behavior changes that you’re seeing from the supply chain at this point?
Rebecca Kujawa: Are you talking about the investment tax credit?
Colin Rusch: Correct. Yes.
Rebecca Kujawa: Yes. I see. Sorry, I thought perhaps you’re talking about something else. So yes, from investment tax credit and production tax credit standpoint, we have benefited from the last couple of years of some of the like most significant visibility to long-term incentives as the industry has ever had, and we can remain focused on executing against those opportunities with the ITC being at full value assuming you execute on an effective safe harbor strategy through 2023, we’ve got a lot of visibility to execute against our development plans. As you know, when the tax credits were last extended and implemented, the phase down that’s now currently in place, we are very supportive of that as an industry and our company specifically because we believe the things that we have talked to you about over time, including everything we laid out last month investor conference, that without incentives or with ITC being down to 10%, you have wind and solar generation being the most effective from a cost-effective standpoint generation in the U.S. compared to coal and nuclear facilities that are – just have their operating costs. So we’re excited about our development program. If something changed in the incentives more favorably, that would potentially create additional tailwind for us and the overall growth of the industry, but we’re focused on execution.
Colin Rusch: Okay. Great. And then just shifting gears back to the distributed generation development program. There’s actually been an awful lot of maturation of micro grid technology in the last, call it, 12 to 24 months. And I’m curious how aggressive you think you might move into the point some of those technologies as we see battery costs really get down to a level where – primarily within the integration technologies getting mature enough to actually handle the functionality. How do you see that playing out over the next few years?
Rebecca Kujawa: Well, as Jim highlighted and I talked about as well, from a development standpoint, we’ll continue to pursue opportunities and we’ll stay involved in those markets in order to make sure that we’re aware of the trends and where things are becoming more cost effective and there may be opportunities for us in the future to invest more heavily. But at this stage, it’s pretty early and the investment opportunity is relatively small compared to some of the other things that we’re focused on and that we talk about more frequently.
Colin Rusch: Great. Thank you so much.
John Ketchum: This is John. I mean, one thing to add to that is, as part of our DG efforts, we certainly do focus on behind the meter and demand response solutions. It’s a fully integrated solution that we’re bringing to our customers.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time, and this concludes the conference. Thank you for attending today’s presentation.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-04-23 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the NextEra Energy Inc. and NextEra Energy Partners LP Q1 2019 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Matt Roskot, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Matthew Roskot: Thank you, Dorie [ph]. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter 2019 combined earnings conference call for NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. With me this morning are Jim Robo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; Rebecca Kujawa, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; John Ketchum, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources; and Mark Hickson, Executive Vice President of NextEra Energy, all of whom are also officers of NextEra Energy Partners, as well as Eric Silagy, President and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light Company. Rebecca will provide an overview of our results and our executive team will then be able to answer your questions. We will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call, in the Risk Factors section of the accompanying presentation, on our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found on our websites, nexteraenergy.com and nexteraenergypartners.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. Today's presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of historical non-GAAP measures to the closest GAAP financial measure. With that, I will turn the call over to Rebecca
Rebecca Kujawa: Thank you, Matt, and good morning everyone. NextEra Energy delivered strong first quarter results and is well positioned to meet its overall objectives for the year. Adjusted earnings per share increased approximately 12% year-over-year reflecting successful performance across all of our businesses. FPL increased earnings per share $0.20 from the prior year comparable period, which was driven by continued investments in the business for the benefit of our customers. The roughly 1,750-megawatt Okeechobee Clean Energy Center, which is among the cleanest and most fuel efficient power plants of its kind in the world, entered service at the end of the first quarter on budget and ahead of schedule. During the quarter, FPL also successfully completed the construction on schedule and on budget of nearly 300 megawatts of cost effective solar projects built under the Solar Base Rate Adjustment or SoBRA, mechanism of our settlement agreement. By executing on smart capital investments such as these, FPL is able to maintain our best-in-class customer value proposition of clean energy, low bills, high reliability and outstanding customer service. FPL’s typical residential bill remains nearly 30% below the national average and below the level it was in 2006, while our service reliability has never been higher. The integration of Gulf Power, which we closed on at the start of the first quarter, continues to progress smoothly. We are now focused on ensuring we successfully execute on key systems and capital initiatives. We have already begun to see significant benefits from our focus on operational cost effectiveness with base retail O&M cost down nearly 5% year-over-year. Consistent with our focus at FPL, we are also identifying smart capital investments to further reduce costs and improve overall customer value proposition. By executing on this strategy, we expect the acquisition to benefit customers, shareholders and the Florida economy. At Energy Resources, adjusted EPS increased by $0.10 per share year-over-year primarily reflecting contributions from new investments. There was another strong quarter of renewables origination with our backlog increasing by nearly a 1000 megawatts since the last call. Included in these backlog additions, is our first co-located, combined, wind, solar and storage project. As we further advanced the next phase of renewables deployment, the pair's low cost wind and solar energy with a low cost battery storage solution to provide a product that can be dispatched with enough certainty to meet customer needs for a merely firm generation resource. At this early point in the year, we are pleased with our progress at FPL, Gulf Power and Energy Resources. Now let's look at the detailed results beginning first with FPL. For the first quarter of 2019, FPL reported net income of $588 million or $1.22 per share. Earnings per share increased $0.20 year-over-year. Regulatory capital employed growth of 8.3% was a significant driver of FPLs EPS growth versus the prior year comparable quarter appeals. FPL’s Capital expenditures were approximately $1.1 billion for the quarter, and we expect our full year capital investments to be between $5.7 billion and $6.1 billion. Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.6% for the 12 months ending March 2019 compared to 11.2% for the 12 months ending March, 2018. During the quarter, we utilized $156 million of reserve amortization to achieve our target regulatory ROE leaving FPL with a balance of $385 million. As we previously discussed, FPL historically utilizes more reserve amortization in the first half of the year, given the pattern of its underlying revenues and expenses and we expect this year to be no different. We continue to expect that FPL and 2020 with the sufficient amount of surplus to continue operating under the current base rate settlement agreement for up to two additional years, creating further customer benefits by avoiding a base rate increase during this time. Turning to our development efforts, we continue to identify smart capital investments to further enhance our already best-in-class customer value proposition. Consistent with the "30-by-30" plan we announced earlier this year, FPL’s Ten-Year Site Plan that was filed with the Florida Public Service Commission earlier this month included plans for roughly 7,000 megawatts of additional cost effective solar projects across Florida over the coming years. This includes the approximately 300 megawatts that remain under the SoBRA mechanism of our settlement agreement as well as, the nearly 1,500 megawatts of SolarTogether community solar projects that we expect to construct over the next two years subject to approval by the Florida Public Service Commission. Through SolarTogether, which would be the nation's largest community solar program participating customers will subscribe to a portion of new solar power capacity and in return they will receive credits that are expected to reduce their monthly bills over time. During the initial pre-registration period, customer demand for the voluntary program was substantial, with approximately 200 of FPL’s largest energy users indicating more than 1100 megawatts of intended participation. The 20 new universal solar sites that are currently planned for this program are projected to cost approximately $1.8 billion and generate an estimated $139 million in net lifetime savings with non-participating customers expected to receive 20% of this total. To support what is one of the largest ever solar expansions, FPL has already secured approximately 7 gigawatts of potential sites. During the quarter, FPL also announced its modernization plan to replace two existing natural gas steam units totaling approximately 1,650 megawatts with clean and renewable energy, including the world's largest solar powered battery system. The 409-megawatt, 900-megawatt hour Manatee Energy Storage Center is expected to increase the predictability of the existing co-located solar project, enabling FPL to more efficiently dispatch other power plants. The project is expected to enter service in 2021 and save customers more than $100 million, while eliminating more than 1 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions. We will provide additional detail on these announcements and other capital initiatives at our June investor conference. Let me now turn to Gulf Power, which reported first quarter 2019 net income of $37 million dollars or $0.08 per share. During the first 12 months, following the closing of the Gulf Power acquisition, we intend to exclude onetime acquisition integration costs, including those related to enhanced early retirement programs, severance and system costs. We do not intend to exclude any integration costs beyond this year. Interest expense to finance the acquisition is reflected in the Corporate and Other segment, and largely offsets the first quarter of Gulf Power net income contribution. Gulf Power’s reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 10.0% for the 12 months ending March 2019. For full year 2019, we are targeting a regulatory ROE in the upper half of the allowed band of 9.25% to 11.25%. We expect to achieve the regulatory ROE expansion through operating efficiencies, while making significant capital investments to improve the value proposition for our Gulf Power customers. During the quarter, Gulf Power’s capital expenditures were roughly $100 million and we expect our full year capital investments to be approximately $700 million. We will provide additional details on Gulf Power’s operating plan and capital investment opportunities in June. During the quarter, Gulf Power filed a cost recovery petition for the approximately $350 million in Hurricane Michael restoration costs. Subject to a review and prudence determination of the final storm costs by the Florida Public Service Commission, Gulf is proposing a surcharge equivalent to $8 per month on a 1000 kilowatt hour residential bill until the storm costs are fully recovered, which is expected to occur after approximately 60 months. Gulf Power believes that the proposed surcharge strikes an appropriate balance between ensuring timely cost recovery and mitigating customer bill impacts. The Florida economy continues to show healthy results and is among the strongest in the nation. The current unemployment rate of 3.5% is near the lowest levels in a decade and remains below the national average. The real estate sector continues to grow with average building permits in the Case-Shiller index for South Florida up 11.6% and 4.8% respectively versus the prior year. Florida's consumer confidence level also remains near a 10-year high. During the quarter, FPL’s average number of customers increased by approximately 100,000 from the comparable prior year quarter, driven by continued solid underlying growth as well as the addition of Vero Beach's roughly 35,000 customers late last year. FPL’s first quarter retail sales increased 0.5% year-over-year. Partially offsetting customer growth was a decline in overall usage per customer of 0.5% driven by unfavorable weather, and an estimated 0.1% decrease in weather normalized usage per customer. A slight decline in underlying usage is a reversal from the trend over the past 12 months, but as we have often discussed, this measure can be volatile over time. We will continue to monitor closely and analyze the underlying usage and we'll update you on future calls. For Gulf Power, the average number of customers was roughly flat to the comparable prior year quarter. We estimate that hurricane Michael resulted in a decrease of approximately 7000 customers, roughly offsetting the strong growth experienced during the earlier months of 2018. Overtime we expect that 60% to 80% of these customers will return as they are able to rebuild and otherwise recover from this devastating storm. Gulf Power’s first quarter retail sales decreased 7.5% year-over-year primarily due to milder than normal weather in 2019 relative to the extreme cold experienced in January of 2018. As a reminder, unlike FPL, Gulf Power does not have a reserve amortization mechanism under its settlement agreement to offset fluctuations in revenue or costs. Now let me turn to Energy Resources, which reported first quarter 2019 GAAP earnings of $301 million or $0.63 per share, and adjusted earnings of $448 million or $0.93 per share. This is an increase in adjusted earnings per share of $0.10 or approximately 12% from last year's comparable quarter results. Last year’s first quarter results have been restated higher by $9 million or $0.02 per share to reflect the adoption of new lease accounting standards during the fourth quarter of 2018. New investments added $0.08 per share primarily reflecting the roughly 1,700 megawatts of new contracted wind and solar projects that were commissioned during 2018. Weaker wind resource during the first quarter was responsible for roughly the entire $0.10 decline in contributions from existing generation assets. First quarter fleet wide wind resource was one of the worst over the past 30 years at 91% percent of the long term average, versus 102% during the first quarter of 2018. We continue to have confidence in the accuracy of our long term wind resource assumptions and expect to continue to experience both positive and negative quarterly variability. The appendix of today's presentation includes a slide with additional details of long term resource variability for the current Energy Resources’ wind portfolio. Beyond Renewables, our other existing generation assets continue to perform well. We were pleased to receive the 20-year license extension for the Seabrook’s Nuclear facility, allowing the profitable plant to continue to offer the New England states attractively priced carbon free energy until at least 2050. Our gas infrastructure business including pipelines, and the customer supply and trading businesses both contributed favorably to the first quarter results. All other impacts including small favorable year-over-year tax items and low corporate G&A due to the timing of development activity increased results by $0.03 versus 2018. As I mentioned earlier, The Energy Resources Development team had another strong quarter of origination. We added 223 megawatts of wind projects to our backlog, including a 100 megawatt build own transfer project, with a 30-year O&M agreement that will allow the customer to leverage Energy Resources best-in-class operating skills while providing ongoing revenue through the contract term. We also added 485 megawatts of solar projects and 50 megawatts four hour battery storage projects to our backlog. And 110 megawatt solar plus storage build-own-transfer agreement during the quarter, which is not included in our backlog additions. Our wind repowering program also continued to progress during the quarter, as we added a 195 megawatts to our backlog and commissioned an additional 55 megawatts of repowered projects. Although we expect to continue to sign projects that will go into service before the end of 2020 in the coming months, we are pleased that we already have nearly 2,700 megawatts in backlog for 2021 and beyond. Beyond renewables, while we continue to advance MVP toward ultimate completion and we expect to ramp up construction activities in the coming months, the Fourth Circuit's decision not to pursue, an en banc review on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline Appalachian trail crossing authorization presents a challenge to both timing and cost. Since the original court decision, we have been working with our project partners on several alternatives to address the issue, and we continue to vigorously pursue these tasks. At this point our previously announced fourth quarter 2019 target in-service date appears unlikely. We are continuing to work through options with our partners and we'll provide a further update in the near future. As a reminder, we do not expect any material adjusted earnings impacts, nor any change to NextEra Energy’s financial expectations regardless of the outcome of the ongoing challenges related to MVP. Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy; for the first quarter of 2019, GAAP’s net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $680 million or $1.41 per share. NextEra Energy’s 20 19 first quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $1.06 billion and $2.20 per share respectively. Adjusted earnings from the corporate and other segment decreased $0.14 per share compared to the first quarter of 2018, primarily due to higher interest expense as a result of the financing related to the Gulf Power acquisition. Since the last call, we have completed approximately $5.2 billion and longer term financing transactions to replace the bridge loans that were executed prior to Gulf Power closing. These financing are both fixed and floating rate and are for a variety of maturities between one and a half and 60 years, with a weighted average tenure of roughly 12 years, and a weighted average interest rate of 4.4% including the effect of the interest rate swaps we entered into at the time of the acquisition announcement. After closing these transactions, we repaid the bridge loans and settled the interest rate hedges. During the quarter, NextEra Energy Transmission received FERC approval to acquire Trans Bay Cable, a 53-mile, rate regulated, high-voltage, direct current underwater transmission cable system, which provides approximately 40% of San Francisco's daily electrical power needs. We continue to expect to close the acquisition later this year, assuming we receive the required approval from the California Public Utilities Commission, which is the last material condition outstanding. Based on our first quarter performance at NextEra Energy, we remain comfortable with the expectations we have previously discussed for the full year. For 2019, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share to be at or near the top end of our previously disclosed 6% to 8% growth rate off a 2018 base of $7.70 per share. Our longer term expectations through 2021 remain unchanged and we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver growth at the at or near the top end of our 6% to 8% compound annual growth rate range off of our $7.70 base realized in 2018 plus the expected deal accretion from the Florida transactions. From 2018 to 2021, we expect that operating cash flow will grow roughly in line with our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. As always, our financial expectations assume normal weather and operating conditions. In summary, after a strong start to the year, we remain as enthusiastic as ever about NextEra Energy's future prospects. At FPL, we continue to focus on delivering our best-in-class customer value proposition through operational cost effectiveness, productivity, and making smart long term investments. The Gulf Power integration continues to advance well, and everything we see today leaves us even more confident about our ability to deliver the financial expectations we have previously outlined for Gulf, while improving the customer value proposition. Energy Resources maintains significant competitive advantages and continues to capitalize on the best renewables development period in our history. Combined with the strength of our balance sheet and credit ratings, NextEra Energy is uniquely positioned to drive long term shareholder value, and we remain intensely focused on executing on these opportunities. Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners. The NEP portfolio performed well and delivered financial results in line with our expectations after accounting for below normal wind resource. Yesterday, the NEP board declared a quarterly distribution of $48.25 per common unit or $1.93 per common unit on an annualized basis up 15% from a year earlier. Inclusive of this increase, NEP has grown its distribution per unit by nearly 160% since IPO. During the quarter, NextEra Energy Partners announced an agreement to acquire a geographically diverse portfolio of six wind and solar projects from NextEra. Energy Resources. The approximately 600 megawatts of projects, which have a weighted average contract life of 15 years, and a counterparty credit rating of A2 [ph] and A at S&P, further diversify NEP’s existing portfolio. Upon completion, the acquisition combined with an associated recapitalization of existing NEP assets is expected to enable NEP to complete the growth necessary to achieve our previously outlined year-end 2019 run rate expectations even after excluding the PG&E related projects cash flows. These transactions are expected to be financed with a $900 million convertible equity portfolio financing, which I will discuss in more detail in a moment, as well as existing NEP debt capacity. Let me now review the detailed results for NEP. First quarter adjusted EBITDA of $225 million and cash available for distribution of $47 million were generally in line with our expectations after accounting for the weak wind resource. The first quarter of 2018 presents a particularly challenging comparable quarter as both adjusted EBITDA and CAFD benefited from the $30 million acceleration of the note receivable related to the sale of our Jericho asset. In addition, the adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution contribution from existing assets was reduced by approximately $23 million and $22 million respectively as a result of the weak wind resource, which was 89% of the long term average, versus 105% in the first quarter of 2018. As noted, during our discussion around Energy Resources results, we have confidence in our long term resource assumptions, and expect to continue to experience both positive and negative quarterly variability. For the balance of 2019, based on the shape of the contributions from the recently divested and acquired assets, we expect most of an NEP’s growth in adjusted EBITDA and CAFD to be in the second half of the year. At the end of the first quarter, approximately $38 million of cash distributions for PG&E related projects including Desert Sunlight 250, which is contracted with Southern California Edison were restricted as a result of events of defaults under the financing that arose due to PG&E bankruptcy filing. PG&E continues to make payments under all of our contracts for post-petition energy deliveries and we continue to pursue all options to protect our interests, including vigorously defending our contracts, and working with key stakeholders of each financing. Additional details of our first quarter results are shown on the accompanying slide. As I previously mentioned, we continue to execute on our plan to expand NEP’s portfolio with the acquisition from NextEra Energy Resources that we announced during the quarter. NEP expects to acquire the unlevered portfolio for total consideration of $1.02 billion subject to working capital and other adjustments. The acquisition is expected to close later this quarter and contribute adjusted EBITDA of approximately $100 million to $115 million and cash available for distribution of approximately $97 million to $107 million, each on an annual run rate basis as of December 31, 2019. Following the acquisition, these assets will be combined with 581 megawatts of existing NEP wind assets into a new portfolio. The $220 million of existing project debt on the current NEP assets is expected to be immediately paid down, creating significant benefits for NEP including being net present value, distribution per unit, and credit accretive as well as generating roughly $25 million in incremental CAFD. To finance the new acquisition and debt recapitalization of the existing assets, NEP will utilize the proceeds from a $900 million convertible equity portfolio financing with KKR as well as existing debt capacity. The KKR financing will have an initial, effective annual coupon of less than 1% and provide an EP with the flexibility to periodically buy out KKR’s equity interest at a fixed 8.3% pre-tax return inclusive of all prior distributions between the 3.5 year and 6 year anniversaries of the agreement. NEP will have the right to pay a minimum of 70% of the buyout price in NEP common units, issued at no discount to the then current market price. This transaction further demonstrates NEP’s continued ability to access attractive sources of capital to finance its growth while providing third party confirmation of NEP’s long term outlook and high quality portfolio. Relative to the initial convertible equity portfolio financing transaction that we executed with BlackRock in 2018, this financing will have several features that further enhance the value for NEP unit holders. With a lower initial coupon, more cash will be available to LP unit holders allowing NEP to acquire fewer assets to achieve the same level of future distribution growth. If NEP acquires fewer assets, it will have lower future financing needs. As a result, following the transaction, we believe NEP will be well positioned to meet its long term financial expectations without the need to sell common equity until 2021 at the earliest other than modest sales under the at the market program. In addition to reduced future equity needs, NEP will retain the flexibility to convert the pending KKR portfolio financing into common units at no discount over a longer period of time. This should be accretive to NEP unit holders who retain all of the unit price upside as NEP executes on its expected distribution growth objectives. Additionally, NEP will maintain significant option value on the underlying portfolio of assets while also preserving debt capacity and balance sheet flexibility. Upon successfully executing the transaction that we announced last quarter, NextEra Energy Partners expects to achieve its 2019 growth objectives assuming no cash is available from the PG&E related projects. Excluding all contributions from these projects, NextEra Energy Partners continues to expect a year end 2019 run rate for CAFD in the range of $410 million to $480 million, reflecting the calendar year 2020 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at the end of 2019. If PG&E related cash distributions were included, year-end 2019 CAFD expectations would be in the range of $485 million to $555 million. Year-end 2019 run rate adjusted EBITDA expectations, which assume for contributions from projects related to PG&E as revenue is expected to continue to be recognized, remain unchanged at $1.2 billion to $1.375 billion. From a base of our fourth quarter 2018 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $1.86 per common unit, we see 12% to 15% per year growth in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2023 subject to our usual caveats. Additionally, following the transactions, transaction announced earlier this quarter NEP announced its intention to grow its 2019 distribution at 15% resulting in an annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2019 distribution that is payable in February 2020 to be at least $2.14 per common unit. Our ability to continue to grow distributions at the top end of our expectations range for 2019 despite the PG&E related headwind is reflective of NEP’s market leading position and our continued focus on delivering value for LP unit holders. NEP continues to maintain flexibility to grow in three ways; through organic growth, third party acquisitions or through acquisitions from NextEra Energy Resources, providing clear visibility into its future growth prospects. Energy Resources currently has nearly 21 gigawatts of projects it could sell to NEP including its existing operating renewable assets and its backlog of projects it intends to build over the coming years. Additionally, despite the recent challenges related to PG&E, during the quarter NEP demonstrated its ability to access extremely low cost financings to support its growth. With continued financing flexibility, a strong base of underlying assets, a favorable tax position, and enhanced governance rights, NEP is well positioned to meet its growth expectations. We remain focused on continuing to execute and creating value for LP unit holders going forward. In summary, both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners are benefiting from our history of strong execution that has positioned us well to capitalize on the terrific growth opportunities available to us across our businesses. We look forward to sharing more detail with you at our investor conference on June 20th. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that we will open up the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] At this time we'll pause momentarily to assemble our roster. And we will take our first question from Stephen Byrd at Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Stephen Byrd: Hi, good morning.
Rebecca Kujawa: Good morning, Stephen.
Stephen Byrd: Wanted to talk about Resources, you continue to put up impressive growth numbers there. I noticed BOT build-own-transfer continues to show up. Would you mind just talking at a high level in terms of trends, with respect to BOT, do you see a trend in that direction, is this more just what you expected it's going to be a part of the mix, but not a not a growing trend? What are you seeing in terms of the BOT side of the market?
Rebecca Kujawa: Stephen, as you know, we've seen the tremendous growth in our renewables opportunities across the board, and we have historically benefited from sales to IOU customers, munis and co-ops, as well as a growing demand from C&I customers. Two of those groups, the munis and co-ops, as well as the C&I customers, generally are not that interested in build-own-transfers or owning the renewable assets. They are very happy to take advantage of all of the advantages that we bring to the table, including of our cost of capital, our scale, our ability to construct and deliver these projects, and ultimately operate them over the long-term at a low price. Our IOU customers are increasingly building renewables and wanting to procure and incorporate more into their portfolios. So, as the pie has gotten bigger, there is probably a nominal number of megawatts that are increasing in terms of build-own-transfers, and our team has been able to successfully offer to our customers a multitude of benefits to them of bringing a very -- all of the advantages that we bring to them and sell, part of it is build-own-transfer, and typically part of it is a PPA to them, bringing a total package that is very valuable to our customers. So, it's increasing, but very positive addition to our portfolio. John might add some more.
John Ketchum: Yes, Steven this is John. What I would add to that is the way I look at BOT is it enables more contracts. So the BOT that you saw this quarter was the Portland General transaction, where we had you know a trifecta of wind and solar with battery storage and the BOT was part of the wind facility that we actually ended up building, but we got a contract back for the other piece of it. And that's typically the type of BOT transaction that you'll see us enter into. But it is -- it is a part of the business and it's an enablement for more contracted origination around the renewable portfolio.
Stephen Byrd: Understood. So it's a two on two kit. You earn good returns on an as part of the solution you offered to some customers, so I understood. And wanted to shift over to SolarTogether. This is a really interesting model and Rebecca you mentioned briefly to the savings to customers, would you mind just speaking a little bit to this? It does seem like a like a nice model to offer Solar to your customers. I just want to make sure I understood the, what you had mentioned I think on the $1.8 billion cost. I think you mentioned $139 million of savings. Could you just talk through that a little bit more in terms of the benefits to customers from SolarTogether?
Rebecca Kujawa: Yes. So as you might expect, we've long been excited about deploying more solar in Florida. It is the Sunshine State and as solar has gotten to be more cost effective, we're very excited about bringing it to our -- across our entire portfolio. And there's certain amount of interest from our C&I customers who don't necessarily want to take on the ownership and construction responsibility particularly when it's not at scale and not as cost competitive as what we can build. And so when we went out and offered up this idea of a community solar program, we got a significant amount of interest from our large C&I customers, which is primarily the group that we went out to talk to you and that was the 1,100 megawatts of initial demand for this pre-registration period that we offered up. And so then we sized our program to be around 1,500 megawatts. So in the layout of the program, customers that sign up for this, the voluntary participation will pay a certain amount on their bill in the near term and over the long term will receive credits against their bill, but about 25%, 20%, 25% of the savings. The net savings to the overall system are actually going to be retained by the non-participating customers. So FPL’s existing customers will get a benefit from this program as well.
Stephen Byrd: That's helpful. Thanks so much.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Steve Fleishman at Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Steve Fleishman: Yes, hi good morning. Hopefully you can hear me. Okay.
Rebecca Kujawa: We can hear you fine, Steve. Good morning.
Steve Fleishman: Okay, great. So just could you maybe give a little more color on the MVP comments with respect to just more color and also what would be driving an update soon as opposed to like now for the Analyst Day?
Rebecca Kujawa: So as I mentioned in the in the prepared remarks, we along with everybody else were certainly disappointed by the Circuit Court not taking up the en banc review. And as soon as you know the initial adverse decision was made, we started working closely with our partners on a variety of different options whether it's legislative administrative etcetera to resolve the issues so that we can continue to build and ultimately bring online MVP. And we remain confident that you know one of those many options will ultimately come together so that we can put MVP into service, which at this point we think will be even more valuable than what we originally thought just because of the challenges that building pipelines in this area has proven to be. But at this point, looking at what we previously targeted for our in-service date of year-end 2019 that's challenging. So we're still working on what exactly the path forward is and the timing for COD. We are going to resume construction. As you know we temporarily you know paused construction during kind of tone down construction during the winter period just for the overall conditions, as we're starting to get to the spring, we’ll resume construction where we can. And then as we firm up plans, it's clear which of these options will come to fruition and we'll give you more specifications in terms of timing and ultimate cost.
James Robo: Steve, this is Jim. We certainly have both a date and a cost for you at the listing.
Steve Fleishman: Okay. And then also could you talk a little bit more about the underground in legislation and just what the investment opportunity and customer benefit is there?
Rebecca Kujawa: Sure. I'll start and I'll probably hand it over to Eric to add some more details. As everyone is well aware after the devastating impacts in our service territory from Irma, and then broader in Florida from Michael and other hurricanes. It became clear to a lot of critical stakeholders about how important it is to have continuous service for our customers. As you probably know, Florida is now a trillion dollar annual economy. So I think it's something like the 16th largest economy in the world if we were our own economy. So every day that we’re off line is a significant harm to our state. And so there's an appreciation from critical stakeholders in the legislature and other communities about the value of resiliency in our grid. And one of the ways that we can you know improve the resiliency is through some undergrounding. So there's some legislation going through the current session in Florida for the possibility of setting up a separate clause that ultimately we could recover investments and earn a return on for undergrounding our service territory through a clause mechanism.
Eric Silagy: Hi Steve, this is Eric Silagy. I guess the only thing I’ll add on this is that the legislation has progressed through both the Senate and the House pretty well, it's gone through six different committees, three in the House, three in the Senate, it's passed out of all those committees unanimously. So to date, there hasn't been a single no vote against it, in either body. There are some slight differences in the versions, so those have to be reconciled. It's not really subsidize [ph] and it's more of a verbiage, but we expect it to be taken up by the full House, the full Senate in the coming next week or so two weeks to the most, till the end of the session. And if it passes, then indications are that the government will be supportive as well. And there is a huge focus on resiliency in the state as Rebecca talked about, and frankly we've worked very hard over the past couple of years, with a couple of pilot programs to look at how do we get costs out of underground. And we've gotten it now to the point where and particularly under a programmatic approach, we'd be able to get the cost to be equal if not even a little better than some of the hardening efforts that we do aboveground. That's a real win for customers, both financially as well as obviously resiliency.
Steve Fleishman: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Shahriar Pourreza at Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.
Shahriar Pourreza: Hey good morning guys.
Rebecca Kujawa: Good morning.
Shahriar Pourreza: So just let me, just ask a quick question a couple here, but around Santee Cooper. There's obviously a lot of mixed data points we're seeing with lawmakers. The town hall meetings seem to be a little bit noisy and we kind of still have two competing bills. And then on the other hand, the process seems to be much more competitive than we all thought, so maybe a quick status update regarding the process. Are we still expecting some sort of closure in a decision by the June timeframe?
Rebecca Kujawa: So maybe I'll start off with the typical caveats that I think are an appropriate response to the question. And if maybe Jim wants to add something specific, I’ll toss it to him. But as you know, we typically don't comment on M&A activity other than very general comments that we look for opportunities where there's a constructive regulatory environment. It's accretive. And ultimately there's a good fit from our business perspective including opportunity to deploy the Florida Playbook, and being able to improve customer value proposition for our customers. I don’t know Jim if you want add some specific comments.
James Robo: So obviously we've confirmed that we put a bid in for Santee. And there is a process going on. I would expect it to come to conclusion here by June. And we will see how it plays out. I think, I think the state realizes that they know that Santee has upwards of $4 billion to $5 billion of debt for you know on asset there you know the nuclear plant that is never going to generate any income. And so, it's an issue for the state that they need to address. And I think the vast majority of folks in the state understand that they need to address it. And the key stakeholders are I think working hard to come to a conclusion about how the process is going to move forward. So you know we're cautiously optimistic that they bring you know that the legislature passes something to lay out what the process will be and then then we'll see. As I said, we did confirm in the last call that we put a bid in, and you can imagine that we'll continue to play in the process. And it's someplace where we think we can, we can add a lot of value and bring value to customers and bring value to economic development in the state.
Shahriar Pourreza: Got it. Got it. And just a quick update on Gulf Power, you're sort of five months into it. It seems like you're still kind of reiterating the $0.15 to $0.20 of accretion despite Gulf already contributing $0.08 in the quarter. Are you starting to see some incremental near-term opportunities to your prior stated accretion guide or is there something you'll update at the Analyst Day?
Rebecca Kujawa: Well, a couple of comments on Gulf. First, a high level maybe taking more of the second part of your question, first. We obviously closed at the very beginning of this year and we are as enthusiastic as ever about the opportunities with Gulf as we were prior to closing the acquisition. I personally spent time up there I know many of the other folks on the senior team and obviously we have a terrific team at Gulf now executing, and that's both taking cost out of the business as well as identifying the smart capital investments, which will ultimately deliver on the value proposition that we've been targeting with FPL, which is low bills, high reliability, terrific customer services and clean energy. So very optimistic and excited about it. More specifically to the numbers. Yes, you're correct on the $0.08, but as you know we're going to highlight the Gulf contributions as its own entity, and then for the financing costs, the financing costs to close the acquisition are showing up at CNL. So you might want to think about those two together. We do have opportunities to further improve the cost position through the balance of the year. We'll also start to ramp up the capital investments. Now as I talked about, we're planning to deploy a total of $700 million for the full year at Gulf and then obviously there's some ROE improvement that I talked about in the prepared remarks as well. Our guidance expectations remained from the overall company perspective as we talked about of our 6% to 8% growth from our 2018 adjusted EPS of $7.70 in 2019. And then we expect to have the incremental accretion on top of that growth rate of $0.15 in 2020 and $0.20 in 2021.
Shahriar Pourreza: Got it. And then lastly, Rebecca just you mentioned administrative options with MVP. Can you confirm if you're working with the ACP owners around this option? Like what stated -- obviously they are completely different projects, but what how much collaborating are you doing with the ACP owners like Dominion, especially when...
Rebecca Kujawa: I don't want to talk through really the details of that. As we've -- as I talked about a couple of minutes ago, we worked very closely with our partners to develop different options and we do believe there are various options in order to complete it, but we don't really think that it's to our advantage to get through a lot of the details of that out publicly. So, we're working on it very hard. We remain confident in our ability to ultimately construct and bring it into service.
Shahriar Pourreza: Great. Thanks, guys.
Rebecca Kujawa: Thank you.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead, sir.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning. Can you hear me?
Rebecca Kujawa: Good morning, Julien. We can hear you fine.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. All right. So at this point, I think perhaps a couple of clarifications. Perhaps starting with the last question, on Gulf, just to go back to what you were saying about your expectations on earned ROEs already pretty healthy, how do you think about the timeline to go back in for a formal rate case? And then also perhaps the prospects of getting an amortization type mechanism eventually. I mean, certainly that would be one of the multiple priorities, I would imagine in contemplating any kind of rate recovery. But at the same time, given the ability to earn within the band clearly the upper end already, how do you think that timeline?
Rebecca Kujawa: So we're still at the early stages, Julien. We closed it a couple of months ago. And right now the teams head is very much into identifying the cost, saving the opportunities putting the -- dot the I's and crossing the T's on the capital initiatives that we can make, and we're putting those plans together. For now I'd like to limit it to the comments that we made in the script and the prepared remarks that we expect to be at the upper half of the ROE band, and we expect to target the capital investment opportunities of a total of $700 million in 2019. And then to the extent that we can put more detail around that, particularly around the capital initiatives, we'll highlight more of those at the June Investor Conference.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Totally appreciated. And then secondly, if you can just coming back to you started the Q&A on the backlog here, it seems like another shift in backlog seems to be longer-dated beyond the 2020 period. If you look at what was added, it seems like the bulk of it for this quarter was added and the bulk of it -- that was solar. Can you comment a little bit about the economics of solar in the backlog as you move through time in 2019 and 2020 versus the 2020 onwards type projects? And then perhaps any other nuances you might see in terms of safe harboring or otherwise in the 2020 onwards type time frame?
Rebecca Kujawa: I think there are a couple of comments in there, Julien. So you'll have to correct me if I don't hit all of them. But in terms of the timing of the backlog, as you know, we set out expectations at our last Investor Conference for the full 2017 through 2020 time frame. We're now healthily in those ranges, which sets us up very well to deliver on the expectations that we've long talked to you all about. And as we highlighted in the script today, we now have the 2,700 megawatts of projects that are beyond 2020. I mean that's actually building up over time and there is actually one or two projects that moved from the -- before 2021 time frame into 2021. We're starting to see customers shift, their focus to beyond 2020. I wouldn't say that the team has stopped the efforts to sign contracts for 2020 COD, and in fact, I'm sure John will tell you that he is pushing his team hard and no doubt customers continue to be interested in signing up wind projects before the end of 2020. But of course, with solar still having the technical benefits, tax incentives into the early 2020s, customers are certainly focusing on that as well. To answer the return question, our returns as we long talked about has generally remained consistent on a levered basis over time. And that hasn't changed materially in recent weeks or months.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Right. All right. Excellent. Well, we can leave it there. Thank you very much again.
JamesRobo: Hey, Julien. This is Jim. The only other thing I would add to your -- as you can imagine we are safe harboring for 2021 and beyond. So we're not taking advantage of that opportunity.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Right. You should assume everything safe harbored.
James Robo: Correct.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Exactly. All right. Excellent.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our next question from Jonathan Arnold at Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Arnold: Good morning, guys, and thank you.
Rebecca Kujawa: Good morning.
Jonathan Arnold: Could I just ask on the -- the subject of BOT and the backlog, and it just seem you've had situations where you are adding BOT to the backlog, and then others where you -- including last quarter where you didn't. What's the trigger to determine whether BOT is shown in backlog or not?
Rebecca Kujawa: Yes, typically if there are some sort of operating agreement, whether it is ongoing economic value to us then we have decided to include it in our backlog, where the transaction is really focused more on a build and to resale and then the operations and all ongoing economics or to the customers benefit, we've excluded it.
Jonathan Arnold: Okay. And so...
John Ketchum: Yes. So, Jonathan, this is John. So the contracts that's BOT this quarter again is related to Portland General. So 300-megawatt wind facility, 100 megawatts BOT, 200-megawatt is the balance that we will own under a contract. And so that facility is going to be -- the whole 300 megawatts is going to be operated by us, I'm sorry, got that backwards 200 megawatts is the piece, that's the BOT, and 100 megawatt is piece that we take back.
Jonathan Arnold: Okay. So that makes sense. But then, for example, say the 200 megawatts BOT project that you announced on the fourth quarter call, was that something different? And then would that -- is that we shouldn't anticipate that would end up in backlog or should we?
John Ketchum: No, no. That would not be in backlog. And just to clarify, we got 100 megawatts of BOT, and right with Portland General, 200 megawatts under contract.
Jonathan Arnold: Yes, this is all that Wheatridge, correct, to see that in the...
John Ketchum: That's all Wheatridge.
Jonathan Arnold: And then there's the solar piece as well.
John Ketchum: There's the solar piece as well and the battery storage.
Jonathan Arnold: The storage piece. Yeah, Okay, I got it. Thank you for that. And then just on one -- an another topic. And if we -- as we're thinking about what to anticipate at the Analyst Day, and then we talked about at some point you might sort of start talking more around profitability metrics on backlog and as opposed to just megawatts. Is that something that you think might be part of the update or is still work in progress?
Rebecca Kujawa: Jonathan, it is very much a work in progress. I think the general outline should be somewhat consistent with what we've talked about in the past, which is overviews of our -- basically putting meat to the bone, you're helping you understand with the growth opportunities are for each of our businesses. Obviously for the first time at Gulf Power, we detailed plans on how we're looking at the business and what the opportunities are. At Energy Resources, we certainly -- it's likely we will put together an overview of the renewables marketed as we see it today, to help you see some of the details of why our team continues to be excited about renewable economics, and ultimately demand from our customers that will enable us to continue to grow our business.
Jonathan Arnold: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: And we will take our final question from Michael Lapides at Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Michael Lapides: Hey guys, thank you for taking my questions. Just curious, a lot going on in Florida these days, and this maybe one for Eric. How are you guys thinking about a handful of items, one is the outstanding petition or complaint regarding tax reform implementation in the last FP&L kind of rate review? The other is I think, there's still some litigation outstanding or challenge regarding implementation of the SoBRA mechanism. And then finally, just curious is there anything that has to happen or anything that could happen that could derail the two-year extension of the existing rate agreement you have?
Eric Silagy: Yes. Hey, Michael, it's Eric. So, let me start with the tax reform docket. We've had -- we recently had hearings over it and filed testimony, there's going to be additional hearings that take place in mid-May. Look, we feel very good about our position, and how it fits within our rate agreement. Our arguments are solid and sound. It's a proceeding, we will go through it. But I feel very good about where we stand overall from the tax reform position. Other areas, obviously as you know we've got -- the Irma docket is still out there too, that's going to be in mid-June. Again feel very good about that. That was a storm that we actually restored more people faster than anybody in history, and we paid for using our tax savings to reserve amortization. So, I feel very good about our positions in Florida Public Service Commission. I can't predict who's going to oppose what and when they're going to file for hearings. But right now, the arguments have been strong and the hearings have gone well so far.
Michael Lapides: Got it. Thanks, Eric.
Rebecca Kujawa: And Michael, I shall add to Eric's comments as you referenced to the -- you're going in for a rate case. As we talked about both in the script, and obviously in prior comments, tax reform enabled us to potentially have a two-year extension of our settlement agreement, and that obviously the benefit of delaying any amount of time is further delaying the time where we'd need a base rate increase from our customers, so hopefully saving the customers some money. But it's up to two years, and we'll have to go through the thought process as we typically do about when is the best time to go in and looking at all of our costs and our forecast about when do we need some incremental revenues.
Michael Lapides: Got it. But there's nothing mandating you to come in at any point in time. It's up to -- it's kind of an FP&L or NextEra decision on when to come in?
Rebecca Kujawa: Well as you know, under the settlement agreement, we need to notify the commission in March of 2020, if we intend to come in within the next year time frame after that.
Eric Silagy: Right. So Michael, the settlement takes us through 2020, through the end of 2020, we have to notify if we choose to extend, but it is our choice to unilateral decision, and we'll do that by March of 2020, and as Rebecca said, it could be up to two years is what we've been saying.
Michael Lapides: Got it. Thank you, Eric and Rebecca. Much appreciated.
Operator: This will conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2018 Q4  (2019-01-25 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the NextEra Energy Inc. and NextEra Energy Partners LP Q4 and Full Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, this event is being recorded. And now, I would now like to turn the conference over to Matt Roskot, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Matthew Roskot : Thank you, Kathy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2018 combined earnings conference call for NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. With me this morning are Jim Robo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; John Ketchum, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; Armando Pimentel, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources; and Mark Hickson, Executive Vice President of NextEra Energy, all of whom are also officers of NextEra Energy Partners, as well as Eric Silagy, President and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light Company.  Jim will provide some opening remarks and we will then turn the call over to John for a review of our fourth quarter and full year results.  We will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call, in the Risk Factors section of the accompanying presentation, on our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found on our websites, nexteraenergy.com and nexteraenergypartners.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. Today's presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of historical non-GAAP measures to the closest GAAP financial measure. With that, I will turn the call over to Jim
James Robo: Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. As John will detail later in the call, 2018 was a terrific year for both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. By successfully executing on our plans at both FPL and Energy Resources, NextEra Energy was able to achieve our target 2018 adjusted EPS of $7.70, an increase of approximately 15% over our 2017 results.  Dating back to 2005, we’ve now delivered compound annual growth and adjusted EPS of over 8.5% which is the highest among all top ten power companies who have achieved on average compound annual growth of roughly 3% over the same period.  We delivered a total shareholder return of over 14% in 2018, outperforming the S&P 500 by nearly 19% and the S&P 500 Utilities Index by more than 10%. Since 2005, we have outperformed 86% of the S&P 500 and 100% of the other companies in the S&P 500 Utilities Index while continuing to outperform both indices in terms of total shareholder return on a one, three, five, seven and ten year basis.  We are once again honored to be named for the 12th time in 13 years number one in the Electric and Gas Utilities Industry on Fortune’s list of world’s most admired companies and to be among the top 25 of Fortune’s 2018 Change The World list.  During 2018, FPL successfully executed on its ongoing capital plan including the continuation of one of the largest solar expansions ever in the U.S. and achieved its O&M efficiency targets to further improve its already best-in-class customer value proposition.  As a result of continued smart investments to benefit our customers, FPL’s typical residential bill is more than 30% below the national average, the lowest of all 54 electric providers in the State of Florida and nearly 10% below the level it was in 2006.  In addition to low bills, FPL delivered its best ever service reliability performance in 2018 and was recognized for the third time in four years as being the most reliable electric utility of the nation. Throughout the year, we were fortunate to be in a position to assist other utilities across the country in the recovery from natural disasters and we remain grateful for the support that others have given us over the years. After a nearly ten year process, last month FPL closed on the purchase of the City of Vero Beach's municipal electric system. We look forward to extending FPL’s value proposition to Vero Beach’s approximately 35,000 customers while also generating significant long-term savings for FPL’s existing customers.  The benefit to both new and existing customers is reflective of FPL’s collaborative efforts with city, local and regional leaders, as well as other state authorities to find the best outcome for all stakeholders.  Earlier this month, we were pleased to close on the purchase of Gulf Power and excited to welcome our new colleagues to the NextEra Energy family. We’ve now successfully completed all three transactions with Southern Company that we announced in the middle of last year.  The acquisitions are an excellent complement to our existing operations and further expand NextEra Energy’s regulated business mix through the addition of attractive electric and natural gas franchises. By executing on the same long-term strategy that we deployed at FPL, we expect the acquisitions to benefit customers, shareholders and the Florida economy.  The Energy Resources team also continued its long track record of strong execution in 2018. The renewable origination success was particularly strong as the team added approximately 6500 megawatts including storage and repowering to our backlog over the past year. This represents the most successful origination year in our history and is nearly twice as many megawatts as we originated in 2017 our prior record year.  Our ongoing renewable origination success results from operating in what we believe to be the best renewable development environment in our history and our ability to leverage Energy Resource’s competitive advantages.  These competitive advantages include our best-in-class development skills, strong customer relationships, purchasing power, best-in-class construction expertise, resource assessment capabilities, strong access to in cost of capital advantages and the ability to combine wind, solar and battery storage and to integrate its [indiscernible] low cost products.  During the year, we were pleased to receive the IRS start of construction guidance on the Solar ITC which we believe positions us well for substantial solar and storage growth well into the next decades. In 2018, more than 40% of the solar projects that were added to our backlog included a battery storage component highlighting the beginning of the next phase of renewables development that pairs low cost wind and solar energy with a low cost battery storage solution.  With continued technology improvements and cost declines, we expect that without incentives wind is going to be a $0.02 to $0.025 per kilowatt hour product and solar is going to be a $0.025 to $0.03 per kilowatt hour product early in the next decade.  Combining these extremely low costs with the one half to three quarter cent adder for a four hour storage system will create a [indiscernible] renewable generation resource that is cheaper than the operating cost of coal, nuclear and [lesser] [ph] fuel-efficient oil and gas-fired generation units.  We continue to believe that this will be massively disruptive to the nation’s generation fleet and create significant opportunities for renewable growth well into the next decade. Consistent with our focus on growing our rate regulated and long-term contracted business operations, during the fourth quarter, NextEra Energy Transmission announced an agreement to acquire Trans Bay Cable, a 53 mile, high-voltage direct current underwater transmission cable system with utility rates set by FERC which provides approximately 40% of San Francisco’s daily electric power needs.  Subject to regulatory approval, the approximately $1 billion acquisition including the assumption of debt is expected to close later this year and to be immediately accretive to earnings. The proposed acquisition, combined with the Mid-Continent independent system operator selection of NextEra Energy Transmission to develop the approximately 20 mile, single circuit 500 KV Hartburg-Sabine Junction transmission line in East Texas furthers our goal of creating America’s leading competitive transmission company.  In addition to successfully growing our regulated operations both organically and through acquisitions during 2018, we further strengthened Energy Resources’ existing portfolio during the year. In December, the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection selected approximately 20% of the Seabrook nuclear plant’s generation and 80 megawatts of new solar projects which are not yet included in our backlog for long-term contracts.  By operating one of the top performing nuclear plants in the nation, Energy Resources expects to provide significant amounts of carbon-free energy at prices generally in line with current forward curves while generating attractive shareholder returns. As a result, Seabrook’s contract pricing is expected to be roughly 50% lower than the cost of offshore wind generating significant savings for Connecticut customers over the eight year contract term.  The Seabrook award complements Energy Resources’ exit of the merchant business which we began back in 2011 and essentially completed in 2016 with the sale of our Forney, Lamar and Marcus Hook natural gas generation assets. Excluding Seabrook, the remaining merchant generation assets contribute less than 1% of NextEra Energy’s consolidated adjusted EBITDA.  Going forward, we expect this contribution to decline as the focus remains on regulated and long-term contracted opportunities in renewables, natural gas pipelines and regulated transmission.  As always, we will continue to opportunistically evaluate recycling capital through sales of non-strategic assets in our portfolio including the remaining fossil generation assets to fund the additional growth of the long-term contracted businesses.  As a result of increasing the expected adjusted earnings contribution from rate regulated businesses to 70% and the steps that we have taken to further de-risk the Energy Resources portfolio, S&P announced earlier this month that they have revised the reassessment of NextEra Energy’s business-rich profile upward from strong to excellent.  As a result of this improvement, S&P reduced NextEra Energy’s FFO-to-debt downgrade threshold from 23% to 21%. This follows Moody’s announcement last year that with the expansion of the company’s regulated operations to roughly 70% following the Gulf Power transaction, NextEra Energy’s CFO pre-working capital-to-debt downgrade threshold would be reduced from 20% to 18%.  At these revised rating agency thresholds and following some utilization of balance sheet capacity for t he Trans Bay Transmission acquisition, we now expect to maintain $4 billion to $6 billion of excess balance sheet capacity through 2021. While we have multiple alternatives for utilization, we expect to use approximately $2 billion of this capacity in the near-term to support additional regulated capital investments at FPL.  Consistent with the significant incremental smart investment opportunities that exist at FPL, last week, we announced FPL’s groundbreaking 30-by-30 plan to install more than 30 million solar panels by 2030 resulting in an incremental 10,000 megawatts of solar projects versus what is in operation in FPL today.  We will give further details on these and other potential investments which are mostly expected to help maintain on a long-term adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate beyond 2021 at our investor conference which we plan to hold on June 20 in New York City.  Following the strong results from 2018, I continue to believe that we have one of the best organic opportunity sets and execution track records in the industry. I remain as enthusiastic as ever about our long-term prospects and based on the strength and diversity of our underlying businesses, I will be disappointed if we were not able to deliver financial results at or near the top-end of our 6% to 8% compound annual growth rate range in 2021, plus the expected deal accretion from the Florida transactions while at the same time maintaining our strong credit ratings.  Let me now turn to NEP which also had a terrific year of execution in 2018. As John will describe later in the call, NEP successfully delivered on its growth objectives for adjusted EBITDA, CAFD and LP distributions. During the year, we recycled the proceeds from the sale of NEP’s Canadian portfolio into a higher yielding U.S. portfolio that benefits from a more favorable tax position.  As a result of this accretive transaction, NEP extended its expectations for 12% to 15% per year DPU growth by one additional year to 2023. The 1.4 gigawatt renewable portfolio that was acquired from Energy Resources further enhanced the diversity of NEP’s existing portfolio and was financed through a combination of the Canadian asset sale proceeds and a $750 million convertible equity portfolio financing with Blackrock. The financing demonstrates NEP’s ability to access additional low-cost sources of capital to finance its growth and with the right to convert a minimum of 70% of the portfolio financing into NEP units issued at no discount, the transaction further reduces NEP’s equity needs going forward.  NEP grew the LP distribution by 15% year-over-year and delivered a total unitholder return of approximately 4% in 2018 which is on the heels of a total unitholder return of over 75% the year prior. NEP outperformed both the S&P 500 and the other YieldCos by 7% on average and its total unitholder return was more than 15% higher than the Alerian MLP Index.  I continue to believe that the combination of NEP’s growth visibility along with its flexibility to finance that growth offer unitholders an attractive – offer unitholders an attractive investor value proposition. For these reasons, NEP is well-positioned to continue executing on its growth objectives and delivering strong performance going forward.  Before turning the call over to John, I’d like to announce some important organizational changes. Armando Pimentel, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources and President and a member of the Board of Directors of NextEra Energy Partners will retire from each of his positions on March 1st of this year as part of a planned leadership succession process that began when Armando shared his plans with me more than a year ago.  John Ketchum currently Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy will replace Armando as President and Chief Executive Officer at NextEra Energy Resources. As part of John’s new responsibilities, he will continue to serve as a member of the Board of Directors of NEP and will be appointed President of NextEra Energy Partners.  Rebecca Kujawa, currently Vice President Business Management NextEra Energy Resources will succeed John as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy. Rebecca will also become a member of the Board of Directors of NEP. Each of these changes will become effective on March 1st of this year.  Armando has been an enormous contributor to NextEra Energy’s success during his more than ten years with the company helping to build an industry-leading business during his tenure as CEO of Energy Resources. His leadership, commercial judgment, financial discipline have all guided Energy Resources through a period of truly unprecedented growth in financial success. Armando’s contributions set the company on a path to become what it is today, the world’s leading renewable energy company. He has been a great friend, colleague and a truly valued counselor to me personally and it’s an understatement to say I’ll miss him. But I am also excited for Armando and what will come next for him and his family in retirement.  With regard to John’s promotion, I have had the chance to work closely with John for more than 16 years as he has successfully progressed through a variety of different roles in our company. We are fortunate to have a person of his capability, vision and experience.  He is an exceptional leader who has emerged as one of the premier CFOs in our sector and I have tremendous faith that John is the ideal successor to lead the Energy Resources team into the future due to a strong financial acumen, knowledge of the sector and passion for building a world leading-energy company.  Likewise, Rebecca has distinguished herself as well-rounded executive with a proven track record of execution, outstanding finance and commercial skills and an unparalleled understanding of NextEra Energy enterprise.  She has been instrumental and helping Armando lead Energy Resources and develop our strategy for NEP over the last several years and her innovative analytical and strategic mindset will serve us well in her new role. I am very happy to have Rebecca as our new Chief Financial Officer.  I’ll now turn the call over to Armando who would like to make some closing remarks. 
Armando Pimentel: Thank you, Jim. First I want to thank Jim for providing me the opportunity to lead Energy Resources for the last seven-and-a half years and I want to thank those of you on the phone today who I have had the privilege of meeting and interacting with since I began at NextEra Energy in 2008.  I thank you for the interactive dialogue and the opportunity to continue to tell our story and today there is no doubt that Energy Resources is not only the largest developer, operator and owner of renewable energy in the world, but also it’s most profitable and innovative. And as I tell our employees and customers, I believe we are just getting started.  I strongly believe that the renewable energy opportunity is actually just beginning. The combination of energy storage with wind and solar is a revolution which will expand the opportunities for renewable and is very exciting. I am profoundly comfortable in the continued success of Energy Resources, NextEra Energy Partners and NextEra Energy.  I want to thank all of our employees at NextEra Energy for providing me the opportunity to work alongside them. I have learned and lacked much over the years and will miss the innovative, fast-pace environment in which we work. I have no concrete plans as of now, but I am excited about pursuing new adventures and honing old skills.  At the very least retirement will allow me to pursue one of my great passions, fishing. Thanks again to all of you who have helped guide me and our company successfully over the years. Our company is in terrific shape and I congratulate and applaud John and Rebecca on their new roles, well deserved. I will now turn the call over to John. 
John Ketchum: Thank you, Armando and Jim. Let’s now turn to the detailed results beginning with FPL. For the fourth quarter of 2018, FPL reported net income of $407 million or $0.85 per share, up $0.01 per share, compared to FPL’s adjusted earnings in the prior year period.  For the full year 2018, FPL reported net income of $2.2 billion or $4.55 per share, an increase of $0.46 per share versus FPL’s adjusted earnings in 2017. Regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 12.4% for 2018 and was a principal driver of FPL's adjusted net income growth of 12.5% for the full year.  FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter bringing its full year investments to a total of roughly $5.1 billion. FPL’s reported ROE for regulatory purposes was 11.6% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, which is at the upper-end of the allowed band of 9.6% to 11.6% under our current rate agreement.  During the fourth quarter we restored an additional $240 million of reserve amortization leaving FPL with a year-end 2018 balance of $541 million. We continue to expect that FPL will end 2020 with a sufficient amount of reserve amortization to operate under the current base rate settlement agreement for up to two additional years creating further customer benefits by potentially avoiding a base rate increase in 2021 and perhaps 2022.  Before moving on, let me now take a moment to update you on some of our key capital initiatives at FPL. During 2018, FPL completed construction on schedule and on budget for the first eight 74.5 megawatt solar energy centers developed under the solar base rate adjustment or SoBRA mechanism of the rate case settlement agreement.  In 2018, we also deployed the first two projects under FPL’s 50 megawatt battery storage pilot program pairing battery systems with existing solar projects and highlighting FPL’s innovative approach to further enhance the diversity of its clean energy solutions for customers. The next 300 megawatts of solar projects being built under the SoBRA mechanism remain on budget and on track to begin providing cost-effective energy to FPL customers in early 2019.  To support the significant solar expansion that FPL is leading across Florida, we have secured sites that could potentially support more than 7 gigawatts of future projects. Beyond solar, construction on the approximately 1750 megawatt Okeechobee Clean Energy Center remains on budget and on schedule to enter service in the middle of this year. Additionally, the roughly 1200 megawatt Dania Beach Clean Energy Center received Siting Board approval during the quarter to support its projected commercial operation date in 2022. We continue to expect that FPL’s ongoing smart investment opportunities will support a compound annual growth rate and regulatory capital employed, net of accumulated deferred income taxes of approximately 9% from the start of the settlement agreement in January 2017 through at least December 2021, while further enhancing our customer value proposition.  The economy in Florida remains healthy. The current unemployment rate of 3.3% remains below the national average and at the lowest levels in a decade. Florida’s consumer confidence level remains near ten year highs. The real estate sector also continues to show strength with new building permits remaining at healthy levels and the Case-Shiller Index for South Florida home price is up 4.8% from the prior year.  FPL’s fourth quarter retail sales increased 4% from the prior year comparable period. We estimate that weather-related usage per customer contributed approximately 0.6% to this amount. On a weather-normalized basis, fourth quarter sales increased 3.4% with positive contributions from both weather-normalized usage per customer and ongoing customer growth including the addition of Vero Beach’s customers.  For 2018, we estimate that FPL’s retail sales on a weather-normalized basis increased by 2.6%. Continued customer growth and an estimated 1.7% increase and weather-normalized usage per customer both contributed favorably.  While we are encouraged by the growth in underlying usage in 2018, which was a consistent benefit during all four quarters as we have often discussed, this measure can be volatile and we are not yet ready to draw any firm conclusions about long-term trends. We will continue to closely monitor and analyze underlying usage and will update you on future calls.  Let me now turn to Energy Resources which reported fourth quarter 2018 GAAP earnings of $263 million or $0.55 per share. Adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter were $317 million or $0.66 per share. For the full year, Energy Resources reported GAAP earnings of $4.66 billion or $9.75 per share and adjusted earnings of $1.46 billion or $3.05 per share.  In the fourth quarter, Energy Resources contribution to adjusted earnings per share increased by $0.18 from the prior year comparable period. Positive contributions from new investments, customer supply and trading, our gas infrastructure business, including existing pipelines and the reduction in the corporate federal income tax rate, all supported the strong year-over-year growth.  These favorable contributions were partially offset by lower contributions from our existing generation assets as a result of particularly poor fleet-wide wind resource which was the lowest fourth quarter on record over the last 30 years and higher interest and corporate expenses due to growth in the business.  Energy Resources’ full year adjusted earnings per share contribution increased $0.45 or approximately 17% versus 2017. For the full year contributions from the new investments declined by $0.04 per share due in part to the expected smaller than usual 2017 renewable build.  In 2019 and beyond, we expect meaningful growth from new investments as we continue to execute on our renewables development backlog. Increased PTC volume from the approximately 1600 megawatts of repowered wind projects that were commissioned in 2017 helped increase contributions from existing generation assets by $0.10 per share.  Contributions from our gas infrastructure business including existing pipelines increased by $0.17 per share year-over-year. As expected, the reduction in the corporate federal income tax rate was accretive to Energy Resources increasing adjusted EPS by $0.45 compared to 2017.  All other impacts reduced results by $0.23 per share, primarily as a result of higher interest and corporate expenses driven largely by increased development activity to support the favorable renewables development environment. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide.  In 2018, Energy Resources continue to advance its position as a leading developer and operator of wind, solar and battery storage projects commissioning nearly 2700 megawatts of renewable projects in the U.S. including an additional 900 megawatts of repowered wind.  Since the last call, we have added 1791 megawatts of renewable projects to our backlog including 680 megawatts of wind, 797 megawatts of solar and 215 megawatts of battery storage, all of which will be paired with new solar projects.  Included in the solar megawatts, we added to backlog this quarter is a 150 megawatt solar build own transfer project with a 10 year O&M agreement that will allow the customer to leverage Energy Resources’ best-in-class operating skills while providing meaningful ongoing revenue through the contract term.  During the quarter, Energy Resources signed an additional 99 megawatts of wind repowering and successfully commissioned approximately 600 megawatts of repowering projects. For 2017 and 2018, this brings the total repowering projects placed in service to roughly 2500 megawatts near the top-end of the previously outlined range for this period.  We continue to expect to be on the upper half of $2.5 billion to $3 billion in total capital deployment for repowerings for 2017 through 2020. Following the record origination year in 2018, it was nearly two years remaining in the development period, we are now within the previously outlined 2017 to 2020 ranges for U.S. wind, solar and wind repowering.  For the post-2020 period, our backlog has already nearly 2000 megawatts placing us well ahead of our historical origination activity at this early stage. The accompanying slide provides additional detail on where our renewables development program now stands.  Beyond renewables we completed construction of approximately 175 miles of the Mountain Valley pipeline during 2018. As planned, MVP is continuing with its scale-back construction efforts for the winter.  While we continue to target our previously announced full-in service state for the pipeline during the fourth quarter of 2019 and revised overall project cost estimate of $4.6 billion, we also continue to work through the project’s outstanding legal challenges and to closely monitor developments related to the Atlanta Coast pipeline and the current government shutdown as the outcome of any one of these issues could impact MVP’s project schedule and cost estimates.  We also continue to evaluate mitigation alternatives to address potential adverse outcomes should they arise. MVP’s expected annual contribution to NextEra Energy’s ongoing adjusted EPS is approximately $0.07 to $0.09. We did not expect any material adjusted earnings impacts nor any change in NextEra Energy’s financial expectations as a result of the ongoing challenges. We will provide further updates as those proceedings evolve. Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy for the fourth quarter of 2018 GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $422 million or $0.88 per share. NextEra Energy’s 2018 fourth quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $718 million or $1.49 per share respectively. For the full year 2018, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $6.64 billion or $13.88 per share. Adjusted earnings were $3.67 billion or $7.70 per share reflecting growth of 15% off our 2017 adjusted EPS including an approximately $0.45 benefit from lower federal income taxes. For the Corporate and Other segment, adjusted earnings for the full year increased $0.09 per share compared to 2017 primarily due to lower interest and certain favorable tax items.   We continue to expect NextEra Energy’s adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate to be in a range of 6% to 8% through 2021 off our 2018 adjusted EPS of $7.70 plus accretion of $0.15 and $0.20 in 2020 and 2021 respectively from the Florida acquisitions.  For 2019, we continue to expect our adjusted EPS to be in the range of $8 to $8.50. From 2018 to 2021, we expect that operating cash flow will grow roughly in line with our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range.  We are closely following the recent developments with Pacific Gas and Electric. Projects directly affected by the potential PG&E bankruptcy have an expected annual adjusted EPS contribution of roughly $0.13 to $0.15 for NextEra Energy.  Regardless of the outcome of PG&E’s anticipated bankruptcy proceedings, we expect to achieve NextEra Energy’s adjusted EPS expectations that I just outlined and we’ll be disappointed if we are not able to deliver growth at or near the top of our 6% to 8% compound annual growth rate range off our 2018 base of $7.70, plus the expected deal accretion from the Florida transactions.  We continue to expect to grow our dividends per share 12% to 14% per year through at least 2020 off a 2017 base of dividends per share of $3.93. As always, our expectations are subject to the usual caveats including but not limited to normal weather and operating conditions.  Let me now turn to NEP which also had a strong year of operational and financial performance in 2018. Yesterday, the NEP Board declared a quarterly distribution of $46.50 per common unit or $1.86 per unit on an annualized basis, up 15% from the comparable quarterly distribution a year earlier and at the top end of the range we discussed going into 2018.  For the full year 2018, adjusted EBITDA and CAFD increased 18% and 36% respectively, primarily as a result of portfolio growth. In addition to meeting NEP’s growth objectives with the acquisition from Energy Resources, during 2018, we are also pleased to announce the execution of a long-term contract that enables an expansion investment in the Texas pipelines.  The opportunity was subject to regulatory approvals is expected to be in service during the fourth quarter of 2020 demonstrates the organic growth potential of NEP’s underlying portfolio. Beyond the attractive low-cost convertible portfolio equity financing with Blackrock, NEP took additional steps to further enhance its financing flexibility during 2018.  In the fourth quarter, NEP entered into an additional $1 billion interest rate hedge agreement to help mitigate interest rate volatility on future debt issuances. NEP’s hedge agreement has a fixed rate of approximately 3.95% and can be flexibly utilized in any date until December 11, 2028.  The swap is incremental to the $5 billion hedge agreement that we announced last year providing significant protection against interest rate risks and NEP executes on its long-term growth plans – as NEP executes on its long-term growth plans.  Additionally, during 2018, we successfully raised approximately $85 million through the sale of roughly 1.8 million common units under NEP’s ATM program. Going forward, we will continue to flexibly seek opportunities to use the ATM program depending on market conditions and other considerations.  Now let’s look at the detailed results. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $165 million and cash available for distribution was $44 million, a decrease of $35 million and $33 million from the prior year comparable quarter respectively. The decline was primarily driven by the sale of a Canadian portfolio earlier in the year with those assets not replaced until the late December closing on the 1.4 gigawatt acquisition from Energy Resources. For the full year 2018, adjusted EBITDA and CAFD were $881 million and $339 million, up 18% and 36% respectively, primarily driven by growth of the underlying portfolio. Existing projects benefited from increased contributions from Texas Pipelines versus the prior year.  For adjusted EBITDA, this benefit was offset by the year-over-year reduction and the pre-tax value of NEP’s tax credits as a result of a decline in the federal income tax rate.  This change has no impact on CAFD. Cash available for distribution from existing projects also benefited from reduced debt service which was roughly offset by higher corporate level interest expense. As reminder, these results include the impact of IDR fees which we treat as an operating expense. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide.  For NEP, absent any impact from a PGE bankruptcy filing, our December 31, 2018 runrate expectations for adjusted EBITDA of $1 billion to $1.15 billion and CAFD of $350 million to $400 million are unchanged reflecting calendar year 2019 expectations for the portfolio with which we ended the year. Our previously announced December 31, 2019 runrate expectations for adjusted EBITDA of $1.2 billion to $1.375 billion and CAFD of $410 million to $480 million are also unchanged.  Our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and include the impact of anticipated IDR fees as we treat these as an operating expense. From an updated base of our fourth quarter 2018 distribution per common unit on annualized rate of $1.86, we continue to see 12% to 15% per year growth in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2023.  We expect the annualized rate in the fourth quarter 2019 distribution that is payable in February 2020 to be in a range of $2.08 to $2.14 per common unit. NEP expects to be able to manage through the impacts of the anticipated PG&E bankruptcy and to achieve the growth expectations that I just outlined.  As we have previously disclosed, the 420 megawatts of projects that are contracted with PG&E represents 15% to 18% of NEP’s expected year-end 2018 runrate cash available for distribution.  As a result of the PG&E Board of Directors authorizing the commencement of a bankruptcy filing, we believe an event of default has likely occurred under the Genesis financing. The administrative agent for the Desert Sunlight 300 financing has notified us an event of default has occurred under those agreements which we dispute and they are currently withholding the January distribution.  For any financing or an event of default is determined to have occurred, cash distributions can be restricted and other remedies could be exercised including acceleration of the debt. Additionally, due to provisions in the financings an event of default under the Desert Sunlight 300 financing can’t prevent distribution from Desert Sunlight 250 which has contracted with SE. We expect the combination of Desert Sunlight 250 and the PG&E projects to contribute roughly 18% of NEP’s year-end 2019 runrate CAFD. As we execute on NEP’s growth strategy, we expect this to further decline over time and that the PG&E projects and Desert Sunlight 250 will not represent a significant percentage of NEP’s 2023 cash available for distribution. For projects or cash distributions are restricted, we expect that over time, these funds will go toward paying down the principal on existing financings, which would potentially result in more distributable cash flow to NEP in the future. In each of these projects, we are reviewing our alternatives and we’ll pursue all options to protect our interest including vigorously defending our contracts and working with key stakeholders of each financing.  Even in a worst case scenario, where we receive no further contributions from projects that are contracted with PG&E or Desert Sunlight 250, we continue to expect that NEP will achieve its annual 12% to 15% growth in distributions per unit through 2023 without the need to sell common equity until 2020 at the earliest of the modest at the market issuances.  We are pleased with NEP’s strong performance in 2018 and believe it continues to provide a best-in-class investor value proposition. With the flexibility to grow in three ways, acquiring assets from Energy Resources organically or acquiring assets from other third-parties, NEP has clear visibility to support its growth going forward.  Following a new record renewables origination year by Energy Resources and the continued strength of the best renewables development environment in our history, NEP’s growth visibility further improved in 2018. Additionally, NEP’s cost to capital and access to capital advantages further improved over the past year providing flexibility to finance its growth over the long-term.  When NEP’s growth potential and financing flexibility are combined with its favorable tax position and enhanced governance rights, we believe NEP is well-positioned to meet its financial expectations and we look forward to delivering on NEP’s strategic and growth initiatives in 2019 and beyond.  That concludes our prepared remarks and with that, we will open the line for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we will go first to Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley. 
Stephen Byrd : Hi, good morning. 
John Ketchum: Hi, good morning, Stephen. 
Stephen Byrd : Armando, congratulations on your retirement and John and Rebecca, congratulations on your new role. All very well deserved. 
John Ketchum: Thank you, Stephen.
Stephen Byrd : I wanted to just talk, as you can imagine about California for a minute. If all of the project that essentially withheld cash to the – arguably to the extent that they would be permitted I wanted to make sure I was clear, how much CAFD would be restricted? You mentioned 18% related to several projects. But I wanted to check if every single piece of debt relating to PG&E sort of exercise their cash, cash strap right, what amount of CAFD would be impacted?
John Ketchum: Yes, so, again it would comprise roughly 18% of our runrate CAFD for 2019. We have included a page in our investor material that – Page 41 that details the CAFD from each of these projects totals about $90 million.
Stephen Byrd : Understood.
John Ketchum: So, let’s go back though, to what I just said, which is that, first of all, even if all of that cash is trapped, we expect to be able to meet our financial expectations 12% to 15% growth in distributions per unit through 2023, we expect we will not have a need to issue common equity until 2020 at the earliest. So our financial expectations are not impacted by any means. The second, the impact of PG&E and SCE cash flows is going to diminish over time. So by the time, we get to the end of the period of our financial expectations, the cash flows from these projects is not going to be significant contributor to the overall CAFD.  And then, I think you have to take a look too, Stephen at what is happening in California. I mean, obviously we are not going to sit on our heels. We are going to pursue all avenues with our noteholders to try to free up that cash and we will work vigorously to do that as I said in the prepared remarks. 
Stephen Byrd : That all makes sense. And John, in terms of any exposure to other California utilities, I am thinking of Edison International and Sempra, just wanted to check both at NEP and NextEra would you mind just speaking briefly to your other California exposure?
John Ketchum: Yes. So, on our other California exposure with SE, I mean right now, we don’t have any, because there is, none of those finances are in default other than the SCE contract that I mentioned which is about 250 megawatts on Desert Sunlight because that’s part of a portfolio financing.  But again, the impacts of that are included in the numbers that I gave you earlier. So, the 250 impact is included in the $0.13 to $0.15 at NextEra Energy, it is also included in the roughly 18% of total CAFD for 2019. 
Stephen Byrd : Okay. But do you have any CAFD exposure not in default, but does – where the offtaker is a subsidiary of either Edison International or Sempra?
John Ketchum: No, zero. 
James Robo: At NEP
John Ketchum: At NEP
Stephen Byrd : Okay, great. Just wanted to check. 
John Ketchum: Zero.
Stephen Byrd : At NEP, okay. And at NextEra, is that significant or is it relatively small?
John Ketchum: It’s relatively small. I mean, the contributions that we would have from SCE contracts are roughly $0.08 and that includes the Desert Sunlight 250. So, without it it’s about $0.06. So small.
Stephen Byrd : Understood. Sorry for all the questions on California, maybe just one last one. You filed at FERC to sort of secure your legal rights under the contracts. Would you mind just to kind of briefly talking through your legal arguments around ensuring to protect your rights under your contract?
John Ketchum: Yes, I mean, the bottom-line is, we think the majority of those contracts have Mobile-Sierra provisions and that these contracts are in the public interest and that the federal power act preempts what the bankruptcy court can do and the FERC has the final say assumption or rejection. 
Stephen Byrd : That’s very good. That’s all I have. Thank you very much.
Operator: We will now go to our next question and that will come from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research.
Steve Fleishman : Yes, good morning. So, just first on the NEP plan. I assume your – embedded in there you are assuming that you can continue to get financing other than equity, I assume including some of the – like private financing, converts and such that you gotten in the past. How do you feel about the ability to get those with this California uncertainty? 
John Ketchum: First of all on the financings like the Blackrock financing, still feel good about our ability to be able to execute against those types of financings and again, we also have a lot of debt capacity at NEP that we can always fall back on as well. 
Steve Fleishman : Okay. And then, just separate question off-topic, could you update your interest in – thoughts and interest in Santee Cooper? 
James Robo : Yes, thanks, Steve. This is Jim. We did put a proposal in to acquire Santee Cooper. I think I've been very clear that we have been interested in pursuing Santee Cooper over the last 18 months or so and we did put a proposal in to acquire it and we look forward to the next steps of the process that the committee is going to be going through. 
Steve Fleishman : Do you have any idea when you will get an answer?
James Robo : I think this is a process that ultimately have to – if the legislature decides to sell Santee Cooper, it's going to have to actually pass a law to do so essentially and the legislative session ends at the end of May or June in that time period. So, it’s going to play out over the next several months. That’s the bottom-line, Steve. 
Steve Fleishman : Okay, Armando, best to you. Thank you.
James Robo : Thanks, Steve.
Operator: And now we will go to Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. 
Julien Dumoulin-Smith : Hey good morning. Congrats Armando. Can you hear me?
Armando Pimentel: Yes, thanks, Julien. 
Julien Dumoulin-Smith : Good. Well, just one quick clarification on the FERC strategy on NEP and then move away from it. But, just if there is indeed some kind of stay, how does that impact the [technical faults] [ph] and the possibility of distribution. Just want to clarify that. Or cash from PG&E for that matter.
James Robo : Yes, from a FERC standpoint, if there were a FERC – well, first of all, FERC were to ramp the relief that we are seeking by the end of the week. I mean, I think it just would grant FERC the final say and what happens to the contract. So I don’t think it really has any impact on the status of the existing financings. 
Julien Dumoulin-Smith : Got it. Okay, fair enough. Excellent. And then, just want to turn back to FPL real quickly. Specifically, on the last call, you talked about having – shall we say, adequate reserve amortization. You also talk about usage trends et cetera and the ability to potentially avoid base rate increases in 2021 and 2022.  Where does that stand now? How if at all is that impacted by some of the latest events? Just curious on how you are positioning FPL into the longer term here?
James Robo : Yes, I don’t think it’s impacted by any of the current events. We feel very good about our position in front of the OPC if that was – Julien, is what you are referring to as other events. We’ve ended the year…
Julien Dumoulin-Smith : More specific, quite a bit, what are you expecting to tell something more formal about a further rate stay out?
John Ketchum: Well, here is where we are right now. We have $540 million of surplus ending the year. We have – we believe and expect to have enough surplus to potentially stay out of rate case for 2021 and 2022. We will make those strategic rate case decisions later, but we have a lot of flexibility and that flexibility is very good for Florida customers, because the longer we are able to stay out, the longer period of time that build stay where they are, and then I’ll see a bill impact from another rate case.
James Robo : Julien, this is Jim. I think you can expect us to give you all - some more thoughts on that fronts in the June investor conference. 
Julien Dumoulin-Smith : Excellent. And then, maybe, Jim, this is a quick question, your direction, but as you think kind of conceptually, first you’ve given the commitments from the last Analyst Day around midstream, potentially some of the latest developments you’ve already alluded to around renewable especially some of the RPS expansions that might be coming in the next six months prior to the June Analyst Day. Could you give us a little bit of your latest thought process around your future investment prospects just a little bit more holistically?
James Robo : Yes, sure. I mean, when you look at our capital investment plans, I think they are over $12 billion this year. When you look at what we are doing at FPL Gulf and Energy Resources combines, something in that range, we are as of the year before last. We don’t have the details yet on last year. We were the fourth largest investor of capital in the United States in any industry, only AT&T, Verizon, and Amazon invested more in this country than we did in terms of capital investment.  And we are going to continue to do what we have done for more than a decade which is invest smart capital at FPL to improve the value proposition for customers and we are going to – we are very excited about and we will have more to say about what we are doing at Gulf at our June meeting. But we have hit the ground running.  Very excited about what we are doing in terms of what investment prospects are on the Gulf front and we are moving aggressively forward on that pretty much on day one. And at Energy Resources, it is the best renewable environment that we have ever seen and we are going to continue to invest in renewable going forward and as we see pipeline opportunities - contracted pipeline opportunities we will continue invest in those as well.  So, I don’t think you should expect a big change in our thinking in June. I think you will just see us frankly go forward our vision through the amount of investment and the amount of customer improvement that we are going to bring to our customers as well as the amount of what we are going to do in terms of earnings going forward.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith : I’ll leave it there. Thank you very much. 
John Ketchum: Thanks, Julien. 
Operator: We will now go to Greg Gordon of Evercore ISI. 
Greg Gordon: Yes, congratulations to all three of you, it goes without saying you're all terrific at your jobs. And Armando, someone asked me to ask you, if you could get circle back to people and tell us where you’d like to fish that would be good now that you are going to have lot of time.
Armando Pimentel: That’s common.
Greg Gordon: Couple questions. Can you just go back over what you said about the levelized cost of energy for battery with storage and what I am particularly interested other than just a restatement of that is what delivery year you see that crossover happening on sort of a large enough scale to tip this sort of disruptive transition that you are talking about?
John Ketchum: Yes, so, what we covered in Jim’s remarks, we will start with the wind. So, wind, we are expecting to be right around $20, $25 a megawatt hour. I would kind of put that we have some PTC helping there, this is a no incentive look. So call it, when those incentives expire more towards the middle of the decade that 2024 timeframe.  So, $20, $25 a megawatt for wind and we think batteries are going to be about $0.05 to 7.5 cent adder. And so, that’s how we were able to – I am sorry, per megawatt, that’s how we are able to get to the ranges that Jim provided for wind. So just take the 20, 25 add on 5 to 7 for battery storage. For solar, don’t forget, we have the solar ITCs at 30% through the end of 2023.  And so, when those ITCs go away and they don’t ever go away, right. They go from 30% to 10%, we are expecting that solar given how quickly panel costs are coming down, balance of panel costs are coming down, solar is a product we are going to be selling in the $25 to $30 a megawatt hour range and then the same adders for batteries is how you get to the math that we are in Jim’s remarks and those are the expectations we have.  And the solar pricing isn’t really all that far off from what we are doing in the day. So that’s not much of a leap per se. 
Greg Gordon: Okay. That makes sense. I appreciate it and last question, you didn’t mention it explicitly anywhere in your comments, but the balance sheet capacity of $5 billion to $7 billion, I mean your credit metrics and the position on the balance sheet seems unchanged from last quarter. So I would assume that you still feel like that balance sheet capacity is in place?
John Ketchum: Yes, and Gordon – Greg, one of the things that we said there is that, we had 5 to 7, right. We bought Trans Bay, that was $1 billion. So we took that down, call it 4 to 6 and we are earmarking probably another $2 billion of CapEx opportunities for FPL. We’ll update what – where exactly that will be used at our June conference. But certainly some of that money is going to go the 30-by-30 initiative that we already announced earlier last week. 
Greg Gordon: Got you. Great update. Thank you guys. 
Operator: We now will go to Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs
Michael Lapides: Hey guys. Armando, congrats on your announcement and to the rest of the team to John, Rebecca, as well. Great to see people move around and get new opportunity. One question about Florida ballet initiative that is being pushed right now. Can you just talk about what is actually in that ballet initiative? What it would mean if it would have garnered the votes and what’s the process from here? 
Armando Pimentel : Yes. I am going to turn that question over to Eric.
Eric Silagy: Hey, Michael. How are you doing today?
Michael Lapides: I am great, Eric. Thanks for taken the question.
Eric Silagy: Yes, no problem. The ballet initiative, it’s being primus about helping Florida customers, but it’s not about it all. When you look at it it’s really about furthering the business interest of the few folks including a retail electric provider that’s located and based out of Gainesville, that markets power currently outside of Florida.  This is a group, they have tried unsuccessfully to get this proposal in front of voters through the Constitutional Revision Commission and also through the – unsuccessfully they tried through legislation in Tallahassee. Their efforts have been unsuccessful in the past because, frankly, Florida's regulated electricity market works really well.  When you look at the state, the power prices are among the lowest in the nation with electricity that’s among the cleanest and most reliable in the country. As an example, Florida Power & Light offers our customers bills that are more than 30% lower than the national average. Lower than bills in 45 states.  And, as John said earlier, we are just recognized third time in four years as t he most reliable electric provider in the country which is you could appreciate in a state like this is important when our customers need us most particularly during times of storms and hurricanes.  So playing simply, it’s a proposal that just – it actually will lead to increases in electric rates across a state, reduced reliability, particularly during periods of storms, hurricanes, things of that nature. And I think it’s going to compromise the clean energy goals that have been announced including the one we just did on FPL’s 30-by-30 initiative as the unregulated star producers would, they’d have no restrictions on the type of generation that would build.  Also, I think it’s important to understand on these type of things that consumer protections are removed. You no longer have Florida Public Service Commission role in determining what rates are. They would no longer be viewed as being just and reasonable if that’s the standard would go out the window, and that’s going to impact reliability as well.  The ability of the customers, this language would actually prohibit customers from being able to buy power from the existing utility. So Florida Power & Light customers would not be able to continue to be customers of Florida Power & Light. There is some other areas too that I think just to be a lot of focus on including the fact that franchise fees which we collect and pay to municipalities across the state would be eliminated.  And that is significant amount of revenue that would no longer be available to pay for things like first responders, fire fighters, police, hospital employees, these municipalities that everybody counts on. Even you look at now attorney generals in a number of other states have called for the end of deregulation due to all the consumer complaints and the deceptive trade practices.  So, there is a lot of reasons why these proposals have failed across the country since, frankly early 2000s. You look at including even recently in Nevada work failed. There is – when you look at other states that and look and just say a lot of backed away, particularly after the California crisis and when Enron moved into California to take advantage of their so-called market-based model, which was ultimately the catalyst for that crisis and helped contributed the state having some of the highest power prices in the country.  So, I don’t think it’s by accident that there hasn’t been a state that’s passed deregulation since the California power crisis which occurred now nearly twenty years ago. So, there is a number of hurdles. The answer to your question that have to be cleared for this proposal to go forward to be placed on the ballet.  We are going to be very actively engaged. We're going to be educating Floridians on the true motives of the special interest groups, and we are going to also spend a lot of time educating folks on the significant negative impacts that this failed idea would have on the state and on their pocket books.
Michael Lapides: Got it. Thank you, Eric. I appreciate that. I have one other for either, Jim, John or Armando and this is more longer term. When you are watching what's happening in California with PG&E with that is an international or SoCal Ed and put California in the context of being the nation’s largest renewable market and with the most aggressive renewable target.  How do you think this impacts the broader U.S. development of renewable if one of t he largest markets is going through some turmoil? And how do you think about that kind of longer term? 
James Robo: So, great question, Michael. I think, one of – the first thing I would say is, California has some very aggressive renewable targets and some very aggressive climate change goals. The turmoil around the credit of the most important counterparties in the state is, to say at least does not conducive to continued capital investment to continue to further those goals.  And so, I think it’s a very – from an energy policy standpoint in the State of California, it’s going to be very important for the state to recognize that and to recognize that there has been significant capital investment by companies from around the world to make that happen and to the extent that that investment is somehow diminished by these credit issues.  I think that's going to have a real impact on their market going forward and I think the state understands that and it’s one of the elements of the things that they are grappling with now as they deal with the fallout from the tragic fires as well as some of the other issues that they have been facing.  So, the good news from a market standpoint is, California was obviously the biggest market in the country ten years ago in the renewable business. It isn’t any more. It’s an important market, but it’s no longer the most important market in the country and with the cost declines in renewable, nearly every state in the country is in the – we have an opportunity to do business and I mean, we have – my last count, we have development going on in 48 states right now.  We don’t have operating projects in 48 states, but we have development going on in 48 states. So, while I think it’s very important for the state to address these issues from a climate change standpoint going forward, I think the renewable market is going to be robust going forward because it is just gotten so big and the cost declines have expanded the market to such a dramatic fashion. 
Operator: And with that, we'll go now to Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank.
Jonathan Arnold: Yes, good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. 
James Robo: Hey, good morning, Jonathan. 
Jonathan Arnold: A quick question on – this is how I think about you talked about managing through the situation at NEP in context of the growth rate. So, as we think about things you might do that would fall under that header, you mentioned pushing to have the cash released.  And I guess you could drop down other assets more quickly, you could let the dividend, thrift down in the range and still be within 12 to 15. Is there anything else I am missing? And which of those kind of alternatives would you either be planning to use or not use?
John Ketchum: Yes, I think I’d go first of all back to the prior – one of the prior questions about are there other attractive financing vehicles available? One, yes, we think they are. But, two, even if we had to finance additional drops to meet our financial expectations with existing debt capacity that we have, we can do that.  We're fine. And so, really the way I would answer that question is that, obviously we’ll vigorously try to put it to negotiate something what the holders that would allow us to end the DOE. Don’t forget the DOE is in these projects that will allow us to free up the cash, we can’t do that.  We have debt capacity, plenty of debt capacity at NEP. Energy Resources is coming off with a best development year in its history. We have very clear visibility to growth prospects going forward and there are many levers in the vehicle. So, we are comfortable in our ability to manage through even a worst case scenario, which would be where the cash is trapped until a final call is made on the contracts.
Jonathan Arnold: Okay. So, John, I think, to be clear, you said that in some of them the cash is trapped just by virtue of PG&E saying that it may file. Is t hat correct? And I am curious.
John Ketchum: Yes. But not to get into the technicalities, but the – one of the financings has a provision that basically just says that there is corporate action taken in further and so the bankruptcy which are largely the filing of the 8-K to be that would constitute - potentially constitute an event of default.
Jonathan Arnold: So that was just on one of them?
John Ketchum: That’s on the Genesis financing.
Jonathan Arnold: Okay. And then what would it …
John Ketchum: It’s on some of the other need financing, but the need financings are small. It’s a series of four five projects that don’t have any meaningful contribution earnings.
Jonathan Arnold: So, that would be a sort of a judgment as to what would definitively constitute that not occurring presumably?
John Ketchum: Yes, I mean, it doesn’t happen and I think it’s back to its business as usual. 
Armando Pimentel: Jonathan, let me just add, let me add something. I mean, obviously I think it’s appropriate for the focus on the PG&E assets and the cash flows. But we still have at both at NextEra Energy Resources and at NextEra Energy Partners, we still have a lot of projects that are not PG&E and Southern California Edison projects.  It have significant cash flows and there are still many parties that are interested in attractive financings, attractive for us and presumably for them that we are talking to. And it's not necessarily about what’s the risk of PG&E and Southern California Edison. It’s about, hey, what other assets are available for us to be able enter into those types of financing.  So, I think, while it’s appropriate to have some focus on what’s going on with PG&E, we got to remember that NextEra Energy Resources has had its – we have 6600 megawatts of origination this year which is a record year and that’s twice the amount we had last year which was a record year and I got to tell you, we feel at least internally, very comfortable, as John said, that even if these PG&E cash flows are tied up in these debt financings, that we can meet our current expectations and one of the reasons that we feel that way is because we are talking to the market, and two, origination is going very well in Energy Resources. 
Jonathan Arnold: Great. That’s helpful perspective. Thank you, Armando. And then, could I just one other thing. With the Gulf and Florida acquisitions having closed, sooner, I think than maybe you thought, is there – but you're not talking of any accretion in 2019. It would just sort of help us sort of understand the bump in 2020, what’s driving that and why nothing this year?
Armando Pimentel: So, Jonathan, obviously, we got to done it little earlier than we thought, but we also always assume that we have some cost to achieve t his year to get there. So, we are being conservative as we always are and we feel very good about our plans at Gulf and you can bet I am pushing the team very hard to get things done even faster than we’ve laid out.  And so, I am really optimistic about the future for Gulf in this company and in our ability to bring real value to their customers and real value to shareholders. So, very excited about it. We will have more to talk about it in June. But, remember we don’t have any cost to achieve in any of these numbers in 2019, so. 
Jonathan Arnold: Thank you very much.
Operator: And with that, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today’s conference. We want to thank you again for attending today’s presentation.

John Ketchum: Thank you, Matt. And good morning, everyone. Before I begin my remarks on the third quarter results, I would like to say a few words about Hurricane Florence and Michael. As you know, residents of the Southeastern US were recently impacted by the severe effects of these dangerous and deadly storms. Our deepest sympathies are with those who have been impacted by these storms’ widespread destruction. We are grateful for the support that others have given us over the years and we were fortunate to be in a position to assist other utilities this year.  As part of our assistance efforts, we sent several 1,000 of our employees and contractors to support the restoration efforts of our neighboring utilities. In addition, FPL was able to quickly resource service to the approximately 70,000 customers who were impacted by Hurricane Michael as the hardening and automation investments at FPL was made since 2006 to build a stronger, smarter and more storm-resilient energy grid continue to benefit customers.  Now, turning to our financial performance. NextEra Energy delivered strong third quarter results. And building upon the solid progress made in the first half of the year, remains well positioned to achieve our overall objectives for 2018. NextEra Energy’s third quarter adjusted earnings per share increased by $0.33 or approximately 18% against the prior year quarter, reflecting strong execution of both Florida Power & Light and Energy Resources.  Year-to-date we have grown adjusted earnings per share by approximately 14% compared to the prior year comparable period, as we continue to execute well on our major initiatives. At Florida Power & Light earnings per share increased $0.18 year-over-year. Strong growth was driven by continued investment in the business to maintain our best-in-class customer value preposition of clean energy, low bills, high reliability and outstanding customer service.  Consistent with our expectations, we achieved our target regulatory ROE of 11.6% early in the third quarter. All of our major capital initiatives remain on track including the 1,750 megawatt Okeechobee Clean Energy Center and construction of four 74.5 megawatt solar energy centers that are currently being built under the Solar Base Rate Adjustment or SOBRA mechanism of the rate case settlement agreement.  During the quarter we completed the acquisition of Florida City Gas, and welcomed its employees and customers to the NextEra Energy family. As a reminder, starting this quarter, financial results for FCG are being reported as part of our FPL business segment.  The proposed acquisitions of Gulf Power and ownership stakes in two natural gas power plants continue to progress well. In September, the Federal Trade Commission granted Early Termination of the Waiting Period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust requirements. In addition, the change of control proceedings with FERC are currently uncontested. Subject to obtaining the FERC approval and satisfaction of customary closing conditions, we continue to expect the Gulf Power transaction to close in the first half of 2019. Assuming the transactions close, financial results for the natural gas plants will be reported as part of Energy Resources and Gulf Power will be reported as its own business segment.  At Energy Resources, adjusted EPS increased by roughly 18% year-over-year primarily as a result of the favorable impact of the lower corporate income tax rate. Continuing the success of recent quarters, since the last earnings call we had our most successful quarter of renewable origination in our history adding nearly 2,100 megawatts to our backlog, including approximately 650 megawatts of additional wind repowering opportunities and 120 megawatts of battery storage projects.  We were pleased to sign our first transaction in which a customer is combining wind and solar energy with the battery storage solution to best match its load profile at the lowest cost. This transaction includes the largest combined solar and storage facility in the United States announced to-date. I will provide more details on our continued origination success later in the call.  Overall, with three strong quarters complete in 2018, we are pleased with the progress we are making at NextEra Energy and are well positioned to achieve the full year financial expectations that we have previously discussed subject to our usual caveats.  Now, let’s look at the detailed results beginning with FPL. For the third quarter of 2018, FPL reported net income of $654 million or $1.37 per share, an increase of $88 million and $0.18 per share respectively year-over-year. Regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 13% over the same quarter last year and was a principal driver of FPL’s net income growth of nearly 16%. FPL’s capital expenditures were approximately $1.1 billion in the third quarter and we expect our full year capital investments to total between $4.9 billion and $5.1 billion. As I previously mentioned, our reported ROE for regulatory purposes was 11.6% for the 12 months ended September 30, 2018, which is at the upper end of the allowed band of 9.6% to 11.6% under our current rate agreement.  As a reminder, rather than seek recovery from customers of the approximately $1.3 billion in Hurricane Irma storm restoration cost, FPL utilized its remaining available reserve amortization to offset nearly all of the expense associated with the write-off of the regulatory asset related to Irma cost recovery ending 2017 with a zero dollar reserve amortization balance.  After achieving FPL’s target regulatory ROE of 11.6% early this quarter, we restored $301 million of FPL’s reserve amortization balance. We continue to expect that FPL will end 2020 with a sufficient amount of reserve amortization to operate under the current base rate settlement agreement for up to two additional years for any further customer benefits by potentially avoiding the base rate increase in 2021 and 2022.  All of our major capital projects at FPL are progressing well. Construction on the approximately 1,750 megawatt Okeechobee Clean Energy Center remains on budget and on schedule to enter service in mid-2019.  The four solar sites totaling nearly 300 megawatts of combined capacity that are currently being built across FPL’s service territory are all on track and on budget to begin providing cost effective energy to FPL customers in early 2019. These projects are a continuation of one of the largest solar expansions ever in the US and are part of FPL’s plans for a significant increase in new solar projects across Florida over the coming years.  We have secured sites that could potentially support more than 6 gigawatts of FPL’s continued solar growth. Beyond solar, the roughly 1,200 megawatt Dania Beach Clean Energy Center continues to advance through development and is scheduled for siting board approval later this quarter to support its projected commercial operation date in 2022.  Our continued investments in hardening and automation of our existing transmission and distribution system also continued to progress well. We continue to expect that FPL’s ongoing smart investment opportunities will support a compound annual growth rate and regulatory capital employed net of accumulated deferred income taxes of approximately 9% from the start of the settlement agreement in January 2017 through at least December 2021, while further enhancing our customer value proposition.  The Florida economy continues to remain strong. Florida seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 3.5% in September, down 0.3 percentage points from a year earlier, and that's the lowest level in the last decade. As an indicator of new construction, new building permits remain at healthy levels.  The most recent rating of the Case-Shiller Index for South Florida shows home prices up 5.1% from the prior year. Overall, Florida's economy continues to grow with the latest ratings of Florida's consumer confidence remaining near the highest levels of the past decade.  FPL’s third quarter retail sales increased 2.4% from the prior year comparable period. We estimate that less favorable weather had a negative year-over-year impact on usage per customer of approximately 4.1%, which was partially offset by the absence of the effects of Hurricane Irma. On a weather normalized basis, third quarter sales increased 2.9%, continued customer growth and an estimated 2% increase in weather normalized usage per customer both contributed favorably.  While we’re encouraged by the growth and underlying usage, which is an acceleration of the positive trend from the first two quarters of the year, as we have often discussed, this measure can be volatile and at quarterly basis we are not yet ready to draw any firm conclusions about long-term trends. We will continue to closely monitor and analyze underlying usage and we’ll update you on future calls.  We’re pleased with FPL’s year-to-date execution and will continue to maintain our relentless focus on delivering low bills, high reliability, clean energy, and outstanding service to our customers.  Let me now turn to Energy Resources which reported third quarter of 2018 GAAP earnings of $214 million or $0.44 per share. Adjusted earnings for the third quarter were $348 million or $0.73 per share. Energy Resources’ contribution to third quarter adjusted earnings per share increased by $0.11, roughly 18% from the prior year comparable quarter. Contributions from new investments were flat year-over-year. The contribution from existing generation assets increased $0.01 per share as higher PTC volume from our repowered wind projects and improvement in wind resource was mostly offset by a number of smaller items, none of which is particularly noteworthy.  Wind resource was 94% of long-term average versus 87% in the third quarter of 2017. Contributions from our Gas Infrastructure business, including existing pipelines increased by $0.04 year-over-year. The reduction in the corporate federal income tax rate contributed favorably increasing adjusted EPS by $0.11 compared to 2017. All other impacts reduced results by $0.05 per share primarily as a result of higher interest and corporate expenses including increased development activity to support the favorable renewables development environment. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide.  The Energy Resources’ development team continues to capitalize in what we believe is the best renewables development environment in our history delivering a record quarter of wind and solar origination. Since our last earnings call, we have added 850 megawatts of new wind projects, 447 megawatts of new solar projects and 120 megawatts of new battery storage projects to our renewables backlog. Among these approximately 1,420 megawatts of new build contracts, we were pleased to sign our first combined wind, solar and storage transaction as we continue to advance the next phase of renewables deployment that pairs low cost wind and solar energy with a low cost battery storage solution to provide a product that can be dispatched with enough certainty to meet customer needs for a nearly firm generation resource.  Year-to-date, approximately one-third of our solar projects that have been added to backlog include a battery storage component and we continue to include a storage alternative in all of our RFP responses to help further educate our customers on the disruptive pricing of nearly firm renewables. As I have previously mentioned, since our last earnings call, we added approximately 650 megawatts to our repowering backlog. During the quarter, Energy Resources also successfully commissioned an approximately 200 megawatt repowering project and we continue to make solid progress on the remaining 2018 sites. In addition to the nearly 2,100 megawatts of projects added to backlog this quarter, we also executed a 200 megawatt build-own-transfer agreement.  While customer demand for long-term contracted projects remain stronger than ever, we will continue to selectively pursue similar project sale opportunities that may facilitate additional PPA signings while generating a significant portion of the after-tax NPV that we would realize over the life of a contracted wind project.  Through the first three quarters of 2018, we have added nearly 4,700 megawatts to our renewables backlog which now totals approximately 9,300 megawatts. To put our current backlog in context, it is larger than Energy Resources’ operating portfolio at the end of 2011, which took us more than 10 years to develop. The scale of origination success that we have had this year reflects a rapidly accelerating demand for low cost wind and solar projects and we continue to believe that by leveraging Energy Resources’ competitive advantages we are well positioned to capture a meaningful share in these markets going forward.  The attached chart provides additional details on where our renewables development program now stands. Based on our current backlog and the ongoing strength of renewables demand, we continue to feel good about the total 2017 to 2020 development ranges that we have previously outlined.  With over two years in the development period remaining, we are already within the outlined ranges for solar and wind repowering and are close to achieving the expected range for US wind.  Beyond renewables, we continue to make progress with the construction of the Mountain Valley Pipeline. Despite being unable to work on stream and wetland crossings, MVP continues to advance construction on a significant portion of the overall route as it continues to work towards resolving outstanding legal challenges. Largely due to these challenges, MVP recently announced that it has increased its overall project cost estimate to $4.6 billion and is now targeting a full in-service date for the pipeline during the fourth quarter of 2019.  As a result of the benefits of tax reform, Energy Resources’ returns for MVP remain attractive despite the recent cost increase. Additionally, the MVP expansion opportunities, including the Southgate project that we continue to advance through development, have strong economics and we believe the overall value of the pipeline will increase through time.  Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the third quarter of 2018 GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $1.007 billion or $2.10 per share. NextEra Energy’s 2018 third quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $1.039 billion and $2.18 per share respectively. Adjusted earnings from the corporate and other segment increased $0.04 per share compared to the third quarter of 2017 primarily due to certain tax items.  We continue to advance Project Accelerate, our company-wide productivity initiative, which is expected to yield several $100 million in run rate efficiencies. For the full year, we expect the total transition cost associated with this initiative to be approximately $44 million, of which $27 million will be recorded at FPL and offset with utilization of reserve amortization. The balance will be charged to Energy Resources and is expected to reduce adjusted EPS by $0.02 to $0.03 per share.  Based on our strong year-to-date performance at NextEra Energy, we remain comfortable with the expectations we have previously discussed for the full year and we'll continue to target the $7.70 midpoint for adjusted EPS range which reflects growth of 8% off of our 2017 adjusted EPS of $6.70 plus approximately $0.45 for the benefit of tax reform.  Longer term, we continue to expect NextEra Energy's adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate to be in a range of 6% to 8% through 2021 off of our 2018 midpoint expectation of $7.70 per share and assuming the Gulf Power and natural gas plants transactions close that the Florida acquisitions will be $0.15 and $0.20 accretive to our 2020 and 2021 adjusted EPS expectations respectively.  From 2018 to 2021, we also expect that operating cash flow will be roughly in line with our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. We continue to expect to grow our dividends per share 12% to 14% per year through at least 2020, off of 2017 base of dividends per share of $3.93. As always, our expectations are subject to usual caveats including but not limited to normal weather and operating conditions.  As a reminder, shortly after the announcement of the acquisition of Gulf Power, Florida City Gas and ownership stakes in two natural gas power plants, we had potential interest rate volatility on the $5.1 billion cash purchase price through the execution of interest rate swaps. Earlier this year, we also entered into a $3 billion forward-starting interest rate hedge agreement that allows us to flexibly manage interest rate exposure on NextEra Energy debt issuances over the coming years.  Following the closing of the Gulf Power transaction, we expect to maintain $5 billion to $7 billion of excess balance sheet capacity through 2021 as a result of anticipated adjustments to rating agency credit metric thresholds. We will look to utilize the remaining balance sheet capacity to either buyback shares or opportunistically execute on accretive incremental capital investments or accretive acquisition opportunities if it makes sense to do so.  As a reminder, the remaining excess balance sheet capacity serves as a cushion as its utilization is not currently assumed in our financial expectations.  In summary, NextEra Energy continues to execute on its strong start to 2018 and remains well positioned to meet its 2018 expectations and long-term growth prospects. We continue to believe that NextEra Energy offers the best investor value proposition among the utility sector.  At FPL, we remain focused on operational cost effectiveness, productivity and making smart, long-term investments to further improve the quality, reliability and efficiency of everything we do.  At Energy Resources, we continue to make terrific progress on our development program by leveraging our significant competitive advantages to capture a meaningful share of the best renewables development environment in our history.  During the third quarter, we were honored to be named to the top 25 of the Fortune’s 2018 Change the World list, the only energy company from the Americas and one of only two electric companies in the world to be recognized. This recognition is a testament to NextEra Energy’s best-in-class position in the renewable energy sector and our continued commitment to the customers and communities we serve.  Combining this advantage with the low cost operating platform that is second to none, one of the strongest credit ratings and balance sheets in the sector, and a strategy that is built to capitalize on ongoing disruption within the industry in the best renewables environment in our history, NextEra Energy is well positioned to drive long-term shareholder value over the coming years.  Let me now turn to NEP. NextEra Energy Partners also continued its strong start to 2018 with year-over-year growth in adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution of approximately 14% and 72%, respectively. CAFD benefited from new project additions and favorable debt service. Yesterday, the NEP Board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.45 per common unit, or $1.80 per common unit on an annualized basis continuing our track record of growing distributions at the top end of our 12% to 15% per year growth range.  During the quarter, NextEra Energy Partners announced an agreement to acquire a geographically diverse portfolio of 11 wind and solar projects from Energy Resources as it continues to execute on its long-term growth strategy. The approximately 1.4 gigawatt portfolio should further enhance the already best-in-class quality and diversity of NEP’s existing portfolio with an average 17 year contract life and counterparty credit rating of Baa1 following the acquisition. The acquired asset should also enable NEP to complete the growth necessary to achieve our previously outlined year end 2018 expectations, while also replacing the Canadian portfolio that we divested earlier this year. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter subject to customary closing conditions and the receipt of certain regulatory approvals. The $1.275 billion cash purchase price is expected to be financed with the Canadian asset sale proceeds and the $750 million convertible equity portfolio financing that I will discuss in more detail in a moment.  By redeploying the proceeds from the Canadian portfolio sale, which was executed at an attractive 10 year average CAFD yield of 6.6% inclusive of the present value of the O&M origination fee into a portfolio yielding an approximately 10% CAFD yield that also benefits from a lower effective corporate tax rate and a longer tax shield in the US versus Canada, these transactions are expected to support a longer runway for LP distribution growth.  Since the last call, we are also pleased to announce the execution of a long-term contract that enables an approximately $115 million investment and additional pipeline compression capacity on the Texas pipelines, which is expected to be initially financed with NEP’s existing debt capacity. The expansion opportunity is expected to deliver attractive returns to LP unitholders and demonstrates the organic growth potential of NEP’s underlying portfolio.  Subject to regulatory approvals, we expect the project to be in service during the fourth quarter of 2020 and continue to pursue additional expansion opportunities for the pipeline system.  Consistent with our long-term growth prospects, today, we are introducing December 31, 2019 run rate expectations reflecting roughly 20% and 17% growth from the comparable year end 2018 run rate adjusted EBITDA and CAFD midpoints respectively.  Overall, we are pleased with the year-to-date execution at NEP and are well positioned to meet our 2018 and longer term expectations.  Now, let's look at the detailed results. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $203 million and cash available for distribution was $81 million, up approximately 14% and 72% from the prior year comparable quarter respectively, primarily due to portfolio growth. New projects added $45 million of adjusted EBITDA and $28 million of cash available for distribution.  The CAFD contribution from new projects benefited from favorable timing of debt service and tax equity PAYGO payments.  Offsetting the growth of new projects was the sale of the Canadian portfolio which drove an $18 million decline in adjusted EBITDA. The divestiture had a favorable impact on cash available for distribution this quarter due to the elimination of debt service payments on the Canadian portfolio.  For the NEP portfolio, wind resource was favorable at 94% of long-term average versus 82% in the third quarter of 2017, which provided a benefit to adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution year-over-year.  For adjusted EBITDA, this benefit was offset by the year-over-year reduction in the pretax value of NEP’s tax credits as a result of decline in the federal income tax rate. This change has no impact on CAFD.  As a reminder, these results include the impact of IDR fees which we treat as an operating expense. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide.  As I previously mentioned to finance the acquisition that we announced during the quarter, NEP will use a combination of the Canadian asset sale proceeds as well as a $750 million convertible equity portfolio financing with BlackRock. And exchange for BlackRock’s contribution, it will receive an equity interest in the portfolio that NEP is acquiring. NEP will receive an initial 85% share of the cash distributions from the portfolio during the first three years and BlackRock will receive the remaining 15%, which represents an effective annual coupon during that three year period of approximately 2.5%.  During the fourth year of the agreement, NEP expects to exercise its right to buy out BlackRock’s equity interest for a fix payment equal to $750 million plus a fixed pre-tax return of 7.75% inclusive of all prior distributions with a minimum of 70% of the buyout price paid in NEP common units issued at no discount to the then current market price and the balance paid in cash.  Following the initial three year period, if NEP has not exercised its buyout right, BlackRock’s allocation of distributable cash flow from the portfolio would increase to 80%.  The financing is expected to be an additional low cost equity-like product for NextEra Energy Partners and further demonstrates NEP’s ability to access additional attractive source of capital to finance its growth.  In addition to providing further third-party confirmation of NEP’s growth outlook and high quality portfolio, with the right to convert a minimum of 70% of the portfolio financing into NEP units issued at no discount, the transaction further reduces NEP’s equity needs going forward. NEP also recently reinitiated use of its aftermarket equity issuance program. During the quarter, we successfully completed the sale of approximately 1.7 million in NEP common units raising roughly $81 million under the ATM program. Going forward, we will continue to flexibly seek opportunities to use the aftermarket program depending on market conditions and other considerations.  For the full year 2018, we expect to achieve growth of roughly 20% for adjusted EBITDA and CAFD even after excluding the benefit from the acceleration of the note receivable related to the Canadian asset sale which was consistent with our expectations at the start of the year.  Following the acquisition of the announced portfolio from Energy Resources, we expect the NEP assets to support the previously announced December 31, 2018 run rate expectations, reflecting calendar year 2019 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at year end 2018 for adjusted EBITDA of $1 billion to $1.15 billion and cash available for distribution of $360 million to $400 million.  As I mentioned earlier, consistent with our previously announced long-term growth prospects, today, we are introducing December 31, 2019 run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA of $1.2 billion to $1.375 billion and CAFD of $410 million to $480 million reflecting calendar year 2020 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at year end 2019. Our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and include the impact of anticipated IDR fees as we treat these as an operating expense.  From a base of our fourth quarter 2017 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $1.62, we continue to see 12% to 15% per year growth in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2023.  We are pleased with the progress NextEra Energy Partners has made over 2018 against its strategic and growth initiatives. The high quality underlying NEP portfolio is supported by the long-term contracted cash flows, backed by strong counterparty credits.  As we have previously highlighted NEP has the flexibility to grow in three ways: Organically; acquiring assets from third parties; or acquiring assets from Energy Resources portfolio, which continues to rapidly expand given Energy Resources’ competitive advantages and corresponding success in renewables origination. In addition to clear visibility into how it will grow going forward, NEP maintains a cost of capital and access to capital advantage.  Without a need to sell common equity until 2020 at the earliest, other than modest aftermarket issuances, NEP has substantial flexibility to finance its long-term growth as was further demonstrated by the financing transaction executed this quarter and the $5 billion forward-starting interest rate hedge that remains in place.  These strengths together with NEP’s favorable tax position and enhanced governance rights leave NEP well positioned to meet its financial expectations and we remain as enthusiastic as ever about its long-term prospects.  That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we will open the line for questions. 
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Stephen Byrd : I wanted to talk about, at NEP, the BlackRock financing that you described John. Is this something that you view as a potential ongoing tool, meaning is it replicable? Does it have the sort of features that you're looking for? Is this more do you think sort of a one-off transaction?
John Ketchum : Yes, it's absolutely replicable. To be able to find money at a 2.5% yield for the first three years, to be able to convert 70% of the position into NEP stock, really provides an attractive source of capital for us going forward and it's certainly something that we can replicate on future transactions.
Stephen Byrd : Great. And just on the conversion element, you walked through it quite well. I just want to make sure I understood. If you did not convert the security into NEP common, what would the cash coupon yield sort of move up to in that event?
John Ketchum : It moves up to roughly 8%.
Stephen Byrd : Got you. Understood. Okay. And then I wanted to step away back on the wind side and just talk longer term about the growth potential for wind. We do hear a lot of debate about the size of the US wind market when the federal subsidy eventually does sunset. And I know that's down the road, but you all obviously see a lot of technology changes on the wind side. So I was just curious, in the long run, how do you see that playing out in terms of the size of the wind market? Do you see a contraction because of loss of subsidy or technology change is sufficiently beneficial that you see growth continuing? How do you see that changing over time?
Armando Pimentel : Steve, it's Armando. I think longer term, as we've previously pointed out, we think by the mid part of the next decade that the pricing of wind is going to be pretty much on par to where we see it today with a 100% PTC. Now, obviously, we've got to get from a 100% PTC, and 80% and 60% and 40%, down to zero, but we think that the improvements that we are seeing with technology which are essentially taller towers, longer blades, better electronics beyond kind of machine which captures the wind better. We absolutely believe that by mid part of the next decade you're going to have the costs around the same place that you have it today.  In the meantime, for ‘19, ‘20 and what we are seeing now in 2021, wind is going to remain very, very competitive, pretty much where we see it today or maybe even a little bit lower. So we think it's -- we think there's going to be a lot of wind that gets built over the next three to four years on top of the solar and storage that we are clearly seeing is coming to market.
Stephen Byrd : Great. Thanks. And if I could, just one last one on the utility side. You’ve spent some time talking about preparing for dealing with storm damage et cetera. Is there more broadly additional work that might be done just to further harden the system beyond? I know you have extensive efforts underway and have had a good track record of storm recovery, but should we be thinking about potential incremental opportunities for preparing for hurricanes or other sort of physical changes to your system?
John Ketchum : Yes, absolutely, Steve. I'm going to let Eric comment on the details, but we've spoken a little bit about the undergrounding opportunity that we have going forward, the continued automation, the continued hardening that we have in the existing system. I think that certainly applies to Gulf as well, but I'll let Eric expand upon that.
Eric Silagy : Yes, Stephen, so this is Eric Silagy. We have a number of different opportunities and programs that are underway currently. So about 88% of our transmission is currently steel or concrete and we are on a program to take all wood out of our transmission system across our service territory. We'll be done with that after beginning of the decade. I would say there's a lot of opportunities also with additional technology that we continue to deploy on the smart grid side that also helps during storm response. And then, John touched on it, the undergrounding initiatives that we have piloted right now on ways to get additional costs out to make it more affordable will be something that we are focused on for years to come. We have about 6,700 miles of distribution in our system in Florida. 40% of that roughly is underground now. So there's a lot of work to do on the remaining piece and doing it cost effectively is what we are focused on now.
Stephen Byrd : Very good. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Steve Fleishman : Yes, good morning. Could you maybe just talk to how we should think about where you stand on your renewables kind of backlog targets now that you’re already in the lower end of the range? Is it likely you might kind of hit the high end of that or how should we just think about the pacing of additional projects within your kind of backlog goals?
John Ketchum : Well, Steve, we certainly feel very good about where we are. I mean already have 9,300 megawatts added to backlog, adding almost 5,000 already for the year. We are certainly in terrific position given that we still have a couple of more years before the PTC even runs down on us. And so, terrific wind development opportunities, terrific solar opportunities with the four year start of construction, with all of the success that we are having in pairing batteries with solar is enabling a lot more development. So strong progress and potential opportunities across the board. And even when you look at wind, as the PTC expires or starts to phase down from 100% at the end of 2020 to 80% in 2021 and 60% and 40%, with the technology improvements that we are seeing, we think ‘21 is going to look a lot like ‘19. And so you're going to continue to see a lot of progress as you get into the next decade based on the discussions that we've been having with the OEMs and the technology improvements that we know are coming.
Steve Fleishman : Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith : Hey. So maybe just to pick up where Steve left off. Can you comment a little bit about the cadence of that contracting, given again the range that you have for the 2017 through 2020 period for NEER? I mean obviously tremendous success first half of this year. But when do you have to kind of stitch things up just with respect to the development activities for ‘20, I mean do you expect to have continued success at this current pace through ‘18? I mean, I'm just thinking about kind of hitting the midpoint of that range that you talk about, right, at a minimum, if you will, and what that means for contracting activities kind of in the remaining period of that ‘17 through ‘20?
Armando Pimentel : Julien, it's Armando. I think my comments will probably reflect closely on what we said last time which is when Jim and John say that it's probably the best renewables environment in history, we are absolutely seeing that on the origination side. We do not believe that this third quarter origination total is a peak. Obviously, we have a view as to what's going to be happening in the next three to four months and the contracting remains very strong. We have signed some 2020 wind deals. But my expectation is that we are going to see a lot more 2020 wind deals that get priced over the next six months or so. We have priced actually a lot more 2021 and 2022 solar deals than I would have expected at this point. But I also believe that you're going to see some significant 2020 solar origination over the next six months or so. So our origination folks are very busy. There's a lot of RFPs and there's also individual conversations being had with customers. I think customers understand that the PTC is slated to ramp down. So they're anxious on the wind side to get in the queue. They're also anxious on the wind repowering side to get into the queue before the end of 2020 which was one of the reasons why we had strong origination this quarter. So, in my view, we are far from a peak and I think it's going to continue to remain strong for a while.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith : Got it. Excellent. And then just digging a little bit into the numbers here. Can you reconcile a little bit the difference here in the debt service between -- on the ‘18 projected NEER portfolio? And I suppose what comes out of that just given what seems like a higher number is potentially some interest rate exposure. And how do you think about using the flexibility afforded, right? You've got this option before you’ve given the interest rate hedge product that you entered into. When do you choose to enter into that? How do you think about that option?
John Ketchum : Yes, Julien. So I think you're referring on the first part of your question to our EBITDA, CAFD walk. You see some debt service coming out that impacts CAFD in 2018. The answer is simple. It was NPV positive as part of our liability management program to pay some of those debt obligations off early on some of our older projects. And then second, for our repowering activity, we always go ahead and just pay the debt off. We know we are going to put new tax equity on them. That's just a matter of course. That's all that's happening in that line. And then on your second point on when do we look to use the $3 billion interest rate hedge that we have? Remember that product is designed a lot like the NEP $5 billion hedge. We have a tremendous amount of flexibility under both the $3 billion at NextEra Energy and the $5 billion at NEP. Those don't have mandatory forward starts until 2028. So we can essentially decide to bring those in, in whole or in part, at any time we want to over the next 10 years. So if we see interest rates tick up and we want to use debt financing to finance additional capital expenditures, we can always utilize that. But what we like the best about those products is they provide tremendous amount of flexibility as to when we decide to use them.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith : And to clarify the earlier point on the walk, you're saying it was NPV positive but the higher debt service is because you're basically layering a new debt preemptively for repowering? I just want to make sure I heard that right.
John Ketchum : No. Yes, so two things. One is, we have just debt on all projects that it's just NPV positive to go ahead and pay it off. It gives us a refinancing option going forward. And then second, when we repower a project, we want to pay the debt off because we are planning to put tax equity financing in place on those projects going forward and have to be unencumbered in order to put that tax equity financing on those assets.
James Robo : So, Julien, this is Jim. Said another way, we had not planned at the beginning of the year to pay that $150 million of debt off, but we -- through the liability management program, we made a decision to pay it off as NPV positive, so it's good for shareholders and we did it. We did it. We are going to do it this year and so that's why you're seeing that. It's actually a good guy, not a bad guy.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith : Got it. Thank you.
John Ketchum : Yes. You’ve to remember, last year -- and remember, last year, Julien, we did the same thing in the fourth quarter of 2017, $150 million of NPV positive moves on debt repayments around our liability management program. So we are constantly looking for opportunities to save shareholders' money.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith : Much appreciated.
Operator: Our next question comes from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Greg Gordon : Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for clearing that up. That was one of my questions. So there's no material or meaningful floating rate debt exposure at NEER, just to be clear?
John Ketchum : No. No, not at all. Quite the contrary. I think we are very well positioned to manage interest rate risk going forward, much better than our peers. And I think that we not only do we have an access to capital advantage, but a cost of capital advantage in that $3 billion hedge that we have in place, I think will be instrumental going forward.
Greg Gordon : Yes. At first it was little bit confusing, but I see that the debt balance at NEER from Q1 to Q3 is actually on an absolute basis down and that syncs with the footnote there that shows that you include debt retirements in that number. So thank you.  The second question I have is -- was on, there were also some moving parts in the -- on overall EBITDA. So if I look at the story arc from Q1 to Q3, it looks like your assumed EBITDA from renewables is lower. I think is it fair to attribute that to just wind resource over the course of the year? And then, nuclear pipeline is significantly higher. Can you just take us through, generally speaking, how the EBITDA contributions have evolved over the year?
John Ketchum : Yes. I think when we look at it and you'll get an update on this next quarter on how we did going into the year versus how we finished the year, we expect to be within the range on all the items that we provided to you. So while there’s ups and downs in any one quarter and we always try to give investors a good feel, on the nuclear side, we've had better execution on outages, better execution on E4. And on the wind, it's really just been bad resource. So we've made some adjustments there. But again, for the full year, and you'll see this next quarter, our current expectation is that we should be within the range of what we showed you last year on our EBITDA-to-CAFD walk.
Greg Gordon : Yes. And do you have any insight as to why the pipeline numbers improved? Is that just better throughput or you've made more conservative assumptions? What changed there? 
Armando Pimentel : Hey, Greg, it's Armando. I'm not sure. It could be a little better throughput, but it's nothing that's really sticking out at me as to why there's been an improvement.
Greg Gordon : Okay, great. Final question. Nobody has asked, Jim, but you usually do make a comment around where you -- given the robust outlook you have, where you would expect to be inside the 6% to 8% guidance range and you haven't volunteered that yet. So is there a reason why you haven't volunteered? That is something changed with regard to your earnings aspiration inside the range?
James Robo : No, not at all, Greg. I think we continue to target the midpoint for this year of 7.70% and -- but in 2021, I'll be very disappointed if we don't hit the high end of the range.
Greg Gordon : Thank you very much, guys. Take care.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Michael Lapides : Hey, guys. Just an easy one on Project Accelerate. I think this was probably version three of that. When you talk about several hundred million of run rate efficiencies, are these O&M savings that will drop to the bottom-line, so we'll actually see this in some future EPS or is this just O&M savings that will offset other cost increases that will help, but won't necessarily see them on the bottom-line numbers?
James Robo : Hey, Michael, this is Jim. So, first of all, FPL, what it does is create surplus, right? And so it gives us headroom to continue to find good projects for customers to invest, to improve our value proposition without having any impact on rates, okay? So that's how you see it on the FPL side. And at the NEER side, it absolutely falls to the bottom-line.
Michael Lapides : Got it. So safe to assume -- if I were to put a tax rate on the couple of hundred million, let's say, it's $200 million to $250 million to $300 million, some portion of that gets allocated to NEER, I don't know if that's a 50-50 or if this is FP&L weighted and that would almost be something that's already embedded in your EPS guidance for 2020, 2021?
James Robo : Yes, that's right. That's all right and it would -- the split is roughly equal to the EBITDA split of 65-35.
Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you, Jim. Much appreciated.
Operator: Our next question comes from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.
Shahriar Pourreza : So just a real quick follow-up on the BlackRock deal. Are you actually seeing players step up for a similar structure even though you can replicate it? And then, as you sort of think about the NEP standalone just from a self-sustaining standpoint, your equity needs, have they sort of evolved post the deal? I know you kind of still guide around 2020 at the earliest, but that was obviously provided even before this BlackRock deal. So just curious on that and I've got a follow-up.
John Ketchum : Yes, we have received an inordinate amount of inbound interest on structure that looks similar to BlackRock. As a matter of fact, the NEP and the treasury team have been busy fielding those calls. So a lot of inbound interest there. And on -- from an equity standpoint, I think what we said is, look, I mean this is a very low cost of capital, very attractive financing which certainly puts us in good position going forward.
Shahriar Pourreza : Got it. That's helpful. And then just real quick on Gulf Power. You guys have obviously have moved past data rooms and have had more time to sort of digest really what you're buying. So as you sort of think about the accretion guide, you've got an O&M that's almost double the size of yours at FP&L. You have materially higher purchase power cost, no standstill agreements. Like I get the playbook but the math seems to point to somewhat of a conservative guide especially with the inefficiencies you're taking on. One, am I thinking about this correctly? And then just from the timing perspective, the process seems to be moving along relatively quickly. Is there any opportunity to close some time in Q1 versus first half?
James Robo : So I'll take the second part of that first, Shahriar, this is Jim. Listen, we have -- the team has worked very hard to work through all of the potential issues at FERC. We feel very good that in the change of control part of that docket that there are no outstanding protests right now. And so we feel we still have some work to do where we continue to target the first half. But as I tell the team, there's 182 days in the first half and we could close on any one of those days. On the first part, I think when we laid out our guidance for the accretion of the transaction, we were pretty much -- I don't think we were conservative and we weren't aggressive. We were what I'd call [P50], pretty down in the middle of the road on what we think we can achieve. The Gulf Power team is in the midst of a very tough hurricane restoration now. They've done just an outstanding job in a very tough situation and we are doing what we can to help everyone in that part of Florida to restore. And so, we are honestly right now focused on that and feel very good about the transaction. Looking forward to welcoming the Gulf team to the NEE family, and we are looking forward to getting the deal done and moving forward with our plan.
Shahriar Pourreza : Got it. And then, Jim, since no one's asked, any comments you can provide around South Carolina or Santee and then especially with the RFPs expected sometime in the fourth quarter or early Q1?
James Robo : So I don't -- it's been no secret that if there is an RFP on Santee that we would have an interest. And so I think I'll stop it at that. And we've been watching it closely for 18 months and we'll see how that process plays out.
Shahriar Pourreza : Terrific. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Arnold : Good morning, guys. Just on the NEP expansion project, can you just clarify, is that included in the 2019 run rate guidance or would that be incremental?
John Ketchum : Yes. No, it's included in the 2019 run rate guidance. It doesn't come online until 2020, Jonathan.
Jonathan Arnold : Okay. So it's in the 2019 run rate, but it comes in early 2020. Is there incremental -- is there something potentially beyond that, because from memory, there were some bigger opportunities there at one point?
Armando Pimentel : Hey, Jonathan, it's Armando. Just to clear it up. I mean it's -- the expansion project is both in ‘19 and ‘20, right. You've got to start spending CapEx in ‘19 in order to get it done in ‘20. It's COD I think the third quarter of 2020. So it's in the numbers. There's nothing incremental to add.  In terms of additional projects, the team continues to work on several projects associated with the pipelines that it has. It's done a decent job so far since we bought those pipelines in 2015 and we continue -- I continue to have expectations that they will be able to find onsies or twosies to add as projects at NEP. I don't foresee anything that significant at this point, but we would all be very disappointed if we don't continue to see small opportunities that they bring to the table.
Jonathan Arnold : Great. Thank you. And if I may, just to revisit the debt service question just very quickly. Jim mentioned the $150 million increase. I think that's how much it went up between Q2 and Q3, but it was -- there was also a 90 odd million increase in Q2. Is that the same issue as the buyouts of some of the debt associated with repowerings, et cetera?
John Ketchum : Exact same issue. As we repower our assets, you can always expect the debt to be retired and you'll see an impact in the EBITDA, CAFD walk from that.
Jonathan Arnold : So, is it safe to assume that ‘19, given the amount of repowering you have in the plan that this will -- we will have a similar dynamic there and at some point that will roll down to that sort of high 800s number it used to be?
John Ketchum : Yes, that's correct.
Jonathan Arnold : Okay, great. Thank you.
John Ketchum : Yes. Hey, Jonathan, real quick, though, understand that's already in our plan.
Jonathan Arnold : Oh! Yes.
John Ketchum : In our financial expectations, so.
Jonathan Arnold : Okay.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session as well as today's conference. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy delivered strong financial results in the second quarter and remains on track to meet its objectives for the year. Adjusted earnings per share grew by approximately 13% against the prior-year comparable quarter, reflecting successful performance of both Florida Power & Light and Energy Resources. FPL increased earnings per share by $0.20 year over year. Average regulatory capital employed increased by nearly 13% versus the same quarter last year, and all of our major capital initiatives, including the continuation of one of the largest solar expansions ever in the U.S., remain on track. With residential bills nearly 30% below the national average and the lowest among all of the Florida utilities, FPL's focus continues to be on finding smart investments to lower costs, improve reliability and provide clean energy solutions for the benefit of our customers. At Energy Resources, increased contributions from new investments in our repowered wind projects, together with the lower federal income tax rate, helped drive growth of $0.12 per share for the quarter. Building upon the outstanding origination success with which we started the year, since our first quarter call, we added approximately 1,620 megawatts of renewables projects to our backlog, including 535 megawatts of additional wind repowering opportunities and 90 megawatts of battery storage projects. We were pleased to sign two additional solar-plus-storage projects, including the largest solar-plus-storage project announced in the U.S. to date, further signaling the success we're having in the next phase of renewables deployment that pairs low-cost wind and solar energy with a low-cost battery storage solution to provide a nearly firm generation resource. This quarter's origination success in both new and repowered projects is reflective of Energy Resources' ability to leverage its competitive advantages to capitalize on what we have previously characterized as the best renewables development period in our history. During the quarter, we announced proposed transactions that would expand NextEra Energy's regulated business operations through the acquisition of Gulf Power, Florida City Gas, and ownership stakes in two natural gas power plants from Southern Company. The assets are an excellent complement to our existing operations within the state of Florida and will allow NextEra to extend its best-in-class customer value proposition to additional customers over time. Earlier this month, we filed for Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approval to acquire Gulf Power and the two natural gas plants. Subject to obtaining FERC approval and satisfaction of other closing conditions, we expect these transactions to close in the first half of 2019. Meanwhile, we are pleased to announce that the Florida City Gas acquisition is expected to close early next week. Starting in the third quarter, financial results for FCG will be reported as part of our FPL business segment. We expect the approximately $5.1 billion cash purchase price for the transactions to be financed through the issuance of new debt, which we hedged through the execution of interest rate swaps shortly after the acquisition announcement. At the closing of the Gulf Power acquisition, we anticipate that S&P and Moody's will make further favorable adjustments to our credit metric thresholds as a result of the expansion of the company's regulated operations, allowing NextEra Energy to continue to preserve our $5 billion to $7 billion of excess balance sheet capacity while maintaining our strong balance sheet and current credit ratings. With another strong quarter behind us, we are well-positioned to meet our full-year financial expectations, while FPL continues to execute against its capital initiatives, and Energy Resources continues to make very strong progress against its long-term development expectations. Now let's look at the detailed results, beginning with FPL. For the second quarter of 2018, FPL reported net income of $626 million or $1.32 per share, an increase of $100 million and $0.20 per share respectively year over year. Regulatory capital employed growth of 12.9% was a primary driver of FPL's EPS growth of approximately 18% versus the prior-year comparable quarter. As a result of higher-than-expected base revenues and reduced O&M expenses driven by our continued focus on cost management, our reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.5% for the 12 months ending June 2018. We expect FPL to achieve its trailing-12-month target regulatory ROE of 11.6% early in the third quarter, subject to the usual caveats, after which time we will begin partially restoring the reserve amortization balance. We continue to expect that FPL will end 2020 with a sufficient amount of surplus to operate under the current base rate settlement agreement for up to two additional years, creating further customer benefits by potentially avoiding a base rate increase in 2021 and 2022. Turning to our development efforts, all of our major capital projects at FPL are progressing well. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $1.3 billion in the quarter, and we expect our full-year capital investments to be between $4.9 billion and $5.3 billion. Construction on the approximately 1,750-megawatt Okeechobee Clean Energy Center remains on budget and on schedule to enter service in mid-2019. Additionally, the approximately 300 megawatts of solar projects being built across FPL's service territory under the Solar Base Rate Adjustment, or SOBRA, mechanism of the settlement agreement remain on track to begin providing cost-effective energy to FPL customers in early 2019. These projects, which are expect to generate more than $40 million in total savings for FPL customers during their operating lifetime, are part of FPL's plans for more than 3,200 megawatts of new solar projects across Florida over the coming years. Beyond solar, the roughly 1,200-megawatt Dania Beach Clean Energy Center continues to advance through the development process to support its projected commercial operation date in 2022. We continue to expect that FPL's ongoing smart investment opportunities will support a compound annual growth rate and regulatory capital employed, net of accumulated deferred income taxes of approximately 9% from the start of the settlement agreement in January 2017 through at least December 2021, while further enhancing our customer value proposition. The Florida economy remains strong. Florida's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in June was 3.8%, down 0.3 percentage points from a year earlier and near the lowest levels in a decade. Within the housing sector, the Case-Shiller Index for South Florida shows home prices up 5% from the prior year, and new building permits remain strong, increasing nearly 17% year over year. At the same time, the June rating of Florida's consumer sentiment is near the highest levels in a decade. After multiple years of strong economic growth, the GDP of Florida recently passed $1 trillion, which would make it the 17th-largest economy in the world. FPL's second quarter retail sales decreased 3.3%, and we estimate that approximately that 5.2% of this decline can be attributed to weather-related usage per customer. On a weather-normalized basis, second quarter sales increased 1.9%. Customer growth and an estimated 1% increase in weather-normalized usage per customer, which is a continuation of the positive trend from the first quarter, both contributed favorably. While we are encouraged by the continued growth in underlying usage, we are not yet ready to draw any firm conclusions about long-term trends. We will continue to closely monitor and analyze underlying usage and will update you on future calls. Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported second quarter 2018 GAAP earnings of $274 million or $0.55 per share. Adjusted earnings for the second quarter were $408 million or $0.86 per share. Energy Resources' contribution to adjusted EPS increased by $0.12 or approximately 16% year over year. New investments added $0.07 per share. Contributions from existing generation assets also increased by $0.07 per share, primarily due to the absence of outages at our Seabrook and Point Beach nuclear facilities and increased PTC volume from our repowered wind projects. Contributions from our gas infrastructure business, including existing pipelines, increased by $0.04 year over year. The reduction in the corporate federal income tax rate also contributed favorably, increasing adjusted EPS by $0.13 compared to 2017. Offsetting these gains were lower contributions from our customer supply and trading businesses, which declined $0.05 versus a particularly strong second quarter last year. All other impacts reduced results by $0.14 per share, primarily as a result of higher interest and corporate expenses, including increased development activity to support the favorable renewables development environment. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide. As I mentioned earlier, this quarter the Energy Resources development team continued the strong origination success with which we started the year. Since our last earnings call, we have added 300 megawatts of new wind projects, 692 megawatts of new solar projects, and 90 megawatts of new battery storage projects to our renewables backlog. Of these 1,082 megawatts added to backlog, 99 megawatts of the wind projects, 21 megawatts of the solar projects, and a 15-megawatt storage-only project are for delivery this year. The accompanying chart updates information we provided on last quarter's call, but our overall expectations have not changed. We continue to track against our total development forecast for 2017 through 2020. With a backlog of over 7,400 megawatts, our future wind, solar, and storage development program has never been stronger. To put that into perspective, the current backlog is nearly two times larger than at any time prior to the end of 2016. Included in this quarter's backlog additions are 300 megawatts of solar projects for delivery beyond 2020, which brings Energy Resources' total post-2020 solar backlog to nearly 600 megawatts. These projects are supported by the solar ITC start of construction guidance that the IRS provided last month. Similar to the guidance that was released for wind in 2016, the new IRS guidance extends the ITC for an additional four-year period, subject to beginning significant physical work or meeting certain safe harbor conditions. Therefore, we now expect that a solar facility that commences construction in 2019 by complying with the safe harbor to procure 5% of the total capital to be invested and achieves commercial operation by the end of 2023 will qualify for the full 30% investment tax credit. In addition to driving increased solar development into the next decade, the guidance further supports the next phase of renewables deployment that includes a low-cost battery storage component. Battery storage projects that are paired with and charged a minimum of 75% by a solar facility qualify for the ITC during this period. As battery cost declines and efficiency gains are realized during the four-year start of construction period, we continue to expect that in the next decade, new nearly firm wind and solar without incentives will be cheaper than the operating cost of traditional inefficient generation resources, creating significant opportunities for renewables growth going forward. Indicative of customer demand for a nearly firm renewable product specifically designed to meet the customers' needs, the 300 megawatts of solar projects added to backlog for post-2020 delivery will be paired with 75 megawatts of battery storage projects. During the quarter, we were also pleased to have project-financed our first solar-plus-storage system, providing capital that can be recycled into additional growth opportunities at Energy Resources. As I previously mentioned, since our last earnings call, we added 535 megawatts to our repowering backlog. These five repowering opportunities, which are being pursued under new and existing power purchase agreements, bring our total announced repowerings to roughly 2,850 megawatts. Our development team is in active negotiations with customers under other existing PPAs to facilitate additional repowering opportunities and based on the progress of these discussions, we now expect to be in the upper half of the $2.5 billion to $3 billion in total capital deployment for repowerings that we have previously outlined for 2017 through 2020. During the quarter, Energy Resources successfully commissioned an approximately 100-megawatt repowering project, and we continue to make solid progress on the remaining 2018 sites. Beyond renewables, the construction of the Mountain Valley Pipeline has faced some recent challenges. The 4th Circuit Court issued a stay on the stream and wetland crossing permit issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for approximately 160 miles of the MVP route in West Virginia. MVP was able to work with the Corps to have a modified 404 nationwide permit issued that we believe addresses the court's concerns. We are hopeful that the 4th Circuit will respond favorably to the modified permit and the Army Corps' request for the stay to be lifted. If construction is able to resume in the affected area shortly, we believe that there will only be a slight delay to the in-service date for the pipeline to the first quarter of 2019. At this time, we do not expect any material financial impacts to Energy Resources as a result of the stay. Despite these issues, development on the MVP Southgate project, which is the proposed expansion pipeline that will deliver gas from the MVP mainline in Virginia to customers in central North Carolina, continues to progress well. We continue to evaluate the open season interest from additional market participants and expect to file the FERC application later this year to support the targeted in-service date of the fourth quarter 2020. Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy, for the second quarter of 2018, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $795 million or $1.64 per share. NextEra Energy's 2018 second quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $1 billion and $2.11 per share, respectively. Adjusted earnings from the Corporate & Other segment decreased $0.07 per share, compared to the second quarter of 2017, primarily as a result of an unfavorable tax ruling related to the disposal of spent nuclear fuel. In total, NextEra Energy's second quarter results reflect a one-time charge of $0.06 as a result of this unfavorable tax ruling. Based on our strong first half performance at NextEra Energy and our continued expectations for an even stronger second half, with more of our growth expected to occur in the fourth quarter, we remain comfortable with the expectations we have previously discussed for the full year, and we'll continue to target the $7.70 midpoint of our adjusted EPS range. Longer term, we continue to expect NextEra Energy's adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate to be in a range of 6% to 8% through 2021, off our 2018 midpoint expectation of $7.70 per share, and assuming the Gulf Power, Florida City Gas, and natural gas plant transactions closed, that they will be $0.15 and $0.20 accretive to our 2020 and 2021 adjusted EPS expectations, respectively. As a result, subject to closing the transactions, we expect our 2020 adjusted EPS expectations to be in a range of $8.70 to $9.20, and our 2021 adjusted EPS expectations to be in a range of $9.40 to $9.95 per share. We continue to believe that we have one of the best growth opportunity sets in our industry and will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our 6% to 8% compound annual growth rate range off our expected 2018 base of $7.70 per share, plus the expected accretion from these transactions. We also expect that from 2018 to 2021, operating cash flow will grow roughly in line with our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. We continue to expect to grow our dividends per share 12% to 14% per year through at least 2020, off a 2017 base of dividends per share of $3.93. As always, our expectations are subject to the usual caveats, including but not limited to normal weather and operating conditions. As I previously discussed, at the anticipated rating agency credit metrics thresholds following the Gulf Power transactions closing, we expect to maintain $5 billion to $7 billion of excess balance sheet capacity through 2021. We will look to utilize the remaining balance sheet capacity to either buy back shares or opportunistically execute on accretive, incremental capital investments or accretive acquisition opportunities if it makes sense to do so. As a reminder, the remaining excess balance sheet capacity serves as a cushion, as its utilization is not currently assumed in our financial expectations. Earlier this month, we were pleased to mitigate potential interest rate volatility on future NextEra Energy debt issuances by entering into a $3 billion interest rate hedge agreement, which is incremental to the interest rate hedge that was executed for Gulf Power, Florida City Gas, and two natural gas plant acquisitions. Under the agreement, on any date until July 12, 2028, NextEra Energy has the flexibility to effectively enter into a 10-year interest rate swap at a fixed rate of 3.1164% in any amount up to the $3 billion in total. Any unutilized balance as of July 12, 2028, will be cash settled, hedging rates at that time through 2038. We expect that the swap will help NextEra Energy maintain its relative cost-of-capital advantage going forward. In summary, after a strong start to the year, we remain well-positioned to achieve our $7.70 adjusted EPS target for 2018, as well as our long-term financial expectations. At FPL, we continue to focus on delivering our best-in-class customer value proposition through operational cost-effectiveness and making smart long-term capital investments. This focus, combined with the economic tailwind supporting the Florida economy and the constructive regulatory environment, position us well for continued growth going forward. At Energy Resources, we maintain significant competitive advantages to capitalize on the increasingly strong market for renewables development. By leveraging these strengths, as well as NextEra Energy's operating model and significant balance sheet capacity, we believe NextEra Energy is uniquely positioned in the sector to drive long-term shareholder value, as we have highlighted with the Gulf Power and Florida City Gas transactions. We remain intensely focused on execution and are as enthusiastic as ever about our future prospects. Let me now turn to NEP. NextEra Energy Partners continued the strong start to 2018 with year-over-year growth in both adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution of approximately 29% and 37%, respectively, reflecting new asset additions during 2017 and outstanding underlying performance of the portfolio. Yesterday, the NEP board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.4375 per common unit, or $1.75 per common unit on an annualized basis, up 15% from a year earlier. Late in the second quarter, NEP closed the sale of its Canadian portfolio of wind and solar projects, generating net proceeds of approximately $573 million U.S., subject to post-closing working capital adjustments. This transaction, which was executed at an attractive 10-year CAFD yield of 6.6%, inclusive of the present value of the O&M origination fee, highlights the underlying value of NEP's renewable assets. We expect to accretively redeploy the proceeds into higher-yielding U.S. acquisitions to support NEP's long-term growth. Additionally, by investing the proceeds into U.S. assets that benefit from a lower effective corporate tax rate and a longer tax yield versus Canada, NEP can retain more cash available for distribution in the future for every $1 invested, which in turn is expected to provide a longer runway for LP distribution growth. We are extremely pleased with the execution of this transaction and look forward to redeploying the proceeds later this year to support NEP's growth expectations. Let me now review the detailed results for NEP, which reflect outstanding financial performance for the quarter. NEP's second quarter adjusted EBITDA of approximately $253 million increased $57 million from a year earlier. Second quarter cash available for distribution was approximately $150 million, an increase of $31 million from the prior-year comparable quarter. Adjusted EBITDA and CAFD growth of 29% and 37%, respectively, was primarily driven by growth in the underlying portfolio. Contributions from new projects were the principal driver of growth, adding $48 million of adjusted EBITDA and $21 million of cash available for distribution. Existing projects also contributed favorably to the significant growth in adjusted EBITDA and CAFD, primarily as a result of increased contributions from the Texas pipelines. Cash available for distributions also benefited from the timing of debt service payments due to the senior unsecured notes that were issued in the third quarter of last year. As a reminder, these results are net of IDR fees, since we treat these as an operating expense. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide. As we announced last quarter, from the base of our fourth quarter 2017 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $1.62, we see 12% to 15% per year growth in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2023, subject to our usual caveats. As a result, we expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2018 distribution that is payable in February 2019 to be in a range of $1.81 to $1.86 per common unit. NextEra Energy Partners continues to expect the December 31, 2018, run rate for adjusted EBITDA of $1 billion to $1.15 billion and CAFD of $360 million to $400 million, reflecting calendar year 2019 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at year-end 2018. We are pleased with NEP's strong start to 2018. The significant growth in adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution are supported by the long-term contracted cash flows, backed by strong counterparty credits of the high-quality underlying portfolio. NEP's flexibility to grow in three ways – acquiring assets from Energy Resources, organically, or acquiring assets from other third parties – provides clear visibility to support its growth going forward. With what we view as the best renewables development period in our history, as reflected by the outstanding origination success that Energy Resources continues to have, NEP's already best-in-class distribution growth visibility will further improve over the coming years. Additionally, NEP's cost of capital and access to capital advantages provide substantial flexibility to finance its long-term growth without a need to sell common equity until 2020 at the earliest, other than modest at-the-market issuances. These strengths, combined with NEP's favorable tax position and enhanced governance rights, help provide a best-in-class investor value proposition and leave NEP well-positioned to meet its long-term financial expectations. For these reasons, NEP is as well-positioned as it's ever been, and we look forward to continued strong performance going forward. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we will open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. Our first question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Josephine Moore - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Good morning, everyone. It's Josephine here. Hope you're all well.
John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Hey, Josephine. How are you?
Josephine Moore - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Good. So of course the recent ITC is clearly a huge positive. But could you guys discuss the implications for SoBRA at FPL and the timing on the regulatory filings? And then maybe also on NEER, is there a potential for a shift of demand out of 2019, into the early 2020s given the greater latitude from the safe harboring?
John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Yeah. So with respect to the filings for FPL, remember with the SoBRA mechanism, we have the ability to construct up to 300 megawatts a year. And then anything that is under 75 megawatts does not fall under the purview of the siting act. Does that answer your question, Jolene (sic) [Josephine], on that piece?
Josephine Moore - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yeah -
John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: And I'm sorry, your second question -
Josephine Moore - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yeah, NEER.
John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Go ahead.
Josephine Moore - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: So is there a possibility for some demand shift out of 2019 into the early 2020s?
John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Well – you mean with regard to solar? Yeah. So with the ITC extension that we see, obviously that really positions the company well for continued growth, not only this decade but well into the next decade. So we are actively developing our safe harbor plans for 2019, which will continue to support our growth through 2023 on the solar side. But, as you can see from our results on our origination efforts this quarter, we continue to see very strong interest in solar, particularly when we combine it with a storage option. That has been a very attractive product for our customers. So while you may see a bit of a step function like what we've seen in wind as you move well into the next decade, we don't anticipate any material drop-off in demand for solar or solar-plus-storage installations through the end of this decade.
Josephine Moore - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. Great. And then on the Gulf Power acquisition, do you think that there's a possibility to bring Gulf Power closer to the regulatory metrics – i.e., equity ratio, ROEs, reserve amortization – enjoyed by FPL?
John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Yeah. Our plan is to operate Gulf under the terms and conditions of its current settlement agreement. And that is what is included in our base case and what we said on our last call, with our expectations to be able to grow Gulf, Florida City Gas, and the two gas plants on a combined basis at roughly 16%, which is the high end of our expectations for adjusted EPS growth for NextEra Energy from 2018 through 2021.
Josephine Moore - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: So any such changes would then be incremental to the accretion numbers we're seeing right now?
John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Any changes would be incremental, but again our base case is to operate under the current settlement agreement that's in place for Gulf.
Josephine Moore - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay, great. And then just one last question. Could we get an update on Project Accelerate and how that's tracking and outlook for 2019?
John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Yeah. So as we said at the Analyst Day in 2017, that was an opportunity to generate roughly $425 million of run rate savings beginning in 2019. The project continues to progress extremely well. And we continue to look for even further O&M savings opportunities across the business. We're only getting started. There are a number of opportunities for us to continue to drive cost savings across the business by leveraging technologies and applying smarter approaches to how we conduct our business. And so the company is constantly engaged on a mission of continuously improving our cost structure. And so Project Accelerate 1 is only the beginning.
Josephine Moore - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. Great. Well, that's all for me. Thank you very much.
John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Stephen C. Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning and congratulations on the good results.
John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Oh, thank you, Stephen.
Stephen C. Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Wanted to just follow up on storage. You had provided some good commentary in your prepared remarks around storage. But just stepping back, I know you, at your analyst event, laid out your trajectory on where you see costs going. I guess we continue to get surprised just by how cheap storage is becoming, but I'm just curious from what you're seeing out in the marketplace for storage, is the trajectory at all surprising to you in terms of the cost reductions? Where can it head from here? What's your general outlook on where costs may go for storage?
John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, the way I think about it, Stephen, is how we've been pricing it into our PPAs. I mean, roughly on transactions we've done over the last six to 12 months, you can think of it as roughly $0.015 a kilowatt hour. That is probably going to move, with what we see with the significant investment being made in electric vehicles and the cost declines that we expect to see on the solar side. Early in the next decade, mid-next decade, it's going to probably be about $0.005 a kilowatt hour add, maybe $0.01, but probably closer to about $0.005. And so if we find ourselves in a marketplace where we are selling wind right around $0.02, I mean, a combined wind and solar product probably looks roughly around $0.025. Solar, into the next decade, probably looks more like a $0.03 product, sub-$0.03 in some markets. You add half a penny on that on the high end, you're probably at about $ 0.035 a kilowatt hour. Depends on the market and land costs.
Stephen C. Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's really helpful.
James L. Robo - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Hey, Stephen. This is Jim. I just wanted to add something to what John said. So we've been doing some work recently on thinking about what is firm. And that's a little bit of an existential question, and it depends on obviously the size of the market and kind of the individual characteristics of the generation in those markets. But our thinking is for the first 5 gigawatts in the country, firm – a two-hour battery is probably firm for the first five gigawatts of battery penetration, maybe three hours. It depends again on the characteristics of the site. And then, as you get to penetration levels of 15% in the country, we see firm battery storage of four hours is about right to really make it firm and make it look a lot like a peaker. So there's a lot of work that we're doing, kind of pushing the ball forward on how we think about – because it's not just what the cost is. It's also what the application is, and how you use the storage, and also the streams of value that you can put against it. That's just the capacity value. And obviously there's a bunch of other streams of value that essentially buy down the cost of that battery relative to making it, quote-unquote, "firm" in a system context. So a lot of really interesting work that's going on right now, and we're right at the beginning of, I think, a real revolution in this country in terms of how electricity is – how storage interacts with electricity on the grid, and how we're going to start delivering much different, firm, renewable products to our customers going forward.
Stephen C. Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Well, that's really helpful, Jim and John. And maybe, Jim, just adding to that, you've talked in the past about the combination of wind and solar and storage and sort of the – I guess I'd call it the unique big-data capabilities you have to have and understanding how those three products work together. Is that something you still view as a competitive advantage? Do you see new entrants there? What's the real sort of barriers to entry around being able to master the combination of those three things?
James L. Robo - NextEra Energy, Inc.: I think there's an enormous amount of intellectual work that's going on, intellectual content that's going on, around that. And big data is just a part of it. But we have a lot of capabilities in that area. Literally, have now hundreds of data scientists working on several big data applications in our business. I've been talking about how obviously providing firm renewables is one activity where you really need big data to understand how to do that. The other, honestly, is wind O&M and availability, and a third is grid ops. And we have folks working on all three of those things and are generating new ideas and new applications every day. And so it's actually one of the really exciting pieces of what we're doing now with Project Accelerate, and really the second phase of Project Accelerate that we launched this year was a big focus on artificial intelligence and big data.
Stephen C. Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Very good. I'll let others speak. Thanks so much.
John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Stephen.
Operator: Our next question comes from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Durgesh Chopra - Evercore Group LLC: Good morning, guys. It's actually Durgesh on for Greg. How are you?
James L. Robo - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Good. How are you, Durgesh?
Durgesh Chopra - Evercore Group LLC: Good. Just two quick follow-ups. We had a few questions on storage, but you guys have given a very detailed overview, so I'm not going to bog you down for that. On the MVP pipeline, just to clarify, are you saying that with – given what you're seeing, you still think that you can bring that into service by Q1 2019. Did I hear that correctly?
John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: You did.
Durgesh Chopra - Evercore Group LLC: Okay. And then your share of investment in that pipeline is $1 billion, correct?
John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: $1.1 billion.
Durgesh Chopra - Evercore Group LLC: And just one quick 1B and maybe I missed this, the income tax rule, the unfavorable income tax rule that was driving corporate (41:45) unfavorable this quarter. What was that again?
John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: I'm sorry. Say that again, Durgesh.
Durgesh Chopra - Evercore Group LLC: So there was a – you'd mentioned in your commentary -
John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Oh, yeah. The 172(f) court ruling. So we had an adverse court decision under Internal Revenue Code Section 172(f), which basically allows us to carry back net operating losses on decommissioning costs for nuclear plants back to the date when the nuclear plant was first put into service. And we took the position that spent nuclear fuel disposal fees that we have been paying to the DOE would qualify under that unlimited carryback provision. We did not prevail on that position.
Durgesh Chopra - Evercore Group LLC: I see. So you've taken that – basically have trued up that charge. Is that truly one-time?
John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: That is one-time. It's $0.06. And obviously had that $0.06 not occurred, what was a strong quarter would have been even a stronger quarter.
Durgesh Chopra - Evercore Group LLC: Awesome. Thanks again.
Operator: Our next question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.
Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Hey. Good morning, guys.
John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Good morning, Shar.
Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Apologize. I jumped in a little bit late here. I just want to confirm on sort of the rate proceeding comments. With the reserve amortization, you expect to stay out of a rate case at FP&L through 2022. Is that correct?
John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Yes, the potential is to stay out up to 2022.
Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Okay. Got it. And then assuming you hit your regulatory ROE by the third quarter, can you just – what's the reserve balance by year-end?
John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Shar, we haven't said, but obviously that reserve balance starts to reverse, creating a surplus position. And our view is that we would have sufficient surplus by the end of 2020 to stay out potentially up to one to two years through 2022.
Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Okay. Got it. And then just on Gulf Power, so you're going to support the settlement that's out there. And then is it fair to assume, following the tenor of the settlement, you'll likely file a GRC to at least true up sort of the regulatory construct and sort of the ROEs that you're afforded at FP&L at Gulf Power?
John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Yeah. Our focus right now is closing the transaction and moving forward and applying the FPL operating model to Gulf within the confines of Gulf's current settlement agreement. So no plans right now to revisit any of the terms or conditions in the Gulf settlement agreement.
Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Got it. Okay. And then just lastly, on your $7 billion of borrowing capacity, can you just provide maybe a little bit more context on sort of what could be interesting as you sort of think about the opportunity set out there? Has additional midstream opportunities sort of opened up around the Midwest/Southeast region that could provide some of that source or more electric opportunities, co-ops, or – I guess what seems to be interesting as you guys are looking out there?
John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Well, the focus is going to continue to be on regulated M&A, not on midstream opportunities. And so, when we think about regulated M&A, the first thing we think about is constructive regulatory jurisdictions. The second thing we think about is the opportunity to really derive value and apply the FPL playbook through generation modernization, the ability to operate the business efficiently. And when you look at all of those things and you put those things together in particularly regulatory environments, the targets would be in the Midwest and in the Southeast as being the most attractive alternatives for us.
Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Okay. All right. Thanks so much, guys.
John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Yep. Thanks, Shar.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Pardon me. Michael?
Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Just curious – sorry. Where do you see returns being better? Meaning, is there a significant difference at all in the returns for repowered wind projects versus new-builds? And also, when you're doing a repowering, are you usually contracting back to the existing counterparty that had the original contract, or is this a, kind of, open up to market and whoever comes to the table type of environment?
John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Yeah. So, first of all, the returns are a little better, right? Because we're typically blending and extending the contract. You're restarting the PTC clock, but you're making half the capital investment that you would typically have to make in a new-build scenario. And in terms of contracting, we're always trying to work with the existing counterparty.
Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: A follow-up for utility-scale solar development in the U.S. just in general. What states, or what parts of the country, where currently there isn't a lot of utility scale solar kind of on the ground operating are you starting to get more and more customer or client interest in potential new development over the next three to five years? Like where are kind of the new opportunity sets geographically starting to pop up where they haven't really been before?
John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: I'll turn that over to Armando.
Armando Pimentel - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Hey, Michael; it's Armando. Honestly, it's popping up everywhere. I know you're looking for something more specific. It's easy to say that there are many more opportunities outside the West and the Southwest U.S. than there were just a couple years ago, but I can't really point you to one specific place. We're seeing a lot of activity in the Southeast. We're seeing actually a lot of activity in the Upper Midwest. And we're seeing a lot of activity up in the Northeast. So all places that that we've been investing in probably for the last couple years in terms of land and interconnects and so on. I mean, places where we feel that we can enter into long-term off-take agreements also.
Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated.
John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Thanks, Michael.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Maheep Mandloi - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. This is Maheep on behalf of Michael Weinstein. Thanks for taking the questions. Just on NextEra's $5 billion to $7 billion borrowing capacity, could you talk about if the Moody's recent sector downgrade has affected your view on the borrowing capacity?
John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: No. it has not.
Maheep Mandloi - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): And just as a follow-up, do you expect a breathing period as you integrate Gulf Power and Florida City Gas (49:40) into the core business, or when can we expect more M&A announcements going forwards?
John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Yeah. It's going to be opportunistic. But again, Gulf will be run as a separate business from FPL.
Maheep Mandloi - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): And just a question on NextEra Energy Partners. The Canada asset sale closed a month ago. So how far are you along, job done (50:11) to recycle capital into the U.S. assets? Is it kind a Q3 event or Q4 event? How should we think about that?
John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: I wouldn't want to specify or lock down a quarter, but obviously it's something that we continue to spend a significant amount of time evaluating, and we'll make further announcements coming forward.
Maheep Mandloi - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Got it. And just one last question from me. On the solar safe harboring, how should we think about – to safe harbor, like we have some guidance around wind, where you safe harbor multi-gigawatts of turbines to capture the tax credits. Should we think about sort of in the same line or the same lines for NextEra Energy Resources?
John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Yeah. No, absolutely. I mean, we will engage in an active safe harbor program, just as we did for wind. And I think the fact that we have a strong balance sheet with significant capital resources is just one more competitive advantage as you think about the ability to actively exercise our position in the safe harbor program.
Maheep Mandloi - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks for taking the questions.
Operator: Our next question comes from Christopher Turnure with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Christopher Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Good morning, guys. As the focus here recently has clearly shifted to the solar side of the business, I wanted to circle back on your latest thoughts on the wind market origination of non-repowered assets versus repowering itself and kind of how things are maybe trending versus your expectations a year ago on total number of megawatts, returns, capital deployment, et cetera.
James L. Robo - NextEra Energy, Inc.: So, you've – I mean, I think that's right. It seems like analysts and investors want to talk more about solar and storage than wind. But the fact is we're going to build, we're going to originate, and we're going to build a heck of a lot more wind from now through the end of the decade, through the end of 2020, than on the solar side. I think what's happened on the solar side is exciting, especially when you see what prices are doing in 2020 and beyond. And the fact that there's been an extension of the investment tax credit through 2023, I think it's terrific for that market. But the fact is that wind is still much cheaper than solar in many of the states up and down the Midwest, where utilities, munis, co-ops, and even the C&I sector is looking for cheap, long-term power output. And wind remains really our staple product in order to deliver to those folks that are looking for really low energy prices. So my expectation is that we're going to originate and we're going to build a lot of wind through 2020, and even as the PTC starts phasing down that you're going to see us build a lot of wind in the next decade.
Christopher Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Excellent. And then my only other question was a follow-up on the FPL reg amortization and the tax strategy there. I know the tax docket's open. Can you give us a sense of the next steps to expect from you in that process?
John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Yeah. Again, I think the fact that we were able to apply our surplus against the Irma storm surcharge was a way to accelerate the return of tax savings back to Florida customers, and I think has been well-received. I think that strategy – I commend the FPL team for the thinking there. And I think we're very well-positioned heading into hearings, which are going to occur in February 2019.
Christopher Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Abe Azar with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Abe C. Azar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning. Congratulations on the strong quarter. John, can you provide -
John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Thanks, Abe.
Abe C. Azar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: No problem. Can you provide a bit more detail on the base revenue, cost management line item at FPL, and should we expect an uplift of that size in future quarters?
John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Yeah, so with regard to base revenues, we have benefited from stronger weather during the period. And from an O&M standpoint, I mean, that really rolls right into Project Accelerate, which we've talked a little bit about. But all the opportunity that we have with Accelerate 1 with the $425 million of run rate savings on O&M, a good part of that being over at FPL, and then the Accelerate 2 initiatives that Jim described and the ability to not only leverage automation and looking at AI, looking at machine learning, looking at better, more cost-efficient ways to continue to run our business. So I would expect to continue to see very strong execution on O&M reductions for FPL going forward.
Abe C. Azar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks. My other questions were answered already.
John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer & Company. Please go ahead.
Colin Rusch - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks so much. Can you guys talk about lead times for energy storage sales and then also the pass-through of commodities from suppliers on those storage sales and how much exposure you have on that?
James L. Robo - NextEra Energy, Inc.: So your first question was lead time for storage sales. The lead time is actually fairly long. So we're responding, we have been responding, and we continue to respond to requests for folks that are looking at – most of the current requests, it's folks who are looking for storage products in the 2021 and 2022 time periods. So that doesn't surprise us. That is a little longer, but not much longer than the sales time that you're seeing for solar, which has always been longer than wind. And the primary reason for that is the cost curve for storage and solar is dropping a little bit faster – not much faster but a little bit faster – than it is for wind. And folks are looking – they're weighing the opportunity that they need the storage, with the fact that price may be a little cheaper if you just wait another year. So we're having good results right now in the 2021 and 2022 time periods for both solar and storage. And wind has always been a much nearer product, and we're responding primarily on wind with 2019 and 2020 opportunities.
Colin Rusch - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: And then the commodity exposure within the sale pricing?
James L. Robo - NextEra Energy, Inc.: I think in the near term – so there's been certainly a lot of discussion about cobalt in particular, which is obviously in the chemistry of the batteries. And in the near term, there might be some cobalt price pressures and so on. We're taking a little longer look in the next couple years simply because we expect a battery market, energy storage market, in the next couple years, but we really expect it to be something in the next decade. And we continue to believe that all of these little blips – whether it's cobalt or some other chemistry – all of these little blips will get taken care of, and battery cost curves will just continue to come down.
Colin Rusch - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then just on the solar procurement side, obviously the safe harbor clarification – it hasn't been too long since that's come about. But how much more procurement are you going to need to do to get your safe harbor volumes to the levels that you want over the next couple of quarters next year? Are you pretty much there at this point, or do you have a fair amount of contracting left to do?
James L. Robo - NextEra Energy, Inc.: So we'll have more to say on that as the year pans out and early next year. Obviously we have time to figure out what our strategy is through 2023. So I think it's a little early to determine exactly what our additional resource or CapEx needs are going to be. But as John indicated a couple of minutes ago, we are in a terrific position to be able to take advantage of the safe harboring for solar, and we will take advantage of it. It's just a little early to talk about what that means.
Colin Rusch - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: All right. Perfect. Thanks, guys.
Operator: This concludes our question and answer session. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2018 Q1  (2018-04-24 12:00:00) =====
Matthew Roskot: [Audio Gap] 
  Thank you, Bryan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter 2018 combined earnings conference call for NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. With me this morning are Jim Robo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; John Ketchum, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; Armando Pimentel, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources; and Mark Hickson, Executive Vice President of NextEra Energy, all of whom are also officers of NextEra Energy Partners; as well as Eric Silagy, President and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light Company. John will provide an overview of our results, and our executive team will then be available to answer your questions.
 We will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call, in the Risk Factors section of the accompanying presentation on our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found in our websites, nexteraenergy.com and nexteraenergypartners.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements.
 Today's presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of historical non-GAAP measures to the closest GAAP financial measure.
 With that, I will turn the call over to John. 
John Ketchum: Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy delivered strong first quarter results, and is off to a solid start towards meeting its objectives for the year.
 Adjusted earnings per share increased almost 11% against the prior year comparable quarter, reflecting successful performance at both Florida Power & Light and Energy Resources. FPL increased earnings per share $0.07 from the prior year comparable period. Regulatory capital employed grew approximately 12.9% year-over-year, and all of our major capital initiatives remain on track. 
 During the quarter, FPL successfully commissioned nearly 600 megawatts of cost-effective solar projects under the Solar Base Rate Adjustment, or SoBRA, mechanism of our settlement agreement as well as the largest combined solar-plus-storage project in operation in the United States. Additionally, the Florida Public Service Commission unanimously approved FPL's petition for determination of need for the Dania Beach Clean Energy Center, further advancing the roughly 1,200-megawatt project through the regulatory approval process.
 FPL continued to deliver on its best-in-class customer value proposition of low bills, high reliability and outstanding customer service. As announced on our last call, FPL was able to pass the benefits of tax reform back to customers immediately by foregoing recovery of the $1.3 billion in surcharges related to Hurricane Irma. And as a result, the average of 1,000 kilowatt hour residential bill was reduced by $3.35 per month beginning March 1, as the surcharge related to Hurricane Matthew rolled off.
 FPL's typical residential bill is now nearly 30% below the national average, and the lowest among all of the Florida IOUs. Our ongoing efforts to invest in a stronger and smarter grid to further improve the already outstanding efficiency and reliability of our system resulted in FPL delivering its best ever service reliability in 2017, ranking it among the top of all major utility companies in Florida.
 At Energy Resources, the lower federal income tax rate and increased contributions from our repowered wind projects helped drive growth for the quarter. Consistent with what we have previously characterized as the best renewables development period in Energy Resources' history, we had one of our most successful quarters of new wind and solar generation origination, adding more than 1,000 megawatts of projects to our backlog. We were also pleased with the progress of our natural gas pipeline development efforts, with MVP commencing construction and announcing its first expansion opportunity off the mainline pipe, which I will discuss in more detail in a moment. At this early point in the year, we are very pleased with our progress at both FPL and Energy Resources. 
 Now let's look at the detailed results beginning with FPL. For the first quarter of 2018, FPL reported net income of $484 million or $1.02 per share. Earnings per share increased $0.07 or approximately 7% year-over-year. As a reminder, rather than seek recovery from customers of the approximately $1.3 billion in Hurricane Irma storm restoration costs, FPL plans to recover these costs through federal tax savings generated during its current settlement agreement. During the fourth quarter of 2017, FPL utilized its remaining available reserve amortization to offset nearly all of the expense associated with the write off of the regulatory asset related to Irma cost recovery, ending the year with a $0 reserve amortization balance.
 Consistent with our expectations, the tax savings generated during the first quarter did not fully offset the reserve amortization required to achieve our target regulatory ROE of 11.6%. As a result, our reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.2% for the 12 months ended March 2018. This is above the ROE expectations we shared on our fourth quarter earnings conference call and is due to warmer-than-normal weather and reduced O&M expenses driven by our continued focus on cost management.
 After a strong quarter, we now expect FPL to achieve its target regulatory ROE of 11.6% either late in the second or early in the third quarter on a trailing 12-month basis and subject to the usual caveats. Based upon our weather-normalized sales forecast and current CapEx and O&M expectations, we expect to begin partially restoring the reserve amortization balance through tax savings later this year and continue to expect that FPL will end 2020 with a sufficient amount of surplus to potentially avoid a base rate increase for up to 2 additional years. Operating under the current base rate settlement agreement would create further customer benefits by potentially avoiding a base rate increase in 2021 and 2022.
 The Florida Public Service Commission has opened separate dockets to address tax reform for each of the Florida investor-owned utilities, including FPL. We expect hearings to occur in August of this year, and look forward to working with the FPSC and other interested parties to further explain how FPL's prompt actions within the terms of the settlement agreement benefit customers.
 Regulatory capital employed grew approximately 12.9% year-over-year, and all of our major capital initiatives remain on track. As a reminder, due to tax reform, FPL will no longer take bonus depreciation of future investments, which is expected to result in an increase to investor sources of capital as the contribution from accumulated deferred income taxes decreases over time. Therefore, beginning this quarter, our presentation of FPL's regulatory capital employed is net of accumulated deferred income taxes, which is treated as 0 cost equity in our capital structure, as this more appropriately reflects the growth in FPL's earnings. In the appendix of today's presentation, we have provided a reconciliation of our historical numbers to our revised methodology. 
 Turning to our development efforts, all of our major capital projects at FPL are progressing well. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $1.2 billion in the quarter, and we expect our full year capital investments to be between $4.9 billion and $5.3 billion.
 Adding to the nearly 300 megawatts of solar projects that were placed in service in January, during the quarter, we were pleased to complete construction on schedule and under budget of the next 4 74.5-megawatt solar energy centers developed under the SoBRA mechanism of the rate case settlement agreement. The 8 solar plants that entered service in 2018 are projected to generate more than $100 million in total savings for FPL customers during their operating lifetime.
 FPL's 10-year site plan that was filed with the public service commission earlier this month included plans for more than 3,200 megawatts of additional solar projects across Florida over the coming years, including the approximately 600 megawatts that remain under the SoBRA mechanism of our settlement agreement. To support what continues to be one of the largest-ever solar expansions in the U.S., FPL has already secured almost 6 gigawatts of potential sites. 
 During the quarter, we also deployed the first 2 projects under FPL's 50-megawatt battery storage pilot program, pairing battery systems with existing solar projects. The 4-megawatt battery system with 16-megawatt hours of storage capacity was deployed at the Citrus Solar Energy Center, representing the first large-scale application of DC-coupled batteries at a solar plant in the U.S. and enabling the facility to deliver more energy to FPL's grid. Additionally, FPL installed a 10-megawatt battery project with 40-megawatt hours of storage capacity at the Babcock Ranch Solar Energy Center, creating the country's largest combined solar-plus-storage project currently in operation and highlighting FPL's innovative approach to further enhance the diversity of its clean energy solutions for customers. FPL will install additional battery storage projects to further enhance the reliability and efficiency of its system and to position FPL for future deployments as battery costs continue to decline over the coming years.
 Construction on the approximately 1,750-megawatt Okeechobee Clean Energy Center remains on schedule and on budget. As I previously mentioned, in March, the Florida Public Service Commission granted the determination of need for the Dania Beach Clean Energy Center. The approximately $900 million project is expected to begin operation in 2022 and generate nearly $350 million in net cost savings for FPL customers, while reducing air emissions by roughly 70% compared to the existing power plant.
 We continue to make significant progress with FPL's purchase of substantially all of the assets of the City of Vero Beach's municipal electric system, receiving approval for the transaction from the Orlando Utilities Commission and all 19 member cities on the FMPA Board. The transaction is now undergoing FPSC review. Pending commission approval, this transaction would represent what we believe is the first privatization of a vertically integrated electric municipal utility in the United States in more than 25 years and is reflective of FPL's collaborative efforts with the city, local and regional leaders as well as other state authorities to benefit Vero Beach's more than 34,000 customers with FPL's best-in-class value proposition.
 FPL's continued smart investment opportunities are expected to support the compound annual growth rate and regulatory capital employed of approximately 9% from the start of the settlement agreement in January 2017 through at least December 2021, while further benefiting our customers. This compound annual growth rate is higher than we have previously discussed as it now is net of declining contribution from accumulated deferred income taxes, for the reasons I mentioned earlier, which more appropriately reflects the growth in FPL's earnings.
 The Florida economy continues to show healthy results and is among the strongest in the nation. The current unemployment rate of 3.9% is near the lowest levels in a decade and remains below the national average. The real estate sector continues to grow with average building permits in the Case-Shiller Index for South Florida up 7.4% and 3.8% respectively, versus the prior year. Florida's consumer confidence level also remains near a 10-year high.
 FPL's first quarter retail sales increased 2.9% from the prior year comparable period, and we estimate that approximately 1.3% of this amount can be attributed to weather-related usage per customer. On a weather-normalized basis, first quarter sales increased 1.6% with continued customer growth and an estimated 0.7% increase in weather-normalized usage per customer both contributing favorably. While the growth in underlying usage is a reversal from the trend in recent quarters, as we have often discussed, this measure can be volatile on a quarterly basis. We will continue to closely monitor and analyze underlying usage and we'll update you on future calls.
 Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported first quarter 2018 GAAP earnings of $3.926 billion or $8.26 per share and adjusted earnings of $386 million or $0.81 per share. This quarter's GAAP results reflect certain impacts that I would like to take a moment to summarize. As we have previously discussed, due to the increased governance rights that were granted to NEP's LP unitholders, NEP was deconsolidated from NextEra Energy's financial statements beginning in January 2018. NextEra Energy now accounts for its investment in NEP on the equity method of accounting, and as a result of this change, recognized an approximately $3 billion after-tax gain or $6.32 per share during the first quarter of 2018 from recording its investment in NEP at fair value.
 The projects owned by NEP will continue to provide value to NextEra Energy over their operating lives through NextEra Energy's continued investment in NEP. Accordingly, NextEra Energy will exclude this initial gain from adjusted earnings and realize that as related projects provide an economic benefit to Energy Resources, which offsets the higher depreciation and amortization resulting from recording the investment in NEP at fair value.
 Beyond deconsolidation, in the first quarter of 2018, Energy Resources remeasured its tax equity arrangements or differential membership interests, resulting in a net after-tax gain of $484 million to reflect the impact of the newly enacted tax rates. Since this remeasurement is not expected to have an economic impact on our underlying tax equity transactions, we are excluding these tax reform-related impacts from adjusted earnings and reflecting the benefit over the original term, which we believe better reflects the economic substance of the transactions. Additional detail on these and other changes are included in the appendix of today's presentation. 
 The Energy Resources contribution to adjusted earnings per share increased by $0.05 or roughly 7% from last year's comparable quarter. With approximately 1,600 megawatts of repowered wind projects being commissioned in 2017, contributions from existing generation assets increased by $0.06 per share primarily as a result of increased PTC volume from these repowered projects.
 Contributions from new investments declined by $0.17 per share as the prior comparable quarter benefited from the timing of tax incentives on certain projects. For the full year, we expect contributions from new investments to be slightly positive.
 Contributions from our gas infrastructure business, including existing pipelines, increased by $0.06 year-over-year. As expected, the reduction in the corporate federal income tax rate was accretive to Energy Resources, increasing adjusted EPS by $0.12 compared to 2017. All other items decreased results by $0.02 per share. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide.
 As I mentioned earlier, the Energy Resources development team continues to capitalize on what we believe is the best renewables development environment in our history, adding 667 megawatts of new wind projects and 334 megawatts of new solar projects to our backlog since the last call.
 All of these 1,001 megawatts added to backlog, 34 megawatts of the solar projects and 247 megawatts of the wind projects, are for delivery this year. The accompanying chart updates information we provided on last quarter's call, but our overall expectations have not changed.
 For 2019 and 2020, we are now within the range of expectations that we have provided for solar. And for U.S. wind, our current backlog is more than half of the low end of our expected range. We continue to track well against the total development forecast for 2017 through 2020 that we shared at our investor conference last year. And with returns on energy resources renewables projects consistent with what we have previously shared, our backlog continues to track against the assumptions supporting our previously announced financial expectations.
 One of the best quarters of new renewables origination in our history is a reflection of the increasingly strong economic demand for wind and solar, which will continue to benefit from additional retirements of coal, nuclear and less fuel-efficient oil and gas-fired generation units, creating significant opportunities for renewables growth going forward. Combined with our competitive advantages in renewables development, we expect this will help drive well into the next decade, building on the nearly 300 megawatts of renewables projects we have already signed for beyond 2020.
 In addition to the progress we made with battery storage projects at FPL, yesterday, Energy Resources commissioned its first solar-plus-storage project. These projects represent the beginning of the next phase of renewables deployment that pairs low-cost wind and solar energy with a low-cost battery storage solution to provide a product that can be dispatched with enough certainty to meet customer needs for a nearly firm generation resource, all at a lower cost than that required to operate traditional inefficient generation resources.
 Beyond renewables, we were pleased to begin construction on the Mountain Valley Pipeline during the first quarter, and we continue to expect a December 2018 in-service date. Earlier this month, with project partner, EQT Corporation, we also announced the MVP Southgate project, a proposed expansion pipeline that will receive gas from the MVP mainline in Virginia and extend south to new delivery points in central North Carolina.
 The project, which is anchored by a firm capacity commitment from PSNC Energy, commenced a binding open season in order to provide additional market participants an opportunity to subscribe to the project. As currently designed, the project has a targeted in-service date of the fourth quarter 2020, subject to FERC and other regulatory approvals. We look forward to providing additional details following evaluation of the open season results.
 Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the first quarter of 2018, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $4.428 billion or $9.32 per share. NextEra Energy's 2018 first quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $919 million and $1.94 per share, respectively. Adjusted earnings from the corporate and other segment increased $0.07 per share compared to the first quarter of 2017 primarily due to certain favorable tax items and lower interest expense.
 Based on our first quarter performance at NextEra Energy, we remain comfortable with the expectations we have previously discussed for the full year, and we'll continue to target the $7.70 midpoint of our adjusted EPS range. Longer term, we continue to expect NextEra Energy's adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate to be in a range of 6% to 8% through 2021 off our 2018 expectation of $7.70 per share, all subject to our usual caveats. We continue to believe that we have one of the best growth opportunity sets in our industry, and we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our 6% to 8% range through 2021. Operating cash flow is expected to grow roughly in line with our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range from 2018 through 2021.
 As we announced in February, the board of NextEra Energy approved the 2-year extension of the existing dividend policy of targeting 12% to 14% annual growth in dividends per share. This extension is expected to result in a growth rate in dividends per share of 12% to 14% per year through at least 2020 off a 2017 base of $3.93 per share. The board's extension of this policy reflects the continued strength of adjusted earnings and operating cash flow growth at NextEra Energy. With a payout ratio of only 59% at the end of 2017, below the peer average of roughly 65%, and one of the strongest balance sheets in our sector, we remain well positioned to support the dividend policy going forward.
 Similar to the recent recognition of NextEra Energy's enhanced business risk profile by S&P and Moody's, earlier this month, Fitch announced that it was widening its sustained FFO adjusted leverage thresholds from 3.5x to 3.75x to 4x to 4.25x. At our current rating agency thresholds, we expect to have $5 billion to $7 billion of excess balance sheet capacity through 2021. We continue to expect that if the regulated contribution to our business mix improves to roughly 70%, that we would receive a further reduction to our current rating agencies thresholds from S&P and Moody's, creating additional balance sheet capacity. As a reminder, our excess balance sheet capacity serves as a cushion as its utilization is not currently assumed in our financial expectations. 
 In summary, after a strong start to the year, we continue to remain as enthusiastic as ever about NextEra Energy's future prospects. At FPL, we continue to focus on delivering our best-in-class customer value proposition through operational cost-effectiveness, productivity and making smart long-term investments to further improve the quality, reliability and efficiency of everything we do. Energy Resources maintains significant competitive advantages to capitalize on the expanding market for renewables development and continues to make strong progress on its natural gas pipeline development and construction efforts. With the strength of our credit ratings and significant balance sheet capacity, NextEra Energy is uniquely positioned to drive long-term shareholder value. We remain intensely focused on execution and on extending our long-term track record of delivering value to shareholders.
 Let me now turn to NEP. NextEra Energy Partners is also off to a strong start to 2018, with significant year-over-year growth in both adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution, reflecting new asset additions during 2017 and outstanding underlying performance of the portfolio. Yesterday, the NEP board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.42 per common unit or $1.68 per common unit on an annualized basis, up 15% from a year earlier.
 Earlier this month, NEP announced the sale of its Canadian portfolio of wind and solar projects to Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. The transaction, which was completed at an attractive 10-year average CAFD yield of 6.6%, including the net present value of the O&M origination fee, highlights the significant underlying value of NEP's portfolio and is expected to be accretive to long-term growth, as I will discuss more in a moment. We continue to expect that NEP will have no need to sell common equity until 2020 at the earliest, other than modest issuances under the ATM program, and have taken further steps to enhance our financing flexibility by opportunistically hedging our exposure to future interest rate volatility. Overall, we are pleased with the strong start to 2018 and remain focused on continuing the success going forward.
 As I just mentioned, at the end of March, NEP entered into a definitive agreement with CPPIB for the sale of its 396-megawatt Canada wind and solar portfolio. Total consideration for the portfolio is approximately USD 582 million, including the net present value of the O&M origination fee, subject to customary working capital and other adjustments, plus the assumption by the purchaser of approximately USD 689 million in existing debt. The foreign currency exchange rate has been hedged for the transaction, which is expected to close in the second quarter of this year, subject to receipt of regulatory approvals and satisfaction of customary closing conditions.
 When the agreement was executed in the first quarter, it accelerated payment by Energy Resources to NEP of an approximately USD 30 million note receivable, which was acquired by NEP with the Jericho wind project. This note receivable is not included in the sale to CPPIB. The sale price of the portfolio represents an attractive 10-year average CAFD yield of 6.6%, inclusive of the net present value of the O&M origination fee, highlighting the underlying value of NEP's renewable assets. We expect to be able to accretively redeploy the proceeds into higher-yielding U.S. acquisitions from Energy Resources or third parties to support NEP's long-term growth.
 With a lower effective corporate tax rate and a longer tax shield in the U.S. versus Canada, NEP can retain more cash available for distribution in the future for every $1 invested into U.S. assets, which in turn is expected to provide a longer runway for FPL -- for limited partner distribution growth. As a result, today, we are pleased to announce that we are extending our financial expectations for NEP another year as we see 12% to 15% per year growth and per-unit distributions as a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2023.
 Let me now review the detailed results for NEP, which reflect the outstanding operational and financial performance for the quarter. Including the benefit from the acceleration of the Jericho note receivable that I just described, first quarter adjusted EBITDA was $258 million, and cash available for distribution was $95 million, up roughly 52% and 138%, respectively, against the prior year comparable quarter. Excluding the impact of this payment, growth remains very strong, with adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution increasing approximately 34% and 63%, respectively, year-over-year.
 Contributions from portfolio acquisitions were the principal driver of growth. New projects added $49 million of adjusted EBITDA and $32 million of cash available for distribution. Existing projects also contributed favorably primarily as a result of contracting activity at one of the Texas pipelines. 
 For the NEP portfolio, wind resource was also favorable at 105% of the long-term average versus 99% in the first quarter of 2017. Cash available for distribution reflects $17 million of higher debt service due to the timing of payments related to the senior unsecured notes that were issued in the third quarter of last year. As a reminder, these results are net of IDR fees since we treat these as an operating expense. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide.
 NEP's portfolio of long-dated amortizing project-level debt helps to limit interest rate exposure. During the quarter, we were pleased to further mitigate potential interest rate volatility and enhance NEP's significant financing flexibility with a $5 billion interest rate hedge agreement. Under the agreement, at any date until March 26, 2028, NEP has the flexibility to effectively enter into a 10-year interest rate swap at a fixed rate of 3.192% in any amount up to the $5 billion total. Any unutilized balance as of March 26, 2028, will be cash settled, hedging rates at that time through 2038. The swap, which is reflective of the long-term approach we continue to take with NEP, together with amortizing project-level debt, will help limit interest rate exposure going forward and is expected to help maintain NEP's relative cost of capital advantage compared to MLPs and other yieldcos.
 NextEra Energy Partners continues to expect a December 31, 2018, run rate for adjusted EBITDA of $1 billion to $1.15 billion and CAFD of $360 million to $400 million, reflecting calendar year 2019 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at year-end 2018. As I just mentioned, from a base of our fourth quarter 2017 distribution per common unit, at an annualized rate of $1.62, we now see 12% to 15% per year growth in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2023, subject to our usual caveats. As a result, we expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2018 distribution, that is payable in February 2019, to be in the range of $1.81 to $1.86 per common unit.
 We are pleased with NEP's strong start to 2018. We believe NEP continues to provide a best-in-class investor value proposition with the flexibility to grow in 3 ways: acquiring assets from Energy Resources, organically or acquiring assets from other third parties. NEP's cost of capital and access to capital advantages, which have even further improved relative to other yieldcos and MLPs, position NEP well to support its growth going forward. These advantages, combined with the stability of NEP's long-term contracted cash flows, backed by strong counterparty credits, favorable tax position and enhanced governance rights, leave NEP well positioned to meet its long-term financial expectations and enhance unitholder value.
 That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we will now open the line for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. 
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: So I just wanted to follow up a little bit. Clearly, there's been a lot of discussion out in the marketplace of late. I'd just be curious, first, with respect to your balance sheet, can you elaborate a little bit more and perhaps define more precisely the additional balance sheet latitude that you alluded to from the rating agencies? And then perhaps to the extent to which you can elaborate on acquisitions, how do you think about utilizing that additional latitude? Do you think about maintaining a buffer, even kind of pro forma, any kind of acquisition? Effectively, how much is this new dry powder or the cumulative dry powder that you have? 
John Ketchum: Yes. So essentially the $5 billion to $7 billion results as a -- from taking our downgrade threshold metric with S&P to 23%. And what we have said is that we have more latitude if we are further able to improve our regulated business mix. So depending on the size of a potential opportunity, if we add more regulated business mix, that gets us close to 70% regulated. That gives us an opportunity to move from 23% down to a lower amount with S&P, and to also further improve on our current downgrade threshold metric with Moody's, which is currently at 20%. I'm not right now going to frame how much excess balance sheet capacity that actually creates for us. But needless to say, it would provide more than an ample buffer going forward. 
James Robo: Julien, this is Jim. The only thing I'd add to that is I think you asked how close to the thresholds would we ever run the business given an acquisition. And I think 2 things about that: One is, is that we would never do anything that isn't accretive and doesn't make sense. And we've been very disciplined about this, and we will continue to be disciplined. And then secondly, we value a strong balance sheet and a -- and our strong credit ratings. And we're not going to do anything that puts that at risk, which would include, I think, and I think you're seeing some of the implications of that in -- playing out in the sector this year with -- as a result of kind of unexpected cash flow impacts. As a result of tax reform, folks have had a -- there's been some equity pressure and some balance sheet pressure on a lot of our peers. And our thinking about how we manage our businesses is not to manage it on a razor's edge from a balance sheet capacity and credit strengthening standpoint either. So it has to be accretive, and we're going to continue to have a very strong credit as a very important part of our strategy going forward. 
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. Let me just pick up on that last point quickly. Obviously, there's been a lot of movement in the midstream side of the sector as well. You all have been very specific about looking at regulated opportunities given the additional balance sheet latitude afforded out of that. But is midstream something that you all are kind of evaluating anew? Or are the credit concerns there so pervasive that again, that largely remains off the radar screen in terms of what you are evaluating? 
John Ketchum: Yes. I mean I think on the midstream side, midstream creates 2 potential opportunities. But it has to be a midstream opportunity that fits within our profile. Number one, we're very focused on greenfield. We've seen a lot of success on the greenfield opportunities. We mentioned the mainline -- main pipeline expansion opportunity that we have off of MVP, so we're very happy with the greenfield success that we're seeing there. And given some of the struggles that we see in the MLP sector, I do expect us to continue to maintain a cost-of-capital advantage, whether it's on greenfield opportunities or on third-party M&A. If we're looking at third-party M&A, we're always going to be picky at NextEra Energy based on what we look at. We're going to want to see longer average term contract life. We're also going to want to see higher credit quality. You look at the pipes that we've developed, they are very high-quality pipes. We would not want to dilute the portfolio that we currently maintain. But as you look forward, certainly with pipeline opportunities, that does present chances for us perhaps at NEE and at NEP as well. Don't forget that NEP enjoys a very favorable yield, particularly what's happened to the MLP as a result of the FERC decision that was handed down 3 or 4 weeks ago, and then also the higher yields that we see many of the yieldcos trade out. So for us, we have terrific opportunities to grow NEP in 3 ways. As I mentioned, one is buying assets from Energy Resources; two is organically. But it's also encouraging to see the cost of capital advantage that I think we really maintain in both the MLP and the yieldco space. And you can expect us to be opportunistic and disciplined as to how we evaluate those opportunities going forward. 
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. So for instance, using some of the latitude created from the Canadian sales, it wouldn't be crazy to think about that going towards a midstream opportunity at the NEP level. 
John Ketchum: Well, I mean, at the NEP level, we have a number of opportunities, right? On -- from a Canadian standpoint, we have third-party opportunities that we can look at. I wouldn't isolate those to MLP opportunities. We have a lot of renewable opportunities. We have other asset opportunities that we continue to look at as well. And then, obviously, always have the opportunity to buy assets directly from NextEra Energy Resources. 
James Robo: Julien, let me just add to that, and then we're going to have to move on to the next question. I think it would be highly unlikely that you would see NEP enter into a transaction in the midstream space, right? I mean, we like what we have, but I think it would be highly unlikely that you would see us increase our exposure through an acquisition at NEP. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. 
Steven Fleishman: So just on the NEP extension of the dividend growth, another year at least. If you had to point to one driver of that, what would that be? 
John Ketchum: Yes, I mean, a couple of things: One is Canada, being able to execute the Canadian transaction at 6.6% yield, to be able to reinvest those proceeds in the U.S. under a more attractive tax regime at a higher yield, that's one opportunity. And then also all the continued success that you continue to see at Energy Resources. We are clearly in one of the best renewables environments that we've ever been in. I think that's evidenced by the fact we had one of the best quarters of origination in our history, posting over 1,000 megawatts. 
Steven Fleishman: Okay. And then just in terms of the -- maybe just to talk on the overall renewables market, I mean, there's just so many kind of high-level factors: the solar tariffs, the steel tariffs, things like that, just the core thesis of better economics and the like. Is that -- is your whole kind of thesis still in place in terms of hitting the targets and then economics beyond 2020? 
John Ketchum: Yes. No, it absolutely is. I mean, first of all, we managed around the solar tariff impact. We already bought forward our panel needs for '18 and '19, and now secured a good part of '20. We announced the JinkoSolar opportunity, where we'll be an anchor tenant on that opportunity, buying about 2.7 gigawatts of panels from Jinko at attractive prices. Because again, we are the anchor tenant on that facility. So I feel very good about the mitigation steps that we've taken on solar panels. I don't see that as being an impediment to growth for our portfolio going forward based on what we've been able to secure. When you look at steel and the wind turbine, wind turbine doesn't really use that much steel. I mean, the steel is in the tower. The tower is all manufactured domestically. And if you look at the blades themselves, there's just not a whole lot of steel there. So not really much of a meaningful impact to wind. And then when you look at solar, the solar panel itself doesn't contain aluminum or steel, just some in the racking. That's a very small impact overall. Then when you look at the economics of the renewable market today, we truly enjoy a competitive advantage that has not changed: the buying power that we have on the O&M side; the continued productivity that we see on reduced O&M cost, which is only benefits from having the largest renewables operation in North America, which is very scalable; the cost of capital advantage that we maintain. We don't have to pursue expensive construction financing. We can balance sheet finance our wind and solar build and then term it out with access to the tax equity market or project financing. We have not seen anything on the tax equity side to suggest any compression that would affect our build. Again, we have first call on that market. If anything, we see tax equity prices fall, which has been a nice benefit. And then the last piece is just you benefit by having a large portfolio because you get much higher [indiscernible] correlated information as to new sites that you can build upon, which really helps with top line growth going forward. And when you throw into the mix the expertise that we've developed on the battery side, I feel very good about the competitive advantages that we have on renewables. 
Armando Pimentel: Steve, just a second. The only thing that John didn't cover was volume, really. I mean, he covered all the points that we're seeing as really driving costs down, which are, obviously, helpful to the economics. But the volume piece, I mean, there is a lot of volume, right, in the industry right now. I mean, we are pricing some very large renewable projects at this point. I don't think we've -- I'm sure we've never seen the volume out in the market that we're seeing. And so it makes us pretty happy about the future. 
Steven Fleishman: Just, Armando, when you say volume, you mean large scale, like RFPs, so to speak. Or... 
Armando Pimentel: Yes, there's just a lot of RFPs out in the market, both of the traditional utilities and C&I companies. And we're pricing -- we continue to price projects in 2018, but we are going out as far as 2022 at this point in pricing projects. 
John Ketchum: Yes, and that's a good point that Armando brought up on volume, because the other point that I want to make is around capital deployment. We are deploying as much capital as we have ever deployed in this business. You guys have seen the numbers from our Analyst Day, $10 billion to $11 billion a year between both businesses. And renewables, obviously, makes up a big piece of that. We have not seen a change in the returns that we have previously communicated to investors. I mean, we see unlevered IRRs in wind kind of high-single digits, unlevered in the high teens, low 20s; solar, a couple hundred bps below on the unlevered IRR and mid-teens on the ROEs. And those are numbers we've been communicating to investors for a long time. And because of all the competitive advantages that we have in the sector, notwithstanding tax reform, we've been able to make up for some of the impacts on bonus depreciation and preserving those returns. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Greg Gordon with Evercore. 
Greg Gordon: Can you just talk about the cadence of the earnings at NextEra and Energy Resources over the course of the year? It is somewhat unusual for you guys to have a $0.17 drag in the first quarter from new developments. I looked back at the last couple of years' worth of Q1 releases, just to sort of scan it, and it does look like an outlier. So is there a unique sort of circumstances this year that's driving the shape of the earnings contribution this year? 
John Ketchum: Yes. You got to -- one thing, I'll take you back just to January -- or the first quarter back in 2017. We had a large solar project, our Blythe solar project, that was originally on CITCs. For various reasons, we converted that over to ITCs for tax reasons. That was captured all in the first quarter. Typically, we would spread the ITCs on a project over a year. But because that project's already been placed into operation, it all showed up in the first quarter. But certainly in '17, nothing unusual. Our ITC and PTC makeup was very similar to what you've seen for a number of years from Energy Resources. But that ITC recognition event in the first quarter of 2017 just set up a bad comparison for new investment activity. One other thing I should say, Greg, is the whole year is fine now. I mean, when you look at the new investment activity for the year, it's fine. 
Greg Gordon: Okay, I appreciate that. Second question, one of the things you guys have not done is just have your focus expand to looking at or bidding on, at least you haven't publicly disclosed, any bids on offshore wind. Nor have you expanded the breadth of your focus geographically outside of North America. Can you comment as to why there isn't an opportunity on a risk-adjusted basis, either on offshore wind or outside North America that is attractive to you? 
John Ketchum: Yes, I'm going to turn that question over to Jim. 
James Robo: So Greg, just on offshore winds, we looked very hard at offshore winds 15 years ago and worked on a project off of Long Island, got very close on it. I personally spent, when I was running NextEra Energy Resources at the time, personally spent a lot of time on the development on that project. And fundamentally, development time lines are 5 to 10 years. Permitting is uncertain. It is a moon shot in terms of building, in terms of finding people who actually know what they're doing from a construction standpoint. It's terrible energy policy, and then it's really expensive. I mean, even in New England, for example, in the last RFP, Massachusetts turned down several projects that we bid at $0.05 for -- in solar. And you can do -- let me tell you, offshore wind RFP in Massachusetts is not going to come in at $0.05. It is just -- it's bad energy policy, and it's bad business. And so we don't tend to do either of those things. And so that's why we're not going to be doing offshore wind. In terms of international, this industry has, honestly, a pretty lousy track record in international. And we have plenty of things to keep us busy here in North America. And we're going to continue to be focused in primarily in U.S. going forward, and we'll be able to continue to grow well just with that focus. I think our investors are not really too excited about us doing anything outside of the U.S. 
Operator: Next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. 
Michael Lapides: Just on FPL, can you rehash a little bit? I may have lost you during the prepared remarks. Are you effectively kind of raising your earnings expectations for FP&L and maybe the earnings growth rate off of 2017 actuals? 
John Ketchum: Well, let's back up just a minute. So on FPL, because we had taken all the surplus against Irma, we expected depreciation expense to be higher, right, in the first quarter and the second quarter as well. But we are replenishing our surplus balance at the same time through continued tax savings. Now we were able to offset that higher depreciation expense at FPL through higher base revenues and reduced O&M expenses in the first quarter. And so what that has allowed us to do is probably move up the timing of when we could perhaps achieve an 11.6% ROE on that business. We had originally communicated in last call, that may not be until third quarter. It looks more likely it could be late in the second quarter or early in the third quarter. So things at FPL continue to progress a bit better than expected because of the improvements that we've seen in weather and in O&M. 
Michael Lapides: And so should we assume kind of in your going-forward guidance, meaning not just 2018, beyond, that you stay in that 11.5%, 11.6% range in terms of earned ROEs? And then, should we also assume that kind of, because there's no bonus depreciation, whatever your old rate base growth guidance pretax reform is, now it's actually a higher number? 
John Ketchum: Yes. So a couple of things there. I mean, first of all, the 11.6% is included in our financial expectations for 2018, the $7.70. Nothing's changed with regard to the $7.70 target or with the financial expectations that we have communicated, growing 6% to 8%. Disappointed not to be at the higher end off that -- off of that $7.70 target. All that's really happened with -- you saw a little bit of an increase in the regulatory capital employed growth for the first quarter at the 12.9%, and we expect regulatory capital employed growth to be around 9% between 2017 and 2021. That's really a factor of just backing deferred -- accumulated deferred taxes out of our rate base calculation. And the reason that we've done that is deferred tax liabilities, which are 0 cost to equity, are actually going to decrease over time. Because as you recall, with tax reform, FPL, and all rate-regulated utilities, are allowed to take full interest deductibility without being subject to the German thin cap rule of 30% of EBITDA and then 30% of EBIT after 5 years. But in exchange for that, regulated utilities can no longer take immediate expensing. Because FPL can no longer take immediate expensing, its book cash difference on taxes decreases, and so its deferred tax liability goes down, which means it's 0 cost to equity comes down. So we just went ahead and pulled the accumulated deferred tax impact line out of our rate base since its 0 cost to equity. That resulted in a slight uptick in the regulatory capital employed growth that you can expect for FPL at the 12.9%. We have a walk on that in the Appendix. 
Operator: Next question comes from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. 
Jonathan Arnold: Could I just ask on the market in the -- I know you don't identify individual counterparties. But could you give us a sense of the breakdown in the new origination by customer type at all, whether utilities, munis, corporates, just some flavor there? 
Armando Pimentel: It's probably pretty close to 1/3, 1/3, 1/3. I mean it's not going to be exactly there. But I mean we had a -- we're being -- we're having more success in the C&I sector, I'd say, over the last 6 to 8 months then we had in the past. We talked about that before, that while that was never going to be a really big sector for us, we needed to bring our market share up a little bit, and we've done that. We're still very competitive on what I would call the IOUs. That's a market that I think we do -- not I think, we do the best in, in terms of market share compared to the other markets. But we're also seeing munis and co-ops that are buying. And interestingly, in the comment I made before, it's the muni, co-op and large IOUs that are really reaching out further in the curve than the C&I sector, right? When you're pricing the C&I sector, you're really pricing projects for this year or next year primarily. And when you're pricing projects for the larger companies, we're now seeing -- we're pricing projects in 2022. So it's -- I'm happy with all of the sectors and how we're doing. And I'm really happy that we're seeing a lot of activity beyond 2020. 
Jonathan Arnold: Of the 1,000 megawatts out of this quarter, is it roughly an equal breakdown? 
Armando Pimentel: It's definitely not equal, but I'd say it's probably 1/3, 1/3, 1/3, some -- it's not going to be 90 and 10. 
Jonathan Arnold: Yes. So that's what I was looking for, Armando. And then, just want to -- I wanted to thank you for putting the portfolio slide back in on the projected numbers. I'm just curious. I noticed on the contracted renewables line for new investment, you're now mentioning in the footnote that, that includes net proceeds from selling development projects. So was curious how much of the number is that -- is it a material amount? And is that just things you already you announced? Or are you anticipating further activity on that front? 
John Ketchum: Yes. Jonathan, if you remember, I think it was last year, we announced the -- a transaction with a larger customer, which I think most of you folks know who that is. It was around 1,500 megawatts. And out of that 1,500 megawatts, 500 of it was going to be PPAs. And then about 1,000 megawatts of it was going to be, what I would call, build-own-transfer projects. Some of them were early-stage development rights projects, where we were going to flip the project prior to even ordering the turbines or doing any of the construction that was going to be done by the buyer. And then also some build, own, transfer. We'd actually build the project and then flip it. We see that business in certain circumstances as a very good business for us and a continuing business for us. Because what it could do is it can allow us to get more long-term contracted PPAs. But if you have an opportunity to sell development rights on a project -- remember, we have a very large land bank, which we talked about in the past, close to 20 gigawatts, where we go out, we heat map the entire country, we secure land rights. We have interconnection of key positions. And we can take those pieces of property, which are actually good development sites, and sell them and earn roughly 20% of the NPV that we could earn on, projects that we built completely and that we own for its remaining useful life. And on the build, own, transfer, you can build the project and not have to take any of the operational risk and sell it for an NPV at roughly 40% to 45% of what we could achieve if we held the asset through end of life. So those are opportunities, typically with larger investor-owned utilities, that we will continue to evaluate and look at because they are good return, good NPV-producing opportunities for the overall business. But let's not forget, the size of the renewable pie is as big as it's ever been. And it's as big as it's ever been because coal and nuclear are very expensive. We have a significant cost advantage over both coal and nuclear. And also, an efficiency and cost advantage over lower-efficient oil-fire generation and gas-fire generation projects. And so as we go forward, the bulk of our activity is always going to be signing PPAs and holding the asset through life. But there can be some opportunities also around the build-own-transfer side, which will be very attractive as well. We won't ignore those opportunities as they come forward. 
Jonathan Arnold: John, I get why you're doing it, but I was curious if there's -- if you can calibrate how much of the 200 to 400 relates to that kind of thing for 2018. And whether that's the deal that you signed last year or a new one? 
John Ketchum: Yes. The reason I was giving the context, Jonathan, is that it's going to move around, right? I mean because it's something that we will look at on an opportunistic basis, sometimes it'll be like what we had announced on a larger transaction last year where we were able to do the build, own, transfer in exchange for getting over 500 megawatts of long-term contracts out of that deal. But when you look at our addressable market, it's -- I've always said, it's munis, co-ops, small- to medium-sized investor-owned utilities and larger investor-owned utilities that look to do a little bit of rate basing. This provides a nice build-own-transfer opportunity for us as well, and then everything that we see on the C&I space. So terrific growth opportunities we continue to see on the long-term contracted side of the business. But sometimes, we are going to be opportunistic as part of our continuing business operation looking at build, own, transfers. But it's going to -- I can't give you a flat number of, oh, expect this amount in any one year. It's just going to change over time. 
Jonathan Arnold: Was the deal you referenced from last year, was that booked last year? Or was that sort of booked when the regulatory approval comes over this year perhaps? 
John Ketchum: This year. 
Jonathan Arnold: So that's part of this year's number, but you're not going to -- you can't give us a sense of how much. 
John Ketchum: Yes, it's -- we'll make further announcements of it going forward. But it's not going to be a material part of our earnings for the year. 
James Robo: The other thing, Jonathan, is we've sold projects every year for the last 15 years. It's not going to be any bigger or less than it's ever been in the last 15 years as part of NextEra Energy Resources' net income. It's going to move around, as John said, but it's not a big deal. It's us making sure that we capitalize on the market. And its terrific return on invested capital, and it's really good for shareholders. 
Jonathan Arnold: Perfect. So it's a modest thing and not changing that much. 
Operator: This will conclude the question-and-answer session as well as today's conference. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2017 Q4  (2018-01-26 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Matthew Roskot. Please go ahead, sir.
Matthew Roskot: Thank you, April. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2017 combined earnings conference call for NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. With me this morning are Jim Robo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; John Ketchum, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; Armando Pimentel, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources; and Mark Hickson, Executive Vice President of NextEra Energy, all of whom are also officers of NextEra Energy Partners; as well as Eric Silagy, President and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light Company. Jim will provide some opening remarks, and we will then turn the call over to John for a review of our fourth quarter and full year results. Our executive team will then be available to answer your questions. We will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release, in the comments made during this conference call, in the risk factors section of the accompanying presentation, on our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found on our websites, nexteraenergy.com and nexteraenergypartners.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. Today's presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of historical non-GAAP measures to the closest GAAP financial measure. With that, I will turn the call over to Jim.
James L. Robo: Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. As John will describe in more detail later in the call, 2017 was a terrific year for both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. Moreover, 2017 was a year in which we successfully positioned both businesses for strong growth well into the next decade. For NextEra Energy Partners, we started 2017 by structurally modifying the IDR fee, which allowed NEP to extend its distribution growth expectations through at least 2022, avoid the need to sell common equity until 2020 at the earliest, other than modest sales under the ATM program, and increase levered returns for unit holders to the low double digits on future acquisitions. This change, combined with other steps we took to improve NEP's investor value proposition over the past year, including governance enhancements, stand-alone credit ratings in the mid to high BB category, and NEP's utilization of additional sources of low cost financing, helped separate NEP from its peers. We were able to grow the NEP LP distribution by 15% year-over-year and deliver a total unit holder return of over 75%. NEP outperformed other yieldcos by more than 55% on average, and its total shareholder return was almost 90% higher than the Alerian MLP Index. With the flexibility to grow in three ways -- acquiring assets from Energy Resources, organically, or acquiring assets from other third parties -- NEP has clear visibility to support its growth going forward. As we've said before, Energy Resources portfolio, as of the end of 2016, provides one potential path to support NEP's 12-15% growth per year through 2022. And, with one of the lowest costs of capital among all yieldcos and MLPs, NEP has the currency to be competitive in acquiring long-term contracted assets from other third parties going forward. With tax reform and a record renewable origination year by Energy Resources, and what promises to be one of the best renewables development environments in our history over the next several years, we look forward to further improving NEP's already best in class distribution growth visibility. I continue to believe that, when NEP's growth potential is combined with its substantial financing flexibility, and the strength of its underlying portfolio, with an 18-year average contract life and strong counterparty credit profile, NEP offers unit holders an investor value proposition that is second to none. For these reasons, NEP is as well positioned as its ever been, and I look forward to strong performance in 2018 and beyond. Turning now to NextEra Energy, 2017 was an outstanding year of execution across the board. Financially, we were able to grow 2017 adjusted EPS by 8.2% and extend our long-term track record of delivering results for shareholders. Dating back to 2005, we've delivered compounded annual growth and adjusted EPS of over 8%, which is the highest among all top-ten US power companies who have achieved, on average, compounded annual growth of 2.9% over the same period. In 2017, we delivered a total shareholder return of over 34%, outperforming the S&P 500 by roughly 15% and the S&P Utilities Index by more than 25%. Over the last ten years, we've outperformed 79% of the S&P 500 (sic) Utilities Index and 63% of the S&P 500. We were once again honored to be named, for the 11th time in 12 years, number one in the electric and gas utilities industry on Fortune's 2018 list of World's Most Admired Companies. The strength of our 2017 execution has set the foundation for several announcements that I'm going to make on this morning's call. First, as we announced last week, tax reform provides an unprecedented opportunity to benefit FPL customers. Rather than seek recovery from customers of the approximately $1.3 billion in Hurricane Irma storm restoration costs, FPL plans to recover these costs through federal tax savings generated during its current settlement agreement. During the fourth quarter, FPL expense, the approximately $1.3 billion was recorded as a regulatory asset related to Irma cost recovery, and utilize the available reserve amortization to offset nearly all of this expense, ending the year with a zero reserve amortization balance. FPL expects to partially restore the reserve amortization utilized in the fourth quarter through tax savings, and to end 2020 with a sufficient amount of surplus to potentially avoid a base rate increase for up to two additional years, in 2021 and 2022. As a reminder, FPL is currently allowed to earn within a permitted ROE band of 9.6-11.6%. The settlement agreement also allows FPL to access and utilize the accumulated reserve amortization available at the end of 2020 by deferring the initiation of a new base rate case. Based on what we see at this time, and assuming normal weather and operating conditions, our goal is for FPL to continue operating under its current base rate settlement agreement for up to two additional years. The flexibility afforded under the settlement agreement provides FPL with the ability to return tax savings to customers in the fastest way possible. By foregoing the surcharge, FPL customers are expected to save approximately $250.00 on average through 2020, with a typical residential bill nearly 30% below the national average following a $3.35 per month decrease that will take effect March 1st, with the completion of cost recovery for Hurricane Matthew. Moreover, by potentially operating under the settlement agreement for up to two additional years, customers save by avoiding a base rate increase in 2021 and 2022. Second, I'm pleased to announce that we're increasing our financial expectations to take into account the favorable impact of tax reform at Energy Resources. The reduction in the corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% at Energy Resources is significantly accretive to earnings. Due primarily to this favorable impact, tax reform is expected to increase NextEra Energy's adjusted EPS by roughly $0.45 in 2018. For 2018, our goal is to achieve our new $7.70 per share midpoint, which assumes we grow our 2017 adjusted EPS of $6.70 per share by 8% and add approximately $0.45 for the benefit of tax reform. Third, with the certainty provided by the new tax reform legislation, and the anticipated continued strength of the investment opportunities at both FPL and Energy Resources, I'm also pleased to announce that we're extending NextEra Energy's financial expectations by one year, from 2020 to 2021. With this announcement, we now expect to be able to sustain the 6-8% per year growth in adjusted EPS off our revised 2018 midpoint of $7.70 per share through 2021, subject to our usual caveats. Details of our new financial expectations are included in the accompanying slide. Tax reform is generally expected to result in lower operating cash flows for NextEra Energy as FPL uses tax savings to recover the Irma storm surcharges. Despite this, everything we see now suggests that our operating cash flow will continue to grow in line with our adjusted EPS growth range from 2018-2021. Overall, the tax reform outcome is positive and will immediately benefit FPL customers while being accretive to NextEra Energy shareholders. Fourth, we're advancing our renewable product offerings as we prepare for the next phase of renewable development. As a result, our prospects for new renewables growth has never been stronger. As expected, congress did not make any retroactive changes to the PTC or ITC, which were each extended under a five-year phasedown at the end of 2015. With incentives, wind is the cheapest form of energy at 1.2-1.8 cents per kilowatt hour at high wind sites while solar continues to be priced at a discount to other forms of generation at 2.5-3.5 cents per kilowatt hour. Taken together, we continue to be in the best renewables environment in our history as evidenced by our 2017 results. The ongoing cost declines in renewables are leading to increased economic demand from customers. Wind turbine technology continues to improve through a combination of taller towers and wider rotor diameters. Today, we're installing 127-meter rotor diameter turbines. By 2021, we expect manufacturers to be selling approximately 150-meter rotor diameter turbines in the US market, further increasing net capacity factors and helping reduce installed wind costs on a $1.00 per kilowatt basis. Over the past year, we've seen an approximate 30% reduction in turbine costs. Through the end of the decade, we expect another 10% decline per year on average. As a result, we continue to expect that, without incentives early in the next decade, wind is going to be a 2.0-2.5 cent per kilowatt hour product. For solar, we continue to see rapid price declines and efficiency improvements and we're well positioned to mitigate any impacts of the recently announced tariffs from the ITC 201 proceeding. As we previously discussed, before any tariffs were put in place, we purchased modules for our 2017 and 2018 build. We recently completed an additional order that covers our module needs for 2019 and a significant portion of our 2020 build. Ultimately, we expect that by 2020, as the tariff steps down, the market will have adjusted to these new dynamics. By early in the next decade, as further cost declines are realized and module efficiencies continue to improve, we expect that without incentives, solar will be a 3.0-4.0 cent per kilowatt hour product, below the variable cost required to operate an existing coal or nuclear generating facility of 3.5-5.0 cents per kilowatt hour. As the world's current leader in wind, solar, and storage development, we are uniquely positioned for the next phase renewables deployment that pairs low cost wind and solar energy with a low cost battery storage solution to provide a product that can be dispatched with enough certainty to meet customer needs for a firm generation resource. We believe no other company has our expertise in all three products -- wind, solar, and battery storage -- to leverage the combined technologies at the low cost we can achieve. In fact, we recently submitted a bid at a very competitive price for a combined wind, solar, and battery storage product, that is able to provide an around the clock, nearly firm, shaped product specifically designed to meet the customers' needs. By leveraging Energy Resources' competitive advantages, including our development skills, purchasing power, best in class construction expertise, resource assessment capabilities, strong access to and cost of capital advantages, and the ability to combine wind, solar, and battery storage solutions together, we remain well positioned to capture a meaningful and growing share of the renewables market going forward. Finally, in addition to increasing and extending our financial expectations, and having what I believe to be the best opportunity set in our industry, we continue to maintain one of the strongest balance sheets in our sector. Through the sale of noncore assets over the last two years, including fibernet and our Forney, Lamar, and Marcus Hook gas generation assets, we've recycled almost $4 billion of capital while advancing our strategy to become more long-term contracted and rate regulated. Based on the strength of our balance sheet and enhanced business risk profile, S&P and Moody's recently announced favorable adjustments to our credit metric thresholds. While S&P has already reduced our FFO to debt rating trigger to 23% from 26%, yesterday Moody's announced its plan to reduce NextEra Energy's CFO per working capital to debt rating threshold from 20% to 18% if the regulated contribution to our business mix continues to improve to approximately 70% over time. Based on this level of regulated contribution, we would also expect a further reduction to our FFO to debt rating trigger from S&P. At our current thresholds of 23% and 20%, at S&P and Moddy's respectively, we currently expect to have $5-7 billion of excess balance sheet capacity that can be utilized through 2021 to either buyback shares or opportunistically execute of profitable incremental capital investment or profitable acquisition opportunities, if it makes sense to do so. Our excess balance sheet capacity serves as a cushion as it's utilization is not currently assumed in our financial expectations. Today's announcements set the foundation for growth over the next four years. While there certainly will be challenges what we'll have to manage, due to the overall strength and diversity of our opportunity set, I will be disappointed if we're not able to continue to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our 6-8% compound annual growth rate range, while at the same time maintaining our strong credit ratings. I remain as enthusiastic as ever about our future prospects, and today's announcements for NextEra Energy are a reflection of that enthusiasm. I'll now turn the call over to John to provide the detailed results.
John Ketchum: Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy delivered solid performance in the fourth quarter, capping off an outstanding year overall. We achieved full year adjusted earnings per share of $6.70, up 8.2% from 2016, while continuing to make excellent progress on our major growth initiatives. FPO grew regulatory capital employed approximately 10.3% year-over-year as we continue to invest in the new and modernized generation as well as a stronger and smarter grid to further improve the already outstanding efficiency and reliability of our system. All of our major capital initiatives, including one of the largest solar expansions ever in the eastern US, remain on track. In 2017, FPL continued executing on its outstanding customer value proposition, delivering its best ever service relatability performance while maintaining a typical customer bill that is more than 25% below the national average and the lowest among the top ten investor owned utilities by market cap. As Jim mentioned earlier, 2017 was the best period for new wind and solar origination in our history. The Energy Resources team added more than 2,700 megawatts of new renewables projects to our backlog, including the largest combined solar and storage facility in the United States announced to date, and roughly 700 megawatts of additional wind repowering to our backlog. Over the course of the year, we commissioned roughly 2,150 megawatts of wind and solar projects in the US, including the first approximately 1,600 megawatts of our repowering program. All in all, 2017 was a terrific year of execution at FPL and Energy Resources. Now, let's look at the detailed results, beginning with FPL. For the fourth quarter of 2017, FPL reported GAAP net income of $344 million, or $0.73 per share. FPL's adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter, which excludes a tax reform related item that I will discuss in a moment, were $394 million, or $0.84 per share, an increase of $23 million and $0.05 per share respectively year-over-year. For the full year 2017, FPL reported GAAP earnings of $1.88 billion, or $3.98 per share. Adjusted earnings were at $1.93 billion, or $4.09 per share. Before moving on, let me take a moment to discuss the specific tax reform impacts to FPL. For the fourth quarter, FPL is excluding from adjusted earnings the $50 million after tax net impact that results primarily from the short fall of available reserve amortization to offset the Irma cost recovery expense. This tax reform related item reduced our reported ROE for regulatory purposes to approximately 11.1% for the 12 months ended December 2017. For the full year 2018, we expect tax savings to begin restoring our reserve amortization balance and, coupled with our weather normalized sales forecast and current CapEx and O&M expectations, we expect to target a regulatory ROE of 11.6%. Based upon our historic pattern of underlying revenues and expenses, we do not expect that the tax savings will fully offset our typical reserve amortization requirements for the first half of 2018, causing FPL to initially earn below our 11.6% target regulatory ROE. We expect FPL to earn a regulatory ROE toward the middle of the range of roughly 10.4-10.8% in the first quarter, and roughly 10.7-11.1% in the second quarter before returning to more normal levels in the third and fourth quarter, all on a trailing 12-mmonth basis and subject to our normal caveats. While this will result in some lumpiness in our quarterly expectations, we do not expect it to impact our full-year results. During the fourth quarter, FPL was required to revalue its deferred income tax liabilities to the new 21% corporate income tax rate. The majority of the reduction in income tax liability, totaling approximately $4.5 billion has been reclassified to a regulatory liability that we expect will be amortized over the underlying assets remaining useful lives. Regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 10.3% for 2017 and was the principle driver of FPL's adjusted EPS growth of 10.2% for the full year. FPL built upon key successes from 2016, again being recognized as the most reliable electric utility in the southeast. At the same time, FPL's typical customer bill has remained well below both state and national averages. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter, bringing its full year capital investments to a total of roughly $5.3 billion. Each of our ongoing capital deployment initiatives continues to progress well. We were pleased to completed construction of the first four 74.5 megawatt solar energy centers governed by the solar based rate adjustment, or SoBRA, mechanism of the rate case settlement agreement, on schedule and under budget. An additional four solar site totaling nearly 300 megawatts are currently on track to being providing cost effective energy to FPL customers later this quarter. We also continue to advance the development of the additional 1,600 megawatts of solar projects that are planned for beyond 2018 and have secured potential sites that could support more than five gigawatts for FPL's ongoing solar expansion. This month, we completed the early retirement of the St. John's River Power Park, an approximately 1,300 megawatt coal fire plant co owned with JEA. Construction on the approximately 1,750-megawatt Okeechobee Clean Energy Center remains on schedule and on budget. Additionally, progress on the Dania Beach Clean Energy Center continues to advance through the regulatory approval process. Continued smart investments such as these will allow FPL to deliver on its outstanding customer value proposition of low bills, higher liability, and superior customer service, and are expected to support a compound annual growth rate in regulatory capital employed of approximately 8% from the start of the settlement agreement in January 2017 through at least December 2021. The economy in Florida remains healthy. The current unemployment rate of 3.7% remains below the national average and near the lowest levels in a decade. Florida's consumer confidence level remains near 10-year highs. The real estate sector also continues to show strength with new building permits remaining at healthy levels and the Case-Shiller Index for South Florida home prices up 4.4% from the prior year. FPL's fourth quarter retail sales increased 0.5% from the prior year comparable period. We estimate that weather related usage per customer contributed approximately 1.2% to this amount. On a weather normalized basis, fourth quarter sales declined 0.7% as ongoing customer growth was more than offset by a decline in weather normalized usage per customer. For 2017, we estimate that FPL's retail sales benefited from a positive year-over-year impact of 1.7% from weather, which is partially offset by a decline of 0.9% as a result of the net effects of Hurricanes Matthew and Irma. After accounting for these factors and the 2016 leap year impact, FPL's 2017 retail sales on a weather normalized basis declined by 1.6%, which was primarily driven by a reduction in underlying usage per customer, partially offset by customer growth. While the recent trend in underlying usage is below our long-term expectations, we have not yet drawn any firm conclusions. We will continue to closely monitor and analyze underlying usage and will update you on future calls. Modest changes in usage per customer are not likely to have a material effect on earnings while we operate under the current settlement agreement, as we will adjust the level of reserve amortization utilization to offset any effect which is expected to allow FPL to maintain its target regulatory ROE. Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported full year 2017 GAAP earnings of $2.96 billion, or $6.27 per share. Adjusted earnings were $1.23 billion, or $2.61 per share, reflecting roughly 12% year-over-year growth. For the fourth quarter, Energy Resources reported GAAP earnings of $1.894 billion, or $4.00 per share, and adjusted earnings of $230 million, or $0.49 per share. This quarter's adjusted results exclude two items, a gain related to revaluing deferred income tax liabilities that I will discuss in a moment, and a charge associated with our Duane Arnold Energy Center. For Duane Arnold, in the latter part of 2017, we concluded that it is unlikely that the facility's primary customer will extend the current contract after it expires in 2025. Without a contract extension, we will likely close the facility at the end of 2025, despite being licensed to operate until 2034. As a result, during the fourth quarter, Duane Arnold's book value and asset retirement obligation were reviewed and an after tax impairment of $258 million was recorded that reflects our belief it is unlikely the project will operate after 2025. That being said, we will continue to pursue a contract extension that would enable Duane Arnold to continue operations. Duane Arnold's contribution to Energy Resource's net income has been, and is expected to be, negligible over the next several years. As a result of tax reform, Energy Resources was required to revalue its deferred income tax liability to the new 21% corporate income tax rate. This $1.925 billion reduction in income tax liability provided an income tax benefit during the fourth quarter, which has been excluded from adjusted earnings. Based upon our strong banking relationships and our position as the number one renewables developer, we remain confident that our access to equity will remain robust. As an example, following the signing of the tax reform legislation, we were able to close our four remaining 2017 tax equity financing, totaling more than $1 billion in proceeds at economics substantially similar to what was expected before tax reform. Energy Resources' contribution to adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter increased by $0.08 versus the prior year comparable period. This primarily reflects contributions from new investments and increased contributions from our existing generation assets as a result of repowering, partially offset by lower contributions from our gas infrastructure business, due to the absence of a Texas pipeline earn out adjustment that was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016. Energy Resources' full year adjusted earnings per share contribution increased $0.28, or approximately 12% year-over-year. Growth was driven by continued new additions to our renewables portfolio, including the roughly 2,500 megawatts of new wind and solar projects that we can commissioned in 2016, which are included in new investments during the first 12 months of their operation. In total, new renewables investments added $0.67 per share. Contributions from new natural gas pipeline investments added $0.10 per share. Partially offsetting new investment growth was a decline of $0.11 per share, and contributions from our existing generation assets, the majority of which is attributable to sales of Lamar, Forney, and Marcus Hook natural gas fire generating assets in 2016. Contributions from our gas infrastructure business declined by $0.19 per share, $0.16 of which is attributable to the absence of the earn out adjustment that was recognized for the Texas pipelines in 2016. All of the other effects had a negative impact of $0.19 per share, mostly driven by a year-over-year increase in interest expense. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide. In 2017, Energy Resources advanced its position as the leading developer and operator of wind, solar, and battery storage projects. Since the last call, we have signed contracts for 736 megawatts of new renewables projects, including 512 megawatts of wind and 224 megawatts of solar. With today's announced contracts, our 2017 and 2018 wind backlog is now nearly 2,000 megawatts. With visibility to several hundred megawatts of additional projects for 2018, we continue to believe that we can achieve the range of expectations that we have previously provided for 2017 and 2018. For 2019 and 2020, we are already just below the range of expectations that we have provided for solar. And, for US wind, our current backlog is already almost half of the low end of our expected range. Additionally, our total current backlog of almost 7,000 megawatts, including repowering for 2017-2020, is the largest for a four-year period in Energy Resource's history. The accompanying slide provides additional detail on where our renewables development program now stands. Beyond renewables, 2017 was an excellent year for Energy Resources' natural gas pipeline activities. During the year, both the Sable Trail transmission and Florida Southeast connection natural gas pipeline projects successfully achieved commercial operation on budget and on schedule. The Mountain Valley pipeline also made excellent progress over the year, receiving its first limited notice to proceed from FERC earlier this week. We remain on track to achieve a year-end 2018 commercial operations date. Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy for the fourth quarter of 2017, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $2.155 billion, or $4.55 per share. NextEra Energy's 2017 fourth quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $590 million, or $1.25 per share respectively. For the full year 2017, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $5.378 billion, or $11.28 per share. Adjusted earnings were $3.165 billion, or $6.70 per share. NextEra Energy's operating cash flow, adjusted for the impacts of certain FPL clause recoveries, storm costs and recovers, and the Indiantown acquisition, increased by almost 15% year-over-year. During the fourth quarter, we were able to capitalize on the ongoing favorable market conditions and completed all of the refinancing initiatives we were considering as of the third quarter call. These combined financings, which have roughly $165 million of after tax MPV savings on a cash basis, results in a net income reduction of approximately $33 million when they closed in the fourth quarter. For the corporate and other segment, adjusted earnings for the full year decreased $0.15 per share compared to 2016, primarily reflecting the impact of the refinancing costs. Turning now to our financial expectations for NextEra Energy, as Jim discussed, we are increasing the range of our adjusted EPS expectations and extending our long-term growth outlook. We now expect NextEra Energy's adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate to be in the range of 6-8% through 2021 off a revised base of the midpoint of our new 2018 range, or $7.70 per share. Additional details of our revised expectations are shown in the accompanying slide. For 2018, while we target the new $7.70 midpoint of our range, we expect that the majority of the growth will come in the second half of the year. As I mentioned earlier, in the first half of the year, FPL's expected to earn below its regulatory ROE of 11.6% as we do not expect the tax savings will immediately offset our typical reserve amortization requirements. This will present a headwind to adjusted EPS growth during the first quarter, with stronger growth expected for the balance of the year as the regulatory ROE on a trailing 12-month basis increases toward our target 11.6% level by the second half of the year. During the period of our financial expectations, we expect the interest on all NextEra Energy's debt to continue to be fully tax deductible at the new 21% federal corporate income tax rate despite the limit on interest deductibility in the tax reform legislation. As a reminder, due to the NEP governance changes that we implemented in 2017, NextEra Energy is required to deconsolidate NEP from its financial statements, beginning January 1, 2018. These changes will be reflected in our first quarter financial results. We continue to expect to grow our dividends per share 12-14% per year through at least 2018, off a 2015 base of dividends per share of $3.08. We expect the board of NextEra Energy to determine the dividend policy for beyond 2018 at our next regularly scheduled board meeting in February, and we will make an announcement about the outcome of their decision at that time. As always, our expectations are subject to the usual caveats, including but not limited to normal weather and operating conditions. Let me now turn to NEP. Yesterday, the NEP board declared a quarterly distribution of 40.5 cents per common unit, or $1.62 per common unit on an annualized basis, up 15% from the comparable quarterly distribution a year earlier, and at the top end of the range we discussed going into 2017. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA and CAFD increased approximately 18% and 12% year-over-year respectively. For the full year 2017, adjusted EBITDA increased 16% while CAFD was up 11% from 2016. In regards to the impacts of tax reform for NextEra Energy Partners, NEP recorded a $101 million charge related to revaluing its deferred income taxes to the new 21% corporate income tax rate in the fourth quarter. The duration of NEP's income tax shield, which we had previously said is greater than 15 years, will remain better than 15 years following tax reform. Additionally, the expectation that NEP runs a negative earnings and profits, or E&P, balance for at least the next eight years also remains unchanged. With no adverse impacts to NEP's tax shields or the ongoing strength of the renewables development environment, NEP remains well positioned to continue delivering on its unit holder value proposition. NEP's fourth quarter 2017 adjusted EBITDA of approximately $199 million increased $31 million from a year earlier. Fourth quarter CAFD was approximately $76 million, and increase of $8 million year-over-year, which was drive primarily by NEP's strong portfolio growth with a relatively modest offset from higher fees. Wind resource returned to normal after a week third quarter, as overall wind resource was 102% of the long-term average during the fourth quarter. The appendix of today's presentation includes a slide with additional details regarding 2017 wind resource for the NEP portfolio. For full-year 2017, adjusted EBITDA and CAFD were $743 million and $246 million, up 16% and 11% respectively, driven primarily by growth of the underlying portfolio. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide. The NEP portfolio, as of year end 2017, supports adjusted EBITDA and CAFD run rates in line with the expectations we have shared previously for December 31, 2017. Since the federal income tax rate declined from 35% to 21%, the resulting pre-tax value of NEP's tax credits, which are calculated by dividing one minus tax rate changes as well. While tax reform impacts the calculation of NEP's adjusted EBITDA, it has no effect on cash available for distribution. Our previous December 31, 2017 run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA of $875-975 million are now at $830-930 million as a result of this change. The December 31, 2017 run rate range for CAFD of $310-340 million remains unchanged. Our previously announced December 31, 2018 run rate expectations reflecting calendar year 2019 expectations for the forecasted portfolio year end 2018 for adjusted EBITDA of $1.05-1.2 billion are now $1-1.15 billion as a result of tax reform. The December 31, 2018 run rate range for CAFD of $360-400 million is unchanged. As a reminder, our expectations are subject to our normal caveats, and our net of anticipated IDR fees as we treat these an ongoing operating expense. From an updated base of our fourth quarter 2017 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $1.62, we continue to see 12-15% per year growth in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2022. We expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2018 distribution, that is payable in February 2019, to be in the range of $1.81-1.86 per common unit. Tax reform has highlighted several optimization opportunities within NEP's international portfolio, which we continue to evaluate. Once such opportunity that we are exploring is the potential sale of the Canadian portfolio, which could enable the partnership to recycle capital back into US assets, which benefit from a longer federal income tax shield, allowing NEP to retain more CAFD in the future for every dollar invested. We would only execute on such a transaction if it were accretive to NEP's long-term growth runway to do so, potentially positioning the partnership to extend its financial expectations and need for common equity. If we decide to move forward, we will update you on the progress of our efforts over the coming months. With the IDR restructuring, governance enhancements, financing flexibility, competitive cost of capital, and visible prospects for future growth in place, we are pleased with NEP's execution during 2017. Heading into 2018 and beyond, NEP is as well positioned as it's ever been to deliver its long-term financial expectations and best in class investor value proposition. ...
Operator: [Operator instructions] We'll take our first question from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Stephen Calder Byrd: Good morning. Congratulations on good results and a great outlook. I wanted to hit first on the last thing John talked about on NextEra Energy Partners in terms of the potential for sell of the Canadian portfolio. I didn't quite follow the potential benefit of that and how to think about that. What would the rationale be in terms of tax reform?
John Ketchum: We are looking, as a result of tax reform, at some optimization opportunities around our international portfolio. There is a difference between the federal income tax shield in the US and in Canada after the results of tax reform have come through. This has pinpointed a potential capital recycling opportunity, where we may be able to sell the assets in the Canadian portfolio and then use those proceeds to reinvest either in third party M&A opportunities or acquisitions from energy resources or to support our organic growth program. By reinvesting those proceeds in the US, it has the effect of actually creating more CAFD for every dollar invested. Because of that, it puts us in a position where we could extend our runway, our financial expectations, and extend the need for common equity. So, it's kind of a very interesting opportunity that we continue to evaluate here internally.
Stephen Calder Byrd: Understood. That makes a lot of sense. At the beginning, you mentioned some of the changes in rating agencies in terms of targeted ratios. I just want to make sure I understood that properly. Given the most recent change from Moody's that you mentioned, moving from 20% to 18% if there was a mix of regulated assets in the 70% range, am I to understand that if you had that kind of business mix that would result in additional leverage capacity over the $5-7 billion? Did I get that right?
John Ketchum: Yeah, so let's walk through it. Right now, here's the state of play. We are at 23% FFO to debt with S&P. We're currently at 20% CFO to debt with Moody's. Moody's has said that we have an opportunity to move down from 20% to 18% if we're able to further improve our regulated business mix up to 70%. S&P though is still the gating metric, so S&P -- we feel like, if we can improve our regulated mix to right around the same range that Moody's is targeting, that would also result in a reduction to the S&P credit threshold. So, yes, that would create additional balance sheet capacity. But, right now, the $5-7 billion of balance sheet capacity that we described is tethered to where we stand today, which is 23% at S&P and 20% at Moody's, with the opportunity to further improve upon that $5-7 billion of excess balance sheet capacity if we're able to make a slight improvement in our regulated business mix for both agencies.
Stephen Calder Byrd: That's very clear. And then, lastly, on the utility business. In terms of tax reform, I just wanted to check whether that has any impacts on your net rate base growth? I was wondering whether it might increase your rate base growth or if you think your overall rate base position over time is similar to where it's been in the past, pre tax reform.
John Ketchum: No, it does impact our rate base. One of the main impacts of tax reform is for rate regulated utilities. Customers and shareholders benefit because we're able to preserve in the final outcome of tax reform the ability to fully deduct interest at the utility level. But, that was made as a compromise in exchange for no longer being able to take immediate expensing at the utility. So, if you can't take immediately expensing at the utility as the impact of lowering our deferred tax liability, which is actually zero cost equity in our capital structure -- so, if that goes down, it's just more equity that we're able to put into the business, which has an effect of increasing the rate base growth over time.
Stephen Calder Byrd: Understood. I'll follow offline in terms of going through the rate base calcs. Thanks so much.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Steve Fleishman: Hi. Good morning. A couple of questions. On the excess capital, the $5-7 billion, to clarify in your plan and growth rate, you're just effectively keeping that as cash on the balance sheet for now? It's not being put into buybacks or any investments? It's just extra available cash?
John Ketchum: Yeah, exactly, Steve. We think of it as excess debt capacity that we have on the balance sheet. Utilizing that excess balance capacity is not in our current financial expectations. It's really a cushion and upside. So, if later on, we wanted to explore one of three options, one of which could be a buyback and another could be something in the regulated M&A space, or an incremental capital investment opportunity around the two main businesses. Those are opportunities to utilize that excess balance sheet capacity.
Steve Fleishman: Okay. In your 2018 guidance, it's up about $0.65 from prior midpoint. So, $0.45 of that is tax. Is there any particular item that represents the other $0.20?
John Ketchum: Yeah, it's pretty simple. We took the $6.70 and we just said, "Look, we're going to assume we're going to grow $6.70 at 8% and then add on $0.45." So, really that extra $0.20 is roughly that additional 8% off the $6.70 and targeting the midpoint of the $7.70 in '18.
Steve Fleishman: Great. Can you give us a sense against these S&P and Moody's metrics, where are you with tax reform? We have your metrics as of now, but it doesn't include with the tax reform changes in terms of FFO to debt?
John Ketchum: Yeah, we do not expect tax reform to have an impact on where the metrics currently stand. So, what I just told you takes into account tax reform.
Steve Fleishman: Okay. And then, just lastly on NEP, in terms of the communication here, the Canadian transaction might be an upside to runway and growth runway? And then, you're still just assuming the NEE portfolio as a dropdown as of year end 2016. So, anything you've done '17 and plan to do through 2020 would be additional potential growth for NEP?
John Ketchum: Exactly. NEP has terrific visibility into future growth because of that. If you locked our portfolio down as of the end of 2016, consistent with what we said the Investor Conference, that locked down portfolio was enough to support NEP's growth 12-15% through 2022. So, what we've been able to add since then is incremental to that. And, on the Canadian portfolio, we would only do that transaction if it is incrementally accretive to our long-term grown runway and puts us in a position to extend our financial expectations and potentially our need for common equity.
Steve Fleishman: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Michael Lapides: Hey, guys. Jim, I'm curious how you're thinking about this and how you and the management team will present to the board, because it's obviously a board decision. With the one-time step up in earnings guidance for 2018, how are you thinking about the dividend and whether there's a similar one-time step up in the dividend and then continued growth from there?
James L. Robo: So, as you said, it's a board decision. We have been talking about some various options over the last couple of months. In 2015, when we set the 12-14% growth rate through at least 2018, the at least was not a mistaken two words we put in front of that. We're going to be reviewing a variety of different options. Obviously, earnings are stepping up with the midpoint at $7.70, something like 15%. So, we will have some room from a payout ratio standpoint. We have a lower payout ratio than the rest of the industry does, so we have some room there as well. I'm a big believer in returning cash to shareholders, so we'll be making our recommendation here in a few weeks and we'll have an announcement sometime in February, once we make the decision at our board meeting.
Michael Lapides: Got it. Post tax reform, how does NextEra, and how do you, look at the M&A market in utilities? Does tax reform make M&A more difficult for utilities? Does it make it less difficult for utilities? We have a number of years where there has been an accelerated level of transactions. I just want to get your high-level views.
James L. Robo: I think two things, Michael. One is that it obviously takes a pretty important uncertainty off the table. You know at least what the rules of the road are for how you finance any potential acquisition going forward and what the benefits are. Secondly, I think you've seen the rating agencies put a variety of our peers on negative watch over the last couple of weeks because tax reform, all else being equal if you're 100% regulated, puts stress on your FFO to debt ratios. We've been very methodically moving our business mix to create a balance sheet capacity, and to improve our business mix over time. I think we're in a unique position relative to the rest of our peers, vis-à-vis our capacity. So, that's obviously a positive for us. That said, we're going to continue to be super disciplined about what we look at and it'll have to be accretive and make strategic sense for us. As you've seen over the years, we've been very disciplined and we haven't changed things for the sake of just getting them to close. That will continue to be how we approach M&A.
Michael Lapides: Got it. Thank you, Jim. Thanks, guys. Much appreciated.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Greg Gordan from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Greg Gordon: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Congratulations. Great numbers. Just a follow-up question, and then a new question. Your earnings were up 9%, the $0.55 that Steve Fleishman articulated, with $0.45 from tax. If I'm just thinking about the components of the other $0.20, is part of that the increased earnings power from not having bonus depreciation in '18 and beyond and the resultant increase in earnings power at the utility? And then, if I do that math, the delta would come from better outcomes at Energy Resources, ex tax reform. If so, what are you seeing that's ahead of the prior plan in Energy Resources that caused you to -- whatever that component is -- increase it by that amount?
John Ketchum: Really, we're just rebasing. If you took $6.70 and you said what's the right midpoint for 2018, we've been telling investors we'd be disappointed not to be able to grow '18 at 8% off of '17. That's your missing $0.20 to get you to the $7.70 midpoint. And then you add on $0.45 for tax reform -- and tax reform primarily reflects the reduced corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% in Energy Resources. A couple of other things in there -- a little bit of a deferred tax benefit at FPL as well -- that that's all in the $0.45. That's how you get to $7.70 as the midpoint. The midpoint for '18 is what we're targeting and what we are then going to base our future growth expectations off of at 6-8% off that 2018 $7.70 baseline going forward.
Greg Gordon: Great. With regard to the explanation of what you're doing with regard to helping FPL customers on Slide 7, would you mind walking through the steps of what happened this year and how you utilized the reserve amortization to offset the Hurricane Irma costs, and then how the reserve amortization will be replenished, and then how that positions you to then avoid having to ask customers for more money for another two years?
John Ketchum: Really simply, we had a $1.3 billion regulatory asset on our books and that asset was there because we anticipated having to charge customers $4.18-$5.50 or so in '19 and '20. So, that established a regulator asset on our books for about $1.3 billion. We then said, "Well, tax reform has occurred. Here's an opportunity to immediately return tax savings to customers by utilizing surplus in the right way." The average savings for the customer is going to be about $250.00. You'll see an immediate rate reduction of $3.38 when Matthew rolls off on March 1, and potentially the ability to avoid a base rate increase up through 2022. So, how did we do it? We wrote down the $1.3 billion. We had sufficient surplus to offset the majority of that $1.3 billion, and it's a permitted use of surplus under or settlement agreement to do that. That left roughly $50 million after tax that could not be recovered from surplus. We are excluding that from adjusted earnings as a tax reform related item. And then, as you go forward, since we start with a zero reserve amortization balance, we're able to replenish that over time through the tax savings that we get from the reduction in the federal income tax rate of 35% to 21%. Instead of immediately flowing that savings to customers over a much longer time as you amortize that benefit out, this is a way to get the savings in the customers' pocket immediately. So, that's how that works. We would expect to end 2020 with a reserve amortization balance that would be sufficient to potentially allow us to stay out of a rate case for up to two years.
Greg Gordon: That's great. I really appreciate it. Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey. Can you comment on the payout ratios here and your related thinking on that? I heard your earlier commentary about evaluating the pace of GPS growth, but can you give us a little bit of a sense of your thinking about eventual payout ratios under the new forecast? Has it evolved at all? That could give us a little bit of a sense on how you're thinking about this, if it's changed.
James L. Robo: I think what I said is probably all I'm prepared to say. It's a board decision. The industry average payout ratio is around 65%. Our current payout ratio is below that and is now, with the new rebasing we've done in 2018, will be quite below that. As I said earlier, I'm a big believer in returning cash to shareholders. We are discussing options with the board right now, and we'll have an announcement on it in a few weeks.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. As you think about some of the financing benefits from 100% expensing with tax reform as well as, I imagine, some benefits in terms of equipment costs, how has that changed your financing plan on the near side? If you could just talk about that a little bit and maybe discreetly break it up? At the same time, on the equipment side, how has that changed your outlook for '21 and even '22 at this point in terms of the near business trajectory?
John Ketchum: Two things I'll say about that. First of all, we're not limited in terms of our interest deductibility, so it really doesn't change a whole lot, the way we would approach financing those businesses. We will continue to expect tax equity dollars to be available. Again, we have always had a first call on the tax equity market, so we intend to finance the Energy Resource's renewables build in much of the same way as we have in the past. In terms of tax savings and its impact on the renewables business, a lot of those tax savings from manufacturers in particular, we would expect to hopefully see some benefit in reduced prices on the equipment side, as a result of the lower taxes that they will be paying. Armando, I don't know if you have anything you want to add to that?
Armando Pimentel: No, I think you said this a couple of times today. Things are going well at Energy Resources, and there's nothing really that happened in tax reform that upsets our plans going forward we feel really good about energy resources and that.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: To clarify, in terms of wind equipment pricing itself, how much does that cut? How much are you realizing the benefits that I suppose others are talking about and how has that changed your own views on '21 and '22? Clearly, you extended the outlook.
John Ketchum: I think what we have said is we saw a 30% reduction last year and as much as 10% going forward. Tax reform could have some incremental benefits probably on top of that. We will certainly, as always, try to squeeze our supply change to pass those benefits on to us. This is a competitive space. In order to be competitive, if you're on the equipment side and deliver the lowest price possible while retaining your profit margin, you're probably going to be expected to relay most of those tax benefits on to your customer, if you want to be competitive.
James L. Robo: Julien, just one other thing. When we talked about 30% and 10%, that's cost per kilowatt hour or cost per megawatt hour. We would expect the -- that's the way we think about it and that's how we -- it's not just turbine price. It's wind capture, balance of plant reduction in costs, and all of those things.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Excellent. Thank you. Congratulations, again. ...
Operator: This concludes today's presentation. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

John Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin my remarks on the third quarter results, I would like to say a few words about the 2017 hurricanes. As you know, residents of the Caribbean and Southern U.S. were recently impacted by the dangerous and deadly effects of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria and Nate. Our deepest sympathies are with those who have been affected by any of these storms' widespread destruction. Hurricane Irma was the largest hurricane event Florida Power & Light has ever faced. The powerful storm impacted all 35 counties and 27,000 square miles of FPL service territory, causing more than 4.4 million customers to lose power. In preparation for the hurricane, FPL assembled and pre-positioned the largest restoration workforce in U.S. history, which grew to approximately 28,000 at its peak. This preparation and coordinated response, combined with the hardening and automation investments that FPL has made since 2006 to build a stronger, smarter and more storm-resilient energy grid, enabled the company to restore service to over 2 million customers in one day and to complete the restoration of all 4.4 million customers in 10 days. The efforts of our team resulted in the fastest restoration of the largest amount of people by any one utility in U.S. history. Mutual aid in times of disaster is one of the hallmarks of our industry, and this storm was no exception. We are deeply grateful for the assistance provided by our industry partners. I would also like to personally thank each member of the restoration team, as well as the contractors, vendors and first responders that supported our efforts for their dedicated assistance during this critical time for our customers. To put Hurricane Irma in context it's useful to compare it to Hurricane Wilma from 2005, which prior to Irma was the storm that affected the largest number of FPL customers. Unlike Hurricane Irma, which made landfall in Florida as a Category 4 storm and affected the entire state, Hurricane Wilma was a Category 3 storm whose primary impacts were to the southern half of the Florida peninsula. Based upon a methodology developed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research, Hurricane Irma had an approximately 50% higher damage potential than Hurricane Wilma and resulted in over 90% of FPL customers losing power compared to 75% for Hurricane Wilma. Notwithstanding the fact that Hurricane Irma was a much stronger storm impacting a larger portion of FPL service territory, there was an approximately 80% reduction to pole damage and an 80% improvement in the time to energize all substations following the storm when compared to Hurricane Wilma. After day one, FPL had 50% of its customers restored; also an 80% improvement compared to the Wilma restoration efforts. In fact, 95% of customers impacted by Irma were restored in one week and while the average customer outage from Hurricane Wilma lasted for over five days, the average outage for customers affected by Hurricane Irma was roughly two days, a 60% improvement. The total GDP within our service territory averages over $1 billion per day. By reducing the average customer outage by more than three days when compared to Wilma, we believe the avoided economic loss to the state has more than paid for the $3 billion in hardening investments we have made since 2006. Given the size and scale of this hurricane, the Florida Public Service Commission has opened a docket to solicit customer comments and to take evidence on the statewide utility response to Irma, including an analysis of the impact prior hardening activities had on restoration efforts. We believe that the improvement in FPL's storm restoration effort shows that our ongoing transmission and distribution investments together with our preparation and coordinated response are providing significant value to our customers. In an effort to mitigate a significant bill impact for our customers related to the cost recovery for Hurricane Irma, we currently expect to propose a surcharge equivalent to $4 on a 1,000-kilowatt hour residential bill beginning in March of 2018, which equates to a step-up of $0.64 from a surcharge related to Hurricane Matthew that rolls off at that time. Subject to a review and prudence determination of our final storm cost by the Florida Public Service Commission, which are preliminarily estimated to be approximately $1.3 billion, we expect this surcharge to increase by roughly $1.50 to approximately $5.50 per month in 2019 and stay at that level until the storm costs are fully recovered, which is expected by the end of 2020. Turning now to our financial performance, NextEra Energy delivered solid third quarter results and building upon strong progress made in the first half of the year remains well positioned to achieve our overall objectives for 2017. NextEra Energy's third quarter adjusted earnings per share increased by $0.11 or 6.3% against the prior year quarter, primarily reflecting contributions from new investments at both Florida Power & Light and Energy Resources. Year-to-date, we have grown adjusted earnings per share by 9.2% compared to the prior year comparable period. We also executed well on major initiatives, including continuing to capitalize on one of the best renewable development periods in our history. At Florida Power & Light, earnings per share increased $0.08 from the prior year comparable quarter. Strong growth was driven by continued investment in the business to maintain our best-in-class customer value proposition of clean energy, low bills, high reliability and outstanding customer service. We earned a regulatory ROE of approximately 11.5%, and average regulatory capital employed grew roughly 9.8% over the same quarter last year. All of our major capital initiatives remain on track, including the 1,750 megawatt Okeechobee Clean Energy Center and construction of the eight 74.5 megawatt solar energy centers that are currently being built under the solar base rate adjustment or SoBRA mechanism of the rate case settlement agreement. We were also pleased that the Florida Public Service Commission approved the settlement agreement with the Office of Public Counsel for the early phase-out of the St. Johns River Power Park helping to further reduce costs for FPL customers and lower emissions for Florida residents. At Energy Resources, adjusted EPS increased by roughly 3% year-over-year as contributions from new investments more than offset a negative contribution from our existing assets as a result of poor fleet-wide wind resource, which was the lowest on record for the months of July through September over the past 30 years. Following the success of recent quarters, it was another excellent period of new project origination. Since the last call, our development organization has added 760 megawatts of long-term contracted projects to our backlog, including the largest announced combined solar plus storage project in the United States. This continued cost and efficiency improvements in wind and solar technology support compelling renewable economics that remain the primary driver of ongoing customer origination activity. Energy Resources continued to advance our wind repowering program as well, adding 514 megawatts to our repowering backlog for 2018 delivery. We also commissioned more than 300 megawatts of repowering projects and closed the first tax equity financing for a wind repowering portfolio. Finally, we were pleased to receive the FERC certificate for MVP and look forward to advancing construction activities to support a year-end 2018 commercial operation date. Overall, with three strong quarters complete in 2017, we are pleased with the progress we are making at NextEra Energy and are well positioned to achieve the full year financial expectations that we have previously discussed subject to our usual caveats. Now, let's look at the detailed results beginning with FPL. For the third quarter of 2017, FPL reported net income of $566 million or $1.19 per share, an increase of $51 million and $0.08 per share, respectively year-over-year. Regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 9.8% over the same quarter last year and was the principal driver of FPL's net income growth of 9.9%. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $1 billion in the third quarter and we continue to expect our full year capital investments to total between $5 billion and $5.4 billion. Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.5% for the 12 months ended September 2017. As a reminder, under the current rate agreement, we record reserve amortization entries to achieve a pre-determined regulatory ROE for each trailing 12-month period. During the third quarter, we reversed $124 million of reserve amortization after offsetting the impacts of Hurricane Irma, leaving us with a balance of roughly $1.15 billion which can be utilized over the remainder of our settlement agreement. We continue to expect the flexibility provided by the utilization of our reserve amortization, coupled with our weather normalized sales forecast at current CapEx and O&M expectations to support our target regulatory ROE of 11.5% for the full year 2017, which is at the upper end of the allowed band of 9.6% to 11.6% under our current settlement agreement. Each of our ongoing capital deployment initiatives continues to progress well as we focus on delivering our best-in-class customer value proposition. Construction on the approximately 1,750 megawatt Okeechobee Clean Energy Center remains on schedule and under budget. The eight solar sites totaling nearly 600 megawatts of combined capacity are currently being built across FPL service territory and are all on track and on budget to begin providing cost effective energy to FPL customers later this year and in early 2018. We also continue to advance the development of the additional 1,600 megawatts of solar projects that are planned for beyond 2018 and have currently secured potential sites that could support more than 5 gigawatts of FPL's ongoing solar expansion. Last month, the Florida Public Service Commission approved the settlement agreement between FPL and the Office of Public Counsel, the consumer advocate in Florida, regarding FPL's proposal for the early shutdown of the St. John's River Power Park and approximately 1,300 megawatt coal-fired plant jointly owned with JEA. The early retirement of the plant, which is expected in January 2018 is projected to provide total savings to FPL customers of $183 million and prevent nearly 5.6 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually, adding to the customer savings and emission reductions of our Cedar Bay and Indiantown transactions. Earlier this month, we filed the determination of need with the FPSC for the roughly 1,200 megawatt highly efficient, clean-burning natural gas Dania Beach Clean Energy Center. The project which has a total expected capital investment of approximately $900 million is a modernization of our existing Lauderdale Plant and is expected to begin operation by mid-2022. Consistent with our focus on low bills, we estimate that the facility will generate more than $335 million in net cost savings for FPL customers over its operational life. Finally, we were pleased that earlier in the week, the city of Vero Beach City Council approved FPL's purchase of substantially all of the assets of the municipal electric system for approximately $185 million. We are continuing to work on the remaining necessary approvals and hope to be in a position to close the transaction in late 2018. If we are successful, we look forward to Vero Beach's roughly 34,000 customers benefiting from FPL's best-in-class customer value proposition, including rates that are among the lowest in the state. Despite the effects of Hurricane Irma, the Florida economy remains strong. Florida seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 3.8% in September, down more than 1% from a year earlier and the lowest in over 10 years. As an indicator of new construction, newbuilding permits remain at healthy levels. The most recent reading of the Case-Shiller Index for South Florida shows home prices up 5.3% from the prior year, while mortgage delinquency rates continue to decline. Overall, Florida's economy continues to grow with the latest ratings of Florida's consumer confidence near post-recession highs. FPL's average number of customers in the third quarter increased by roughly 62,000 or 1.3% year-over-year. For the third quarter, we estimate that warmer weather had a positive year-over-year impact on usage per customer of approximately 1.6% and that Hurricane Irma had a negative impact of approximately 3.5%. After taking these factors into account, third quarter sales decreased 3% on a weather normalized basis, which reflects continued customer growth more than offset by an estimated decline in usage per customer of 1.7%. With the increased uncertainty in our estimate of weather normalized usage per customer as a result of Hurricane Irma, we are unable to draw any firm conclusions about long-term trends in underlying usage. We will continue to closely monitor and analyze underlying usage going forward. As a reminder, modest changes in usage per customer are not likely to have a material effect on earnings over the course of the settlement agreement, as we will adjust the level of reserve amortization utilization to offset any effect, which would allow us to maintain our target regulatory ROE. Overall, despite the effects of the hurricane, the underlying Florida economy remains strong, supporting ongoing customer growth. And primarily due to weather – warmer than expected temperatures, we have utilized less reserved amortization than expected through the first three quarters. Assuming normal weather and operating conditions, we currently expect to end 2017 with a reserve amortization balance of more than $1.1 billion that can be utilized over the remainder of the settlement agreement. Our capital initiatives to further enhance our already best-in-class customer value proposition are also progressing well. These smart capital investments are expected to deliver a regulatory capital employed compound annual growth rate of roughly 8% per year from 2017 through 2020. We are pleased with FPL's year-to-date execution and we'll continue to maintain a relentless focus on delivering low bills, high reliability, clean energy and outstanding customer service. Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported third quarter 2017 GAAP and adjusted earnings of $292 million or $0.62 per share. Energy Resources contribution to adjusted EPS increased by $0.02 from last year's comparable quarter. New investments contributed $0.12 per share, primarily reflecting continued growth in our contracted renewables program. As I previously mentioned, third quarter fleet-wide wind resource was the lowest on record over the past 30 years at 87% of the long-term average versus 101% in the third quarter of last year. The weaker wind resource in the third quarter was the primary driver of the negative $0.03 contribution from existing generation assets relative to the prior year comparable quarter. All other impacts reduced results by $0.07 per share, including the effects of increased interest expense. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide. As I mentioned earlier, we signed contracts for 760 megawatts of new projects since the last call. In addition to the 566 megawatts of wind for 2018 delivery, we successfully originated 164 megawatts of solar for delivery between 2018 and 2020, and the 30 megawatt battery storage project that will be paired with one of the solar PPAs. This project is the largest combined solar and storage facility in United States announced today. This strong quarter of origination activity is consistent with recent trends and reflective of continued strong customer demand driven largely by wind and solar economics. The combination of low cost wind or solar energy paired with a low cost battery storage solution provides a product that can be dispatched with enough certainty to meet customer needs for a firm generation resource. Today, we are able to offer this firm wind or solar resource for a lower cost than the operating cost of traditional inefficient generation resources. As we have previously discussed, with continued equipment cost declines and efficiency gains as the tax efficiencies phase down early in the next decade, we expect new firm wind and firm solar without incentives to be cheaper than the operating cost of coal, nuclear and less fuel efficient oil and gas fire generation units, creating significant opportunities for renewables growth going forward. Our wind repowering efforts also continue to progress. As I previously mentioned, we added 514 megawatts to our repowering backlog, including approximately 241 megawatts of contractor projects that have new PPA extensions in place. Our wind repowering backlog now stands at over 2,300 megawatts, all for 2017 and 2018 delivery. During the quarter, Energy Resources successfully commissioned an additional 308 megawatts of wind repowering projects. We also closed our first tax equity financing related to wind repowering, raising roughly $243 million on a portfolio of 327 megawatts of projects. We continue to expect to invest a total of between $2.5 billion and $3 billion for repowerings through 2020. The progress we have made this quarter reflects the continued strong outlook for renewables development and we believe that by leveraging Energy Resources' competitive advantages, we are well-positioned to capture a meaningful share of the wind and solar markets going forward. The attached chart provides additional detail on where our renewables development program now stands. Beyond renewables, we continue to make good progress on the Mountain Valley Pipeline. Earlier this month, we received the FERC certificate for MVP. We are working to complete final development activities and expect to begin advancing construction efforts to support a December 2018 in service date. NextEra Energy's expected investment is approximately $1.1 billion. Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy, for the third quarter of 2017 GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $847 million or $1.79 per share. NextEra Energy's 2017 third quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $875 million and $1.85 per share respectively. Adjusted earnings from the Corporate and Other segment increased $0.01 per share compared to the third quarter of 2016. Earlier this month, our transmission team was selected by the New York Independent System Operator to develop a 20-mile 345 kV transmission line in a company facility located near Buffalo, New York. The project is New York ISO's first competitive transmission award under its Public Policy Transmission Planning Process. It will help the state to maximize the flow of energy from lower cost renewable generation. The project is required to be in service by June 2022 and our investment is expected to total roughly $180 million. We are very pleased with this recent success, and although a very competitive business, look to build on that success with other opportunities going forward. For 2017, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share at NextEra Energy to be in the range of $6.35 to $6.85. We currently expect lower growth in the fourth quarter as we are pursuing several refinancing initiatives to capitalize on favorable market conditions that could drive up to roughly $150 million of NPV savings on a cash basis, but will result in a reduction in net income when they close later this year. For example, we recently announced the refinancing of $750 million of Capital Holdings hybrid securities. While this transaction produces more than $50 million of NPV savings on a cash basis, it will result in a net income reduction of approximately $13 million in the fourth quarter. Despite this, we continue to believe we are well positioned to achieve full year results at or near the upper end of our previously disclosed 6% to 8% adjusted earnings per share compound annual growth rate expectations off our 2016 base. For the full year 2017, we expect cash flow from operations to grow above our adjusted EPS growth rate, after adjusting for impacts from certain FPL clause recoveries, storm costs and recoveries in the Indiantown acquisition. Looking further ahead, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share in the range of $6.80 to $7.30 for 2018 and in the range of $7.85 to $8.45 for 2020, applying a compound annual growth rate off a 2016 base of 6% to 8%. With the overall strength and diversity of our growth prospects of both FPL and Energy Resources, and based on everything we see now, we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our 6% to 8% range through 2020. We continue to expect to grow our dividends per share 12% to 14% per year through at least 2018 off a 2015 base of dividends per share of $3.08. As always all of our expectations are subject to the usual caveats, including but not limited to normal weather and operating conditions. Although it is still premature to draw any firm conclusions, we wanted to provide an update on the potential impacts of the recent tax reform proposal on our long-term adjusted EPS expectations. We have modeled the scenario making certain assumptions based on the framework that was released on September 27 by the Trump administration, the House Committee on Ways and Means and the Senate Committee on Finance. Off our 2020 baseline, we would expect the scenario to be roughly $0.20 to $0.30 per share accretive. We continue to be actively engaged in the tax reform discussion and we'll provide further updates as the ultimate direction of and progress on tax reform becomes clear. In summary, NextEra Energy remains on track to meet its 2017 expectations and we remain as enthusiastic as ever about our future growth prospects. At FPL, our ongoing focus is on operational cost effectiveness, productivity and making smart long-term investments to further improve the quality, reliability, and efficiency of everything we do. At Energy Resources, we continue to make terrific progress on our development program and remain optimistic about our renewables growth prospects as a result of improving equipment costs and efficiencies and ongoing advancements in energy storage. Overall, we continue to believe that we have one of the best opportunity sets in our industry and that we are well positioned to continue to deliver on our growth expectations going forward. Let me now turn to NEP. Yesterday, the NEP board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.3925 per common unit, continuing our track record of growing distributions at the top end of our 12% to 15% per year growth range. We are pleased to announce that following approval by the Conflicts Committee of the NextEra Energy Partners Board, NEP has reached an agreement to acquire four additional assets from Energy Resources, adding to what we view as an already best-in-class portfolio with an average 18-year contract life and counterparty credit rating of A3 following the acquisition. These assets are expected to further enhance the quality and diversity of NEP's existing portfolio and to complete the growth necessary to achieve our previously outlined year-end 2017 adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution run rate expectations. We expect the transaction, which is anticipated to be funded with the issuance of the $550 million of previously announced convertible preferred units and cash on hand, to yield a double-digit return to NEP's unitholders and to be accretive to LP distributions. I will provide additional details on the transaction in a few minutes. Building upon the changes we have pursued this year to further improve NEP's investor value proposition, including the governance enhancements, the modified IDR structure, standalone credit ratings in the mid-to-high BB category, and the agreement to issue $550 million of convertible preferred units, NEP demonstrated its ability to access additional low-cost sources of capital this quarter with the issuances of $300 million of 3-year convertible debt and a total of $1.1 billion of 7-year and 10-year senior unsecured notes at historically low yields. Today we are also announcing that we have upsized and extended NEP's revolving credit facility to further enhance NEP's financial flexibility and strengthen its standalone prospects going forward. I will provide additional details on each of these financings in just a moment. Consistent with our long-term growth prospects, today we are introducing December 31, 2018 run rate expectations reflecting roughly 22% and 17% growth, respectively, from the comparable year-end 2017 run rate adjusted EBITDA and CAFD midpoints. Overall, we are pleased with the year-to-date execution in NEP and are well positioned to meet our 2017 and longer-term expectations. Now, let's look at the detailed results for NEP. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $178 million and cash available for distribution was $47 million, up approximately 2% and down roughly 8% from the prior year comparable quarter, respectively. Poor wind resource had a meaningful impact on NEP's assets. Fleet-wide wind resource was 82%, the lowest third quarter on record over the last 30 years, compared to 95% for the third quarter in 2016. Although still early in the fourth quarter, wind resource has begun to return to more normal levels in October. On a year-to-date basis, adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution have increased by 15% and 10%, respectively. As a reminder, these results are net of IDR fees, which we treat as an operating expense. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide. As I previously mentioned, the NEP board declared a quarterly distribution of $39.25 per common unit or $1.57 per common unit on an annualized basis, an increase of approximately 15% from a year earlier. NEP completed multiple financing transactions this quarter, further demonstrating its ability to access a variety of capital sources. In early September, NEP issued $300 million of convertible notes due in 2020 at a 1.5% coupon. The notes have the potential to convert into equity at a 25% premium to the September 6, 2017 closing price of $42.29. Consistent with our desire to achieve the top end of NEP's growth expectations, the conversion rate has been structured to allow an approximate 15% annualized growth rate in distributions per unit without an adjustment to the conversion rate. Concurrently with the debt issuance, NEP purchased a capped call that provides economic and dilution protection up to a 50% premium to the September 6 closing price. In September, NEP also issued $550 million of both 7-year and 10-year senior unsecured notes to refinance approximately $1.1 billion in existing secured holding company debt that had maturities in 2018 and 2019. We believe the strong demand for the offering, which was more than 5.5 times oversubscribed is indicative of NEP's superior value proposition supported by diversified cash flows from long-term contracts with strong creditworthy counterparties. The transaction priced at historical lows, including the lowest spread in coupon for a Ba1, BB U.S. dollar offering on the 7-year tranche and the lowest coupon for a Ba1, BB USD offering on the 10-year tranche. As I just mentioned, today we are also announcing amendments to our existing revolving credit facility. In addition to lower borrowing rates, the facility will be upsized from $250 million to $750 million and the maturity will be extended from July 2019 to October 2022. We believe that the strong demand from 20 banks to participate in the amended credit facility is reflective of the core strengths that separate NEP from other infrastructure alternatives. We continue to expect to target total HoldCo leverage to project distributions of 3 times to 4 times at year-end 2017, and consistent with NEP's credit ratings, total HoldCo leverage to project distributions of 4 times to 5 times over the longer term. We believe these leverage targets are supported by NEP's amortizing project debt and long-term contracted portfolio and are consistent with our experience in financing clean energy assets. As a result of this financing flexibility, aside from any modest issuances under the aftermarket program, or issuances upon the conversion of NEP's convertible securities, we continue to expect that NextEra Energy Partners will not need to sell common equity until 2020 at the earliest. Beyond the new financings, the previously announced NEP governance enhancements which will give LP unitholders among other rights the ability to elect a majority of the NEP board beginning at the shareholder meeting to be held later this year, we also implemented during the quarter. As I previously mentioned, we continue to execute on our plan to expand NEP's portfolio with the agreement to acquire four additional assets from Energy Resources. This portfolio is a geographically diverse mix of wind and solar projects collectively consisting of approximately 691 megawatts, including the acquisition of a 25.9% indirect interest in the Desert Sunlight Solar Energy Center. The portfolio has a cash available for distribution weighted to remaining contract life of 22 years. The transaction is expected to close by year-end subject to customary closing conditions and the receipt of certain regulatory approvals and represents another step toward growing LP unit distributions in a manner consistent with our previously stated expectations of 12% to 15% per year through at least 2022. NEP expects to acquire the portfolio for total consideration of approximately $812 million subject to working capital and other adjustments, plus the assumption of approximately $459 million in liabilities related to tax equity financing and considers approximately $268 million of existing non-recourse project debt related to the Desert Sunlight project. The acquisition is expected to contribute adjusted EBITDA of approximately $185 million to $205 million and cash available for distribution of approximately $79 million to $89 million, each on a five-year average annual run rate basis beginning December 31, 2017. The purchase price for the transaction is expected to be funded through the issuance of $550 million of previously announced convertible preferred units with the balance funded with cash on hand as a result of NEP's recent convertible debt financing. Additional details are shown in the accompanying slide. Following the acquisition of this portfolio from Energy Resources, we expect the NEP assets to support the previously announced December 31, 2017 run rate expectations, reflecting calendar year 2018 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at year-end 2017 for adjusted EBITDA of $875 million to $975 million and CAFD of $310 million to $340 million. Since we currently expect today's announced acquisition to close later in the fourth quarter, we do not expect the portfolio to provide a meaningful contribution to fourth quarter 2017 adjusted EBITDA or cash available for distribution. As I mentioned earlier, consistent with our previously announced long-term growth prospects, today we are introducing December 31, 2018 run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA of $1.05 billion to $1.2 billion and CAFD of $360 million to $400 million, reflecting calendar year 2019 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at year-end 2018. Our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and are net of anticipated IDR fees as we treat these as an operating expense. From a base of our fourth quarter 2016 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $1.41, we continue to see 12% to 15% per year growth in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2022. With the acquisitions announced today, we expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2017 distribution, meaning the fourth quarter distribution that is payable in February 2018, to be at the top end of our previously disclosed range of $1.58 to $1.62 per common unit. While we cannot draw any firm conclusions about the impact of tax reform on NEP, we expect that the most reasonable scenario is NEP's U.S. federal income tax shield, which is currently greater than 15 years and NEP's earnings to profits balance, which is currently expected to remain negative for at least the next eight years will not be materially affected. We are pleased with the progress NEP has made over 2017 and we are well positioned to achieve our full year financial expectations. Upon the closing of the announced acquisition from Energy Resources, we have successfully executed on our growth strategy for the year. We believe NEP continues to provide a best-in-class investor value proposition. As we have previously outlined, NEP has the flexibility to grow in three ways, acquiring assets from Energy Resources organically or acquiring assets from other third parties. NEP also has a cost of capital and access to capital advantage with substantial flexibility to finance its long-term growth as was further demonstrated by the transactions completed this quarter. These advantages, together with the stability of NEP's cash flows backed by the portfolio's long-term average contract life and strong counterparty credit profile, amortizing debt, tax position, enhanced governance rights, and long-term growth expectations through at least 2022, all support NEP's favorable position relative to other yieldcos and MLPs. NextEra Energy Partners continues to make excellent progress against the strategic and growth initiatives and we remain as enthusiastic as ever about NEP's long-term prospects. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that we'll open the line for questions. QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSION
Operator: Thank you. We'll go to Stephen Byrd, Morgan Stanley.
Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning.
John Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Good morning, Stephen.
Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I wanted to check in on your excess balance sheet capacity and just generally your balance sheet strength. You've been putting up additional wins in the renewables business, and it looks like there's also upside at the utility. When we think about using that excess balance sheet capacity, do you see significant organic opportunities at the different business units? Or do you think you're likely to still have excess balance sheet capacity through the end of the decade?
John Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Okay. So first of all, the excess balance sheet capacity is about $3 billion to $5 billion through 2020. And when you look at the financial plan that we have laid out through 2020 at the Investor conference, the CapEx that we already have planned for the FPL business and the Energy Resources business does not take into account that $3 billion to $5 billion of excess balance sheet capacity. So what do we do with it? We have a few options. I think our preferred option would be to find incremental capital investment opportunities that drive long-term value for shareholders and that also help to create growth post-2020, which we view as being strong given all the potential growth platform opportunities that we have in the next decade, given where we see renewables and also given all the opportunities that FPL has on Eric's side of the business.
Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Understood. Thank you. Just shifting gears to storage, you made some interesting remarks about storage, and I guess we are hearing that storage solicitations are now a regular part of a lot of renewable procurements. I was just curious to your opinion as to whether we're currently in the right zip code that you think many customers will opt for storage linked with renewables, or do you think that's a few years down the road? What's your sense of the likely customer appetite over the next couple of years for storage linked with renewables and PPA?
John Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Yeah. Storage is very real now. And I think, as evidenced by the project we announced today with the 30 megawatts tied to an existing solar project, making it the largest combined solar plus storage project in the U.S. But when you look at where storage economics are, storage costs continue to come down significantly, efficiency continues to improve at a rate where we can now combine storage with solar and really, you know, beat the pricing, the existing variable cost just operate a nuclear or coal plant and be pretty darned competitive even with combined cycle gas facilities. And what's the result of that? Because of that, on almost every solar procurement that we are betting on today counterparties are asking us not only for a solar bid, but also for a combined solar plus storage bid. They clearly understand the benefits that are created by the firm, dispatchability of the combined product. So the short answer is we're already here and things should only continue to improve as we go forward and as tax incentives phase down in the next decade and you can combine storage, which will be even lower cost, even more efficient with an even lower cost and more efficient solar panel and balance of system cost. We see that as a very viable product going forward and we also are continuing to look for opportunities to combine solar with wind or storage with wind. And with that, I don't know if Armando has anything that he would like to add?
Armando Pimentel - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Hey Stephen, real quick. Recall that at the Investor Conference, what we laid out was roughly $700 million of CapEx opportunities in the storage market through 2020. We continue to think that's a good number. That doesn't mean that customers aren't significantly interested in what's going on and proactively asking for bids. And even as the cost estimate comes down, we continue to believe that this is going to be a significant opportunity early part of the next decade.
Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's super helpful. Thank you. I'll get back in the queue.
Operator: We'll go next to Steve Fleishman, Wolfe Research.
Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC: Yeah. Hi. Good morning. Just one question on the NEP financing for the new drops. Could you just repeat kind of the financing plan that you laid out for the new drops yesterday?
John Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely, Steve. So for the new drops remember right around the time of the investor conference, we completed the $550 million convertible preferred offering at a 4.5% coupon, lowest coupon ever for a convertible offering. That will comprise the lion's share of the $812 million equity price for that acquisition. The balance will come from cash on hand, that cash on hand is really coming from the convertible debt offering that we closed on in September at a 1.5% coupon, was up 25% and then the capped call on top of that given us economic consideration up to – up 50%.
Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you.
John Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Thanks, Steve.
Operator: We go next to Greg Gordon, Evercore Partners.
Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI: The first is, you've reclassified a significant chunk of your wind assets from merchant to contract and then there's a footnote that describes why, but could you go into some more detail as to what the underlying assumptions are that with regard to the profitability of those assets and why they've shifted?
John Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Yeah. It's really pretty simple. So those are repowering assets that were formally ERCOT merchant assets. And the way the economics works is that roughly 90% of the gross margin comes from the production tax credit, so 90% of the gross margin comes from the Production Tax Credit, so you can think of the PTC as essentially being a contractual head. So every megawatt hour that we're generating, we're getting paid $24 on that megawatt hour for 90% of the gross margin. And so given that and also the fact that some of those projects will carry financial hedges going forward, the more appropriate classification over the next 10 years during the PTC period is as a contracted asset.
Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI: Well, that makes a pretty underlying strong statement about the incremental IRR we're getting on the repowerings of the vast majority of your return at the hurdle rate is coming just from getting the PTCs without worrying about a substantial energy margin, is that the right way to think about it?
John Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Well, yeah, I mean, remember too, I mean it's about half the CapEx and because it's half the CapEx you're getting the driver from the PTCs, and then energy is the upside. That's why we've said the unlevered IRRs are a few ticks up from what we would get on a newbuild wind project.
Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI: Fantastic. My second question is, if you would humor us, can you delineate what the basic assumptions you're assuming are in your baseline tax case?
John Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Yeah. I mean it's really what came out on September 27, so you can think of it as a 20% corporate tax rate, 100% immediate expensing and then we've made an assumption on what the interest limitation is that I'm probably not going to share on this call.
Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI: Fair enough, but the industry EI has been lobbying on behalf of the industry to try and achieve an off-ramp or an exemption on interest deductibility and bonus depreciation, correct?
John Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Well, I'll let Jim take it.
James L. Robo - NextEra Energy, Inc.: So, Greg, listen. I just think on tax reform, it's very fluid right now. Obviously the industry has been weighing in. I've been spending a lot of time on it. And we don't even have a bill out of House Ways and Means yet. So I think it's too early really to say anything about where any of this, where any of this stands other than you can rest assured I'm highly engaged on this.
Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI: Thank you, guys. I appreciate it. Have a good day.
John Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Thanks, Greg.
Operator: We'll go to Michael Lapides, Goldman Sachs.
Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Yeah. Hey, guys. Couple of questions. One probably for Armando, which is, can you talk about, when you think about your renewable pipeline, how much of that is the counterparty, a traditional regulated utility versus how much of it is a corporate entity, whether a big tech company or someone else?
Armando Pimentel - NextEra Energy, Inc.: So, Michael, right now for us I'd say 90% of what we're doing is probably the more traditional customers and those could be the rate-regulated utilities or the munis and co-ops. And I'd say 5% to 10% are the latter, which you asked about or the corporate entities, what we call C&I companies. We continue to see more C&I companies out there and actually we are engaging in that business more proactively today than we have in the past. I would expect for us that 5% to 10% to go up.
Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. And then, guys, how are you thinking about the Section 201 case and some of the recent developments and what that could do if any to solar-related demands, really for 2018 solar demands, but even for the next few years?
James L. Robo - NextEra Energy, Inc.: So Michael, this is Jim. Obviously, it's something that we're watching very closely. I think, I spoke on this issue in September. We're fine in 2017 and 2018, because we pre-bought our panels when we saw this going on. 2019 is probably the year we're most concerned about. That's probably where there is a potentially a pinch point depending on where the ITC comes out and where the administration comes out on this. Post-2019, I think there's going to be, the market's going to – the market will have time to react to whatever happens and I think we'll get back to normal business in 2020 and beyond. But 2019 is our focus and we're working quite hard on a number of fronts and it's something that we're watching closely and we're highly engaged on it and the whole team is highly engaged on it across the board.
Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated.
John Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Thanks, Michael.
Operator: We'll go next to Julien Dumoulin-Smith, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey. Actually let me start real quickly on the 201 issue there, if I can. What are you expecting when you talk about 2019 and really beyond that in terms of market reaction? I mean, what's your kind of playbook as far as you see this playing out right now? And then secondly, what is your expectation in terms of the positioning of parties and thinking about how this could actually play out over the next few months? Is a settlement possible, et cetera, to make this a little bit more palatable?
James L. Robo - NextEra Energy, Inc.: So Julian, it's Jim again. I just think it's too early to tell what's going to happen here and I think – you know, honestly, there's a pretty broad range of potential outcomes on this and I wouldn't care to speculate on what's going to happen. I think we'll see where – and what we're doing is frankly scenario planning across a variety of different outcomes and making sure that we're going to be prepared in case of any potential outcome.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Excellent. Well, and looking beyond the current 2020 period, you guys have done a fantastic job in the repowering side thus far. I'm curious, how are you thinking about repowering opportunities under kind of a sub-100% PTC, call it 80%, 60%? I mean, you've been pretty forward-looking before across the industry and this seems like an opportunity to pivot. Are you engaging with parties on that front? I mean, do you have an expectation for an ability to use those PTCs that are expire – say, 2012, 2013 and 2014 vintage projects as they come off in the early part of the next decade and repower those?
Armando Pimentel - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Hey, Julian. This is Armando. (54:18)
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: I'm just thinking in the longer term. Yeah.
Armando Pimentel - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Yeah. Look, most of what – not most, just about everything of what we're doing today is to make sure that we can grab the – as many of these repowering opportunities through 2020 having safe harbored a good part of that equipment in order to get the 100% production tax credits. There's already been, excuse me, one entity out there, which I'm sure you've seen that has announced a project where they would be getting 80% production tax credits and the economics work for them under that scenario. Our expectation is that when the production tax credit goes down to 80%, that there are actually going to be some repowering opportunities that are going to work, maybe not necessarily for the reasons that some might believe. When we're looking at repowering opportunities, one of the things that we're looking at it is how close is the old asset, if you will, to the end of its PTC life, right? And if it's nine or ten years into its life, taking the asset down and repowering it and putting it up and getting 100% PTCs for ten years might work. But if it's at the end of 2020, if it's only gone through seven years, let's say, you wouldn't necessarily want to repower the asset at that point and lose three years of the old PTCs. But if you wait another year, now you're at eight years or nine years, it may actually make sense to give up one year of the old PTCs and get ten years of the 80% PTCs. So that scenario planning is something that we are spending a little bit of time right now. We certainly have a lot of assets that would be subject to that. But I do believe that there are going to be repowering opportunities that work with 80% PTCs.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Excellent. Well, thank you all very much.
John Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Paul Ridzon, KeyBanc.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Good morning. John, I think on the second quarter call, you said look for most of the second half growth to hit the fourth quarter, I'm just kind of trying to calibrate, we saw a 6.5% growth in the third quarter here. Did some of that growth shift quarters, and then just how do I think about the subpar wind resource you had in the quarter? How does that figure into the (56:46) numbers?
John Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Yeah. So, by the time of the second quarter call, we were pretty well into July, which was not a terrific wind resource month. We were concerned about the trend for the rest of the quarter for August and September, August ended up kind of following suit with July and we were a little bit surprised because September rebounded a little bit more than we had expected, I think September ended up being about 95% of normal, now we've seen October has truly rebounded so far this month. That was part of it. We had a little bit better performance out of other miscellaneous parts of the business, none worth pointing out individually that when added up put us in a little bit better position than what we were expecting for the quarter including some origination activity that we had on the business.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And so we think about that incremental positive as essentially being offset in the fourth quarter by the refinancings you talked about?
John Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Yeah. And so, the fourth quarter, that's why I think I made the comment that growth would be down a little bit in the fourth quarter. We have really been focused on liability management. When you look at our portfolio – one of things that I've made a comment on at the investor conference is, if you look at our financing portfolio, we have one of the longest average tenors combined with one of the lowest average interest rates of any of our peers. And that's because we constantly look at the portfolio for refinancing activity opportunities. And those are the opportunities we're looking to execute on in the fourth quarter. The remarks were that the MPV could be as high as $150 million, obviously those come with some prepayment penalties that do have some book impacts associated with them, but we're just trying to continue our trend of being very mindful that we're in an attractive low interest rate environment and looking at the balance sheet as we always do, to be opportunistic, and that's what you can expect to be reflected in the fourth quarter results.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And you don't treat those kind of one-timey make wholes or anything as unusual items?
John Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: No. We've flown through.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much.
John Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Yep. Thanks, Paul.
Operator: We'll go next to Shar Pourreza, Guggenheim Partners.
Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Hi, everyone. Just a quick follow-up on the battery storage comments, John. The Dania filings that you filed for showed that the asset was materially more economical than battery storage and solar, even in the 2022 timeframe. So I'm curious on sort of how that fits in with your viewpoint that batteries, plus solar could be economical with the CCGT? And then just a follow-up on Dania is looking at FPL's gas assets, there are other plants that fit to similar economics as sort of the plant that you're converting. So I'm kind of curious if the Dania plant is a one-off and do you see other opportunities thus far?
John Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Yeah. I think we'll just tackle the Dania piece first. The Dania piece first is, one, you got to consider its location, I mean, it's in South Florida, it has a transmission advantage given its location. If you look at the economics on the reduced O&M, on improving the fuel efficiency of that facility, given its location, that's why that one works. We continue to look for other opportunities, we have the 50-megawatt battery storage pilot program in Florida where we will look to do a lot of the same things we've done on the Energy Resources side including the project we announced today where we can actually combine our storage capability with newbuild solar in Florida. And those opportunities will come about not only through the eight facilities we're currently building, but then the 6,300 post-2018. Where exactly they will end up will depend on where they are located in the overall economics of those facilities. But it's a terrific opportunity for Florida to take advantage of the same opportunities that our regulated customer base outside of Florida are looking for. Jim?
James L. Robo - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Shar, this is Jim. Just one other thing on storage and renewable competitiveness is, we see storage and renewables really competing very well against inefficient old operating nuclear and coal plants where you look at the economics of those sites, they're anywhere from $0.04 to $0.05 on a cash cost per kilowatt hour basis to operate. These new CCGGs, particularly in a constrained place like Dania Beach are very, very cost effective and super fuel efficient and typically you wouldn't see renewables and storage competing with that just yet.
Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Got it. That's helpful. Thanks so much.
Operator: We'll go next to Chris Turnure, JPMorgan.
Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Good morning. Given you guys probably have maybe six or so months to go to kind of finish out the 2017 to 2018 bucket of renewable backlog, could you just give us an update on how you might fall out within that 4 gigawatt range, you're coming up on the bottom now. Will any of it kind of spill into 2019 in terms of your maybe original expectations? Has anything changed in the last three to six months?
John Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Yeah. So first, we're already there on solar, not only there on solar for 2017 and 2018, we're pretty darn close to our range for 2019 and 2020. And we look to continue to add to that obviously going forward. And then on the wind side, given the 760 megawatt total portfolio today, the wind additions that were part of that, we're within striking distance on wind and I'll let Armando fill in the details or kind of his viewpoint.
Armando Pimentel - NextEra Energy, Inc.: So for wind, and this is – this has been the case for a long time, right. When folks are looking for wind, they're looking out much shorter – at a much shorter time period. One of the things that I'm honestly most happy about so far in this cycle is we have almost 900 megawatts of wind signed up already for 2019 and 2020. But when you're focused on 2017 and 2018 and particularly on wind, there's the current – there's just the recent history that we announced today of signing 560 megawatts of 2018 wind. And I can tell you that we are working on a pretty decent backlog for additional 2018 wind right now, whether that happens or not, it depends. Customers understand that if they wait a little longer that the prices could be a little cheaper, and so you're always fighting that. But I was very pleasantly surprised with the 566 megawatts we signed for 2018 this past quarter, and my expectation is that that number in 2018 will continue to go up, just as it has in the past, just because wind has a shorter timeframe.
Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Is it fair to say that's kind of the higher half or the upper half of the range is still achievable for 2017 to 2018?
Armando Pimentel - NextEra Energy, Inc.: You know, it's – I think though, I think honestly all of the numbers in that range are achievable. And if all I wanted to do was to meet the higher end of the range on wind for 2017 and 2018, we could probably do that, but that's not necessarily always the right thing to do, right? I mean, you may be talking customers into building something in 2019 and 2020, because it's better economics for us honestly, than it could be for 2018. So every situation is different. Again, I'm happy at this point that we've signed almost 900 megawatts for 2019 and 2020, and that we still have a pretty decent backlog of 2018 opportunities that we have been shortlisted on.
Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. That's helpful color. And then maybe, John or Jim, given the stock performance has been as strong as it has year-to-date, just kind of maybe going back to an earlier question on cash return versus dividend or incremental investment opportunities versus buybacks. Does the stock performance kind of lower the hurdle to deploy capital into other investments or to return cash to shareholders through a bigger dividend increase maybe than previously expected?
James L. Robo - NextEra Energy, Inc.: So Chris, this is Jim. Listen, we remain very disciplined in how we evaluate all our incremental opportunities. We're looking hard at a lot of different things to continue to deploy that excess balance sheet capacity very profitably for us going forward. And that's going to be our focus, but as always, we're not going to do dumb stuff either, we're going to be very disciplined about it. And we'll be – on the dividends, we will be – we just had a discussion with the board about the dividend in October, we'll have another one in December and will be coming out with our post-2018 dividend policy in February once the board finalizes where they're going to come out on that. So, more to come on the dividend.
Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Sounds great. Fair enough. Thanks, guys.
James L. Robo - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.

With that, I will turn the call over to John.
John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners delivered strong financial results in the second quarter, while continuing to execute on the objectives we shared with you at our investor conference last month. At NextEra Energy, adjusted earnings per share grew by more than 11% driven by new investments at both FPL and Energy Resources. At Florida Power & Light, growth was primarily driven by continued investment in the business to further advance our long-term focus on delivering outstanding customer value. Average regulatory capital employed increased by over 10% versus the same quarter last year, reflecting our commitment to invest capital to deliver low bills, high reliability and clean energy solutions for the benefit of our customers. Our major capital initiatives remain on track and I am pleased to report that construction is underway at the eight 74.5-megawatt solar energy centers that are currently being built across FPL service territory under the solar base rate adjustment or SoBRA mechanism of the rate case settlement agreement. FPL also continues to work hard to provide outstanding customer service and was recently named one of the 2017 most trusted brands according to a nationwide study conducted by market strategies international. While we always strive to continuously improve, we remain pleased with FPL's financial results and overall execution. At Energy Resources, contributions from growth and our contracted renewables portfolio and investments in natural gas pipelines drove strong financial results for the quarter. We continue the pattern of origination success with which we started the year signing 631 megawatts of additional wind and solar power purchase agreements since our first quarter call. We also successfully negotiated our first PPA amendment for a repowering project, adding approximately 200 megawatts to our repowering backlog. This project helps support the acceleration and expansion of our repowering opportunity set, which was increased to a total expected capital investment of between $2.5 billion and $3 billion over the next four years, while our 2017 and 2018 repowering expectations increased to a range of 2,100 megawatts to 2,600 megawatts. As we outlined last month at our investor conference, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on one of the best environments for renewables development in our history. With continued costs and efficiency improvements in wind and solar technology, economics have become the primary driver of ongoing customer origination activity. A consistent focus on leveraging Energy Resources' competitive advantages, including our development skills, purchasing power, best-in-class construction expertise, resource assessment capabilities and strong access to and cost of capital advantages position us to further advance an already strong and visible opportunity set going forward. Many of these competitive advantages are equally applicable to our natural gas pipeline origination and development activities. Along those lines, I am pleased to announce that during the quarter both the Sabal Trail Transmission and Florida Southeast Connection natural gas pipeline projects successfully achieved commercial operation on budget and on a schedule consistent with our mid-2017 guidance. NextEra Energy Partners grew both adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution by almost 30%, reflecting meaningful growth in NEP's portfolio over the past year. The NEP assets operated well and the strong growth in adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution was consistent with our expectations. The NEP board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.38 per common unit or $1.52 per common unit on an annualized basis, an increase of approximately 15% from a year earlier. During the quarter, NEP completed the acquisition of the roughly 250 megawatt Golden West Wind project from Energy Resources that was announced on our last call, adding to its portfolio of high quality long-term contracted assets. In addition to the modified IDR structure we implemented earlier this year, we believe the changes we announced at NEP last month, including the improved governance structure, the standalone credit rating in the mid to high BB category and the agreement to issue $550 million of convertible preferred units, significantly enhance the LP unitholder value proposition. With clear visibility into future growth and even greater financial flexibility to finance that growth, we believe NEP is well positioned to meet its long-term financial expectations without the need to sell common equity until 2020 at the earliest other than modest sales under the ATM program. We are pleased with the progress we are making at NEE and NEP and heading into the second half of the year, we are well positioned to achieve the full-year financial expectations that we have previously discussed, subject to our usual caveats. Now let's look at the detailed results beginning with FPL. For the second quarter of 2017, FPL reported net income of $526 million, or $1.12 per share, an increase of $78 million and $0.16 per share respectively year-over-year. Net income growth of over 17% versus the prior year comparable quarter was primarily driven by more than 10% growth in regulatory capital employed, the absence of the gas reserve charge that we recorded in the second quarter of 2016, and increased earnings from wholesale operations. Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.5% for the 12 months ending June 2017. We expect the flexibility provided by the utilization of our reserve amortization coupled with our weather normalized sales growth forecast and current CapEx and O&M expectations to support our target regulatory ROE of 11.5% for the full year 2017, which is at the upper end of the allowed band of 9.6% to 11.6% under our current settlement agreement. As a reminder, under the current rate agreement, we record reserve amortization entries to achieve a predetermined regulatory ROE for each trailing 12-month period. We utilized $17 million of reserve amortization during the quarter, which was less than we had planned, in order to achieve the 11.5% ROE that I just mentioned. Over the remainder of 2017, assuming normal weather and operating conditions, we expect to reverse more than half of the $228 million reserve amortization taken year to date and to end the year with a balance roughly $100 million below the $1.25 billion with which we started the settlement agreement. Turning to our development efforts, all of our major capital projects at FPL are progressing well. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $1 billion in the quarter and we expect our full-year capital investments to be between $5 billion and $5.4 billion. Construction on the approximately 1,750 megawatt Okeechobee Clean Energy Center remains on schedule and under budget. As I mentioned earlier, construction is underway at the eight solar projects currently being built across FPL service territory under the SoBRA mechanism, continuing one of the largest solar expansions ever in the eastern U.S. The eight new plants, which will comprise a total of nearly 600 megawatts of combined capacity, are all on track and on budget to begin providing cost effective energy to FPL customers later this year and in early 2018. We are moving through the regulatory process on a number of initiatives that are aimed at strengthening the value proposition that we deliver to our customers. Earlier this month, we completed the first step in the comprehensive review and permitting process for the planned modernization of Lauderdale plant as the Florida Public Service Commission approved FPL's request for bid rule exemption. The roughly 1,200 megawatt highly-efficient, clean-burning natural gas Dania Beach Clean Energy Center is expected to begin operation by mid-2022 and generate more than $350 million in net cost savings for FPL customers. We plan to file a petition for a determination of need for the facility later this fall. The total capital investment for the project is expected to be approximately $900 million through 2022. FPL also filed a petition with the FPSC for approval to shut down the St. Johns River Power Park, an approximately 1,300-megawatt coal-fired plant jointly own with JEA at the end of this year. The early retirement of the plant is projected to save FPL customers $183 million and prevent nearly 5.6 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually. The technical hearing is scheduled for mid-September to review the filing. Following the hearing, we anticipate an agenda conference will be scheduled later in the fall to decide on the proposal. We continue to make good progress on our other capital initiatives, including our ongoing investments to harden and automate our existing transmission and distribution system, and development of the additional 1,600-megawatts of solar projects that are planned for beyond 2018. We have currently secured more than 4 gigawatts of potential sites that support FPL's ongoing solar expansion. All of our efforts at FPL are aimed at further enhancing our already best-in-class customer value proposition. The economy in Florida continues to grow at a healthy pace with the state adding approximately 1,000 new residents per day. Florida's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in June was 4.1%, down 0.8 percentage points from a year earlier, and the lowest since mid-2007. Within the housing sector, the Case-Shiller Index for South Florida shows home prices up 5.2% from the prior year, while mortgage delinquency rates continue to decline and new building permits remain at healthy levels. At the same time, the June reading of Florida's consumer sentiment remained close to post recession highs. FPL's second quarter retail sales increased 0.7%. For the quarter, FPL's average number of customers increased by approximately 64,000 or 1.3% from the comparable prior-year quarter, which was consistent with our long-term expectations. Overall usage was flat as a favorable weather comparison was roughly offset by decline in underlying usage per customer. As you may recall, last year underlying usage was in line with our long-term expectations and, as we have often pointed out, this metric can be somewhat volatile on a quarterly basis, particularly during periods when temperatures deviate significantly from normal as we sometimes experience during the second quarter of each year. Our long-term expectations of underlying usage growth continue to average between 0% and approximately negative 0.5% per year. Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported second quarter 2017 GAAP earnings of $301 million or $0.64 per share. Adjusted earnings for the second quarter were $351 million or $0.74 per share. Energy Resources' contribution to adjusted EPS increased by $0.07 or approximately 10% year-over-year. New investments added $0.17 per share, reflecting continued growth in our contracted renewables program and contributions from our natural gas pipeline development projects. These gains were partially offset by a decline in contributions from our existing generation assets of $0.08 per share. The refueling outage at our Seabrook Station nuclear plant combined with other headwinds was partially offset by favorable wind generation. Overall, wind resource was 101% of the long-term average, up from 93% a year earlier. Our customer supply and trading business contributed a positive $0.05 per share due to favorable market conditions and successful origination activities. All other remaining items contributed negative $0.07, reflecting lower contributions from the company's gas infrastructure business and higher costs associated with a year-over-year increase in interest expense. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide. As I mentioned earlier, the Energy Resources development team had another successful quarter of origination activity, adding 630 megawatts to our contracted renewables backlog since the first quarter call. Let me now spend a minute on where each program stands. Since our last earnings call, we have added 193 megawatts of wind projects and 438 megawatts of new solar projects to our renewables backlog. All of the wind projects and 80 megawatts of the solar projects are for delivery in 2017 and 2018. The accompanying chart updates information we provide on last quarter's call, but our overall expectations have not changed. We continued to track against the total development forecast for 2017 through 2020 that we shared at our investor conference last month, and our backlog continues to track against the assumptions supporting our previously announced financial expectations. Only halfway through 2017, we are pleased to have already signed more than 1,600 megawatts of contracts for 2019 and 2020 delivery which is a reflection of the continued strong economic demand for wind and solar combined with our competitive advantages in renewables development. During the quarter, Energy Resources successfully commissioned an additional 213 megawatts of our wind repowering program and we continue to make solid progress on the remaining sites. As I previously mentioned, since our last earnings call, we added approximately 200 megawatts to our repowering backlog, which now totals roughly 1,800 megawatts. This new opportunity, which is scheduled to be completed in 2018, represents our first wind repowering under an existing power purchase agreement. Our development team is in active negotiations with customers under other existing PPAs to facilitate additional repowering opportunities. As a reminder, at last month's investor conference, we increased our total expected capital deployment for repowerings to between $2.5 billion and $3 billion through 2020, while also accelerating delivery of additional repowering megawatts into 2017 and 2018. For the reasons discussed at our investor conference, we expect to bring into service a total of 10,100 to 16,500 megawatts of renewables from 2017 through 2020, including repowerings. To highlight the scale of this opportunity set, it's worth noting that the midpoint of this range represents more megawatts than Energy Resources' total wind and solar portfolio as of year-end 2014. As I mentioned earlier, in addition to our continued renewables operation success, we're pleased that both Sabal Trail Transmission and Florida Southeast Connection achieved commercial operation during the second quarter, both on budget and in line with the mid-2017 timing that we had previously shared. The Mountain Valley Pipeline continues to progress through the FERC process. Late last month we received the final environmental impact statement which recommended approval of the project to the commission. Assuming a FERC quorum is reestablished, we project a FERC certificate for MBP this fall and will begin advancing construction efforts for December 2018 in-service date. NextEra Energy's expected investment is approximately $1.1 billion. Let me now review the highlights for NEP. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $196 million and cash available for distribution was $84 million, up $40 million and $19 million respectively from the prior year comparable quarter, primarily driven by growth in the underlying portfolio. New projects added $43 million of adjusted EBITDA and $20 million of cash available for distribution. The existing assets in the NEP portfolio operated well and benefited from a year-over-year improvement in wind and solar resource. As a result, adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution from existing projects increased by $6 million from the prior-year comparable quarter. For the NEP portfolio, wind resource was 98% of the long-term average versus 91% in the second quarter of 2016. The improvement in existing assets was roughly offset by higher IDR fees, which increased by $7 million year-over-year. The impact of these and other effects is shown on the accompanying slide. During the quarter, NEP completed the financing and acquisition of the approximately 250 megawatt Golden West Wind Energy Center from Energy Resources that was first announced on our last earnings call, which was funded entirely through NEP's existing debt capacity. NEP's financing flexibility was significantly enhanced by the announcements we made in June. Based on the standalone credit ratings in the mid- to high-BB category that were received last month, NEP expects to target total holdco leverage to project distributions of four to five times over the longer term, which is consistent with its credit ratings. It should be noted that each rating agency makes their own adjustments to our reported financial information, including adjusting expected production at our sites from P-50 to P-90 in some instances, which our target leverage ratio takes into account. Currently, NEP's holdco leverage ratio is approximately three times project distributions after debt service assuming P-50 resource, or approximately 3.3 times assuming P-90 resource and other rating agency adjustments. With the increased leverage capacity provided by the standalone credit ratings, NEP has substantial balance sheet capacity moving forward. We have included a new slide in the appendix to today's presentation with additional details regarding NEP's leverage targets and credit metrics and our year-end expectations against these targets. NEP's financing flexibility is further enhanced by last month's agreement to issue $550 million of convertible preferred units. The convertible preferred securities have a 4.5% coupon for the first three years, the lowest ever in the yieldco or MLP space, and an issuance price of roughly $39.23 which represents a 15% premium to NEP's 45-day volume weighted average price prior to execution of the agreement. Among other attractive features, the coupon can be paid in kind with additional preferred units during the first three years. As a result of these efforts to further improve NEP's financing flexibility, we did not expect NEP to need to sell common equity until 2020 at the earliest, other than modest sales under the ATM program. Earlier this month, we filed a Schedule 14C with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which includes forms of updated organizational documents for NextEra Energy Partners, reflecting the governance changes that were announced at last month's investor conference. These governance improvements, among other rights, will give LP unitholders the ability to elect the majority of the NEP board and are expected to further enhance LP unitholder value. As announced in our filings, LP unitholders will have their first opportunity to elect the majority of the NEP board beginning at the 2017 annual meeting of limited partners which is expected to be held in December of this year. A more detailed timeline of the schedule is available in the appendix of today's presentation. As a result of these governance changes, NEE will be required to deconsolidate NEP from its financial statements beginning January 1, 2018. Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy, for the second quarter of 2017, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $793 million, or $1.68 per share. NextEra Energy's 2017 second quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $881 million and $1.86 per share respectively. Adjusted earnings from the Corporate and Other segment decreased $0.04 per share compared to the second quarter of 2016, reflecting the sale of FiberNet earlier this year and other miscellaneous corporate items, none of which was individually notable. NextEra Energy's year-to-date operating cash flow adjusted for the impacts of certain FPL clause recoveries and the Indiantown acquisition increased by roughly 9% compared to 2016, and we continue to maintain our strong financial position and credit profile. As a reminder, through 2020 we expect cash flow from operations to grow in line with our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate of 6% to 8%. Last month we provided financial expectations for NextEra Energy through 2020. For 2017, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share at NextEra Energy to be in the range of $6.35 to $6.85. While we have had a strong first half, we continue to expect to finish 2017 at or near the upper end of our previously disclosed 6% to 8% compound annual growth rate off a 2016 base. Based on what we see now, we expect most of our growth in the second half of the year to be in the fourth quarter. For 2018, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $6.80 to $7.30 and in the range of $7.85 to $8.45 for 2020, implying a compound annual growth rate off a 2016 (27:07) base of 6% to 8%. As I said last month, we believe that we have one of the best growth opportunity sets in our industry and we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our 6% to 8% range through 2020. We continue to expect to grow our dividends per share 12% to 14% per year through at least 2018 off a 2015 base of dividends per share of $3.08. As always, our expectations are subject to the usual caveats, including but not limited to normal weather and operating conditions. Finally, as we announced earlier this month, Energy Future Holdings terminated the agreement and plan a merger with NextEra Energy for the approximately 80% ownership interest in Oncor held by EFIH. As a result of the termination of the agreement EFH is obligated to pay a $275 million termination fee to NextEra under the terms and conditions of the agreement. And we will vigorously pursue our rights with regard to the payment of the fee. Let me now turn to NEP. From a base of our fourth quarter 2016 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $1.41, we continue to see 12% to 15% per-year growth in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2022 subject to our usual caveats. As a result, we expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2017 distribution to be in a range of $1.58 to $1.62 per common unit, meaning the fourth quarter distribution that is payable in February 2018. The December 31, 2017 run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA of $875 million to $975 million and CAFD of $310 million to $340 million are unchanged reflecting calendar year 2018 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at year-end 2017. Our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and are net of anticipated IDR fees, since we treat these as an operating expense. In summary, we continue to believe that NEE and NEP offer some of the best value propositions in the industry. NEP has clear visibility into its long-term growth trajectory and has significant flexibility as to how that growth can be financed with no need to sell common equity until 2020 at the earliest other than modest sales under the ATM program. Combined with its enhanced governance, the IDRP modification announced earlier this year and stable cash flows supported by a portfolio of assets with an average contract life of 18 years and an average counterparty credit rating of A3, we believe NEP offers a superior investor value proposition when compared against high quality dropdown MLPs and other yieldcos. At NextEra Energy, we have a long-term track record of delivering results for shareholders and remain intensely focused on achieving our strategic growth and growth initiatives going forward. NEE has one of the strongest credit ratings and balance sheets in the sector backed by a largely rate-regulated and long-term contracted asset portfolio and $3 billion to $5 billion of excess balance sheet capacity. FPL benefits from a constructive regulatory environment with four years of rate predictability, while both FPL and Energy Resources stand to gain from one of the best renewables environments in our history with improving equipment costs and efficiencies and expected advancements in energy storage. Together with $425 million of run rate efficiencies identified across our businesses through Project Accelerate and a strong pipeline of backlog with many incremental investment opportunities, we believe NextEra Energy is as well positioned as it's ever been to deliver on our financial expectations over the next four years. That concludes our prepared remarks, and with that, we will now open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you. And we will take our first question from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.
Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning.
John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Good morning, Stephen.
Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah. Wanted to first talk about the repowering. I believe this is the first contract that you signed with respect to repowering. Were there any lessons learned in terms of the process you went through in signing the new contract in terms of the time it required or sort of the win-win scenario that you envisioned in terms of the economic benefit of repowering? Any sort of commentary you can provide around the signing of that contract?
John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Yeah. I'll refer that question to Armando.
Armando Pimentel - NextEra Energy Resources, LLC: Hey, good morning, Stephen. Not really, each one of these are going to be different with a different customer. Each one of the customers has a different timeline, I can tell you that we are in discussions with a number of customers and all of them, I would say virtually all of them, are responding favorably to the economics about picking up some additional megawatts. So, but each one of these are different, right? The customer's in a different place and their regulatory environment and what their needs are. But we continue to feel really positive that we're going to pick up what we said we would at the investor conference in terms of additional megawatts under the repowering program. I think this is one of those situations where it's really good for those customers that have those long-term contracts and it's really good economics for us.
Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. That's helpful. And just stepping back and thinking about renewables acquisition opportunities, it appears there's no shortage of renewables assets that are available for purchase out in the market. But I know generally you've had just excellent organic returns on your development profile. When you think about the prospects for acquiring renewables assets out in the market versus your own organic growth opportunities, is it fair to say you're still fairly heavily biased towards your own organic growth or do you think that there is some potential to be able to win in a competitive situation and acquire renewable assets in the market?
Armando Pimentel - NextEra Energy Resources, LLC: Well, Stephen, the first thing I will say is, we're always looking, right, the assumption should be if there are renewable assets for sale out there in the market, the expectation of our investors should be that we're taking a look. We haven't been, as you noted, as successful in the larger type of acquisitions that draw a lot of folks to the table, but that doesn't mean that there may not be something unique about the ones that are out in the market right now that might put us in a better position. We continue to be very active in the asset acquisition market. It really doesn't get a lot of headlines. So these are projects that may not be necessarily 100% greenfield, but these are smaller projects, one-off projects that smaller developers either have land or have permits or may have an interconnect and so on that we are actively looking in the area and that we pick up and those don't necessarily make a splash anywhere in the media, but those are situations that we continue to be very active in. You're right, it is a time where there are larger assets available out there, larger portfolios and the assumption is that we're taking a look and if it makes sense, that either at NEE or at NEP, that we would be in a position to be a buyer.
Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's helpful. So it sounds like, Armando, the less cookie cutter it is, the more – if it has some unique elements, then maybe there's a better chance versus if it's a very standard type of asset where you could have a lot of bidders, that would be less likely for you all to be successful there.
Armando Pimentel - NextEra Energy Resources, LLC: That's correct, Stephen and that is really no different than where we've been.
Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Very good. Thank you very much.
John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Stephen.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI.
Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Great quarter.
John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Good morning, Greg. Thank you.
Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI: Two very, very sort of modest questions. One was that can you tell us what the quarter-over-quarter improvement was in marketing and trading and retail? It was a nickel improvement. And then also if I go to the appendix, there was a very modest change, a $25 million reduction in the guidance range for contracted renewables. And is that just sort of rounding error or did something meaningful happen in terms of a near-term outlook for certain assets in that portfolio?
John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Yeah. On the latter question, really just rounding error there. I mean, given the size of the build, just a very small change. I mean, I think it was just $25 million and that's rounding error. And on the first question, where did the contribution come from the training and marketing business? I mean it was really through improvements and full requirements and then some origination activity on some of the customer facing business within that portfolio.
Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI: Okay. Thank you. Have a great day.
John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.
Eugene Hennelly - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Hi. Good morning, everyone. This is actually Eugene Hennelly on for Shar. Sort of a quick question. I was wondering on – you touched on the termination fee that you were pursuing with Energy Future Holdings. Just wondering if you could remind us what the status of that was and maybe in light of the petition filed in Texas to kind of review the order denying the proposed acquisition there.
John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Yeah. So, first of all, the agreement has been terminated by EFH. It was terminated in that the burdensome conditions had not been satisfied, which were one of the precursors to obtaining regulatory approval and if the burdensome conditions had not been satisfied, one of the burdensome conditions being that we would not have to accept an independent board, that would trigger payment of the $275 million termination fee.
Eugene Hennelly - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And then the petition to review the PUCT denial, any way associated with it or still kind of pursuing Oncor, any avenues that are open there?
John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: No, I think the petition that we filed speaks for itself. I'll probably...
Eugene Hennelly - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Okay.
John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: ...just leave it at that.
Eugene Hennelly - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.
Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, guys. Two questions. Jim, Armando, how are you guys thinking about the market impact for solar, if the Suniva tariff-related case kind of keeps progressing and we actually see the United States government put tariffs on imported solar related products? How are you thinking about the big picture impact, what it means for solar new builds? What it means for demand from your customers who want utility scale solar? How are you just kind of thinking about how this kind of shakes through the value chain?
James L. Robo - NextEra Energy, Inc.: So Michael, this is Jim. We'll see what happens on that case. Obviously we're following it closely. My own view on this is that markets adjusts and this is a very competitive market out there for manufacturing panels, that the panel manufacturers are not going to abandon this market and they'll figure out a way to compete. And it may take a little bit, but fundamentally I'm not worried about the long-term implications of whatever happens with the ITC there.
Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. And then kind of a near-term question next, two to three years. You saw in the quarter and we've seen for a bit that you've managed O&M costs at FP&L down and done so successfully. And you talked a little bit about cost savings opportunities at NEER as well, although I don't know if we've actually seen that. When do you expect that to really kind of trickle in? And does that – do you expect actual O&M at NEER to be down or just not to be up as much as it otherwise would've been because you're still adding a lot of megawatts there?
John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Yeah, I think one of the things that we laid out at the investor conference was the run rate savings that we saw coming from Project Accelerate being about $425 million roughly by the time you get to 2019. You can think about that being a 60% FPL, 40% Energy Resources. And as we stair-step into those savings opportunities, you'll see those realized over time for the balance of 2017, mainly in 2018, until we get to that run rate number in 2019.
Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Congratulations on a solid quarter.
Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Do you have any read-through on DC and Rick Perry's report and when that could come out and any expectations of what will be in it?
James L. Robo - NextEra Energy, Inc.: So Paul, this is Jim. I think we will see. I think it's – obviously there's been some press about drafts of that report. I think it's honestly too soon to speculate on what's going to be in there. I think the – and Joe Kelliher actually testified in front of Congress last week around this whole issue of are there reliability issues as a result of the changes that have happened in terms of low natural gas prices and more renewables on the grid. And I think the data is pretty clear. There's no reliability issues on the grid. And, there is plenty of capacity there, and the grid is very resilient. I think you saw, actually last week Andy Ott from PJM saying renewables were very helpful during the polar vortex and that they're a part of the reliability solution, not only part of the problem. And so I feel very confident that the facts are that the grid is extraordinarily reliable as it is right now in America, and that renewables and storage are only going to make it – particularly combined with storage as storage prices come down, are only going to make it more reliable going forward. And as I said at our investor conference, I think the industry has a choice. The industry has a choice of hang onto the past and the technologies of the past or adopting and embracing the technology of the future. And we know what we're going to do and we know what our strategy is and that is to embrace the future and to embrace it wholeheartedly.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you. And then just on the renewables side, your customer mix, how is that evolving from RPS to the Amazons and Googles of the world, and what does that trajectory look like over the next five years in your view?
Armando Pimentel - NextEra Energy Resources, LLC: Hey, Paul, it's Armando. I think it's evolving a bit. Clearly, right, as a C&I market, we see much more activity out there now than we did just a couple of years ago. And if we were to look at the amount of bids that we're getting in and what we're responding to compared to a couple years ago, you certainly see a lot more of the C&I customers that are in there. So, and that's all positive, I think. It's positive for the entire market, and I think it's positive for us. Those contracts, those commercial negotiations are bit different than the ones that we've had in the past, but it's all good and I think it's going to evolve to a good place. I think most important is that when – we laid this out at the investor conference is, it's really only a small number or small amount of the overall power market at this point that is powered by renewable energy, right? I mean, there's a long way to go and whether it's the C&I sector, whether it's the munis and co-ops that are making the evolutionary change that Jim talked about, or even the traditional utility customers, there's a long way to go. And everybody is talking about it. When I go and talk to C&I customers or the munis and co-ops or the traditional utilities, those discussions are all about how they can change their systems to have more renewables and everybody's really positive about it. And so we continue to be really positive about the fact that it's a very low penetration in the market of renewables and it's got a long way to go, and I think the C&I sector, entering into it is really good for us and really good for the market.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Are there notable differences in project returns depending on what type of customer it is?
Armando Pimentel - NextEra Energy Resources, LLC: No. No. There's no notable difference.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you very much. Okay. Appreciate it. Thank you.
Operator: We'll go now to Chris Turnure with JPMorgan.
Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Good morning. You mentioned in the prepared remarks, John, that the second quarter tends to be a little bit difficult to forecast on per customer load growth or per customer usage, but we've seen two quarters now of pretty negative numbers there. Any differences between your expectations in the first half of the year going in and kind of where things have panned out so far or differences between maybe the evolution of the Florida customer and usage there versus other states?
John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, we continue to see strong underlying growth in the Florida economy. Customer growth has been right around our expectations, 64,000, 65,000 a quarter, about 1.3% growth this quarter and what we typically see in the shoulder months, particularly the second quarter of many years, it's just a lot of volatility, because the comparison set is not entirely accurate. Sometimes it can be really, really hot and sometimes it can be a little cooler than normal and we had one of those quarters that was a little bit warmer than usual which makes it difficult to get a really accurate comparison. And so that's really what we're getting at. We have made the adjustment of zero to negative 50 basis points on underlying usage. It's something that we'll continue to watch. Weather related usage I think was up about 2.9%, underlying down about 2.9% and so the offset was really just the usage from the customer growth. But, it's something that we'll continue to watch. But again, it's very hard to draw any accurate conclusions from what we see in the second quarter.
Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC: All right. And just to clarify that negative 50 basis points to zero long-term growth was per customer usage or overall normalized low sort of underlying guidance?
John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Yeah. That is our weather normalized usage impact. So, when you look at underlying usage the impacts of higher efficiency air-conditioning, LED light bulbs, those types of things, we've been anticipating about a zero to a negative 50 basis point impact.
Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And so that number does include the positive impact of customer growth as well?
John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: No.
Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay.
John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: That's the offset against that.
Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Got you. And then, my second question is a little bit longer-term. You've obviously had success on a couple large midstream projects so far. But when you look out into the future, I think at the Analyst Day it was mentioned those will continue to be in your sights. What is the risk and return differential there versus your existing renewable and utility portfolio, whether we're talking about an individual project that you might do in the future or a portfolio of assets?
John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Well, we'd like to be able to find an additional greenfield development project opportunity on the pipeline side, which is what we said at the investor conference. Hopefully over the next four years, by the end of 2020, be able to have one in our line of sights. And the reasons that we say that is all the things that make us a successful renewables developer translate equally over to natural gas pipelines. I mean, we're great at the state regulatory side, we're great on the land acquisition side. We've got an equipment procurement advantage. We have a cost of capital advantage, an access to capital advantage. All those things, particularly when you look at where our cost of capital is against compared to the yield of other MLPs should give us a real advantage to be able to be successful in that business. All that being said, the greenfield pipeline business is very, very competitive and while we will continue to look for gas basis dislocations that can support the economics for a new pipeline project and be able to execute, move forward on one, they're tough to find. And so, that's something that we'll continue to try to identify through our development efforts.
James L. Robo - NextEra Energy, Inc.: So Chris, this is Jim. The only thing I'd add to that is, I think John's absolutely right on the greenfield front, but we have four or five expansion/bolt-on opportunities that we are running very hard at that are in some way associated with our three existing – with the two existing pipeline systems that we're building out at NEE and the one existing pipeline system that is at NEP. And I'm actually quite excited. Just was with our team a few weeks ago, quite excited about some of the opportunities there. And I think in terms of returns there, the returns there would be just as attractive as our renewable portfolio.
Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And then this is probably a good problem to have, but does at any point the magnitude of midstream development opportunities get too big given the level of risk that would be brought on there?
John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: No, because remember the kind of opportunities that we're going to be looking for long-term average contract life with strong on counterparty credits, which is a match against our renewables portfolio.
Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. That's very helpful.
John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Yeah. We view those as a very complementary fit with the rest of our assets.
Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks.
John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Thanks, Chris.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning, guys.
John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Good morning, John, and how are you?
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good. Thank you. Could I just clarify – we kind of didn't quite catch the comment on the upper end. I want to be clear that you're saying you expect to be at the upper end on 2017 as well as 2020 and when you say 2017, are we talking about the guidance or the growth rate or both?
John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: We're talking about the growth rate, the 6% to 8%. We expect to be at the top end for 2017. We'd be disappointed to not be at the top end through 2020. Remember at the investor conference, we did lay out financial plans for both FPL and for Energy Resources. The FPL financial plan had us growing regulatory capital employed at about 8% and net income at right around 9% and the Energy Resources plan had us growing EPS at roughly 11%. Now there's a little bit of an offset for some interest expense on the C&O side, but what we're establishing at the investor conferences, we have a lot of headroom to get to the top end of the range, a lot of cushion to be able to withstand some unexpected events that may come up over the next four years.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And just to make – so the base for 2016 is $6.19, is that correct? When you talk about the earnings.
John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Yeah, the base for 2016 is $6.19. That's right.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. So, that upper end of the growth rate would not be consistent with upper end of the guidance on 2017. I just want to make sure we're understanding that right.
John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: That's right. Remember, when we say upper end, we mean upper end of the growth rate, not the guidance range.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay.
John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: So, we're talking compound annual growth rate of 6% to 8% off a 2016 base of $6.19 a share through 2020.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then, I just wanted to return to just the growth question that Chris brought up. You've typically given the 12-month trailing usage number and if Q2 isn't that meaningful, is that a number you can share? It seemed not to be on the slide.
John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: I'm sorry, Jon. Can you repeat the question?
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: The customer usage number that...
John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Yeah.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: ...you've typically give a 12-month annualized column there which is not there in the slide today.
John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Yeah.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: What's the usage tracking at on an annualized basis?
John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: No we – yeah we typically do that in the fourth quarter. We'll show it for the full year, but we don't typically do that on a quarterly basis.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Oh, okay. It was kind of there last quarter, so I thought maybe that was something you – we'll try and back into it, I guess. Well, thank you.
John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Yeah, the reason we showed it last year was the first quarter of the year comparing against the last 12 months on usage trends.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you.
John W. Ketchum - NextEra Energy, Inc.: You're welcome. Thanks, Jonathan.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Cindy Motz with Williams Capital Group.
Cynthia Motz - The Williams Capital Group LP: Oh, hi. Thanks for taking the question. Most of my questions have been answered, but just on NEP, in terms of their revenues, they were pretty much in line overall with what I was expecting and renewables were a little higher. The pipeline was just a tad lower. And I was just wondering if anything was going on with the operation and maintenance expense. It was just a bit off, just was curious about that. And then just secondly, Armando, you guys talked a lot about storage and you've already talked about acquisitions and everything like that and looking at everything, but just any color you could give us in terms of how you're working with storage and what you see like with you guys working with your competitive advantages there. Thanks.
Armando Pimentel - NextEra Energy Resources, LLC: So, Cindy, no big reason for the revenue on the pipeline to be a little lower. We have moved some of the CapEx on the NET pipes back a little bit from where we had it in our original expectations, but we – I just actually did a review yesterday. We feel really good about the opportunities at those pipes that are sitting down at NEP. We have CapEx opportunities that we're looking at now that are higher even than when we did the acquisition, so we feel good about those pipeline opportunities, but there's no single thing there that I would call out. In terms of storage, my overall comment on storage is fairly consistent with what we talked about at the investor conference and that is that in virtually all circumstances where we are having discussions with customers right now on the solar side, we are also having a discussion about storage. I would say it's just a little less on wind, but not that much less. Everyone is interested in storage. The prices that we're seeing for renewables at this point without storage I think are very competitive with what we're seeing with traditional resources out in the market and we're offering long-term contracts. And so folks are interested in what can you do for me for two, three, four hours of storage? We're having a lot of discussions about the technology with customers. We have a head start compared to our customers and so they're very active discussions. And again, my expectation would be that later on in this decade but particularly early part of next decade that we are going to see storage associated with most of the renewable opportunities out there. I think it's that good, based on what we're seeing on the cost side.
Cynthia Motz - The Williams Capital Group LP: Great. Thanks.
Operator: And our next question will be from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. 
James L. Robo - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Steve, this is Jim. We remain very engaged on that topic and have been speaking with senators on both sides of the aisle and impressing upon them how important it is for infrastructure, continued growth in infrastructure projects in the country to get a vote. Leader McConnell has extended by a couple weeks the time that the Senate plans to be in session in August. That was a positive in terms of being able to get a vote on the nominees prior to August recess. We remain very focused on stressing how important that is to folks on both sides of the aisle and we remain hopeful. Obviously there are some larger dynamics going on. I wish getting a FERC quorum was number one on the hit parade in terms of what Congress is focused on right now, but they're focused on some other things obviously. So, as far as Mountain Valley timing is concerned, it's pretty important that we get that FERC certificate by the end of September in order to continue on the timeline that we have and so we're watching it very closely. 
James L. Robo - NextEra Energy, Inc.: Sure. So, we've talked, I've said about any M&A that it has to be strategic. It has to be significantly accretive. We have to see a clear path to getting it approved. When it comes to a big midstream acquisition, I think – and I think the other thing just the other – the criteria that we laid out for M&A was that we would do nothing that would impair the credit rating. And so any big midstream acquisition I think certainly would not be credit neutral. And so it's not been a big focus of ours frankly, and I'll probably leave it at that. In the yieldco space, we, as Armando said, as assets come available in that space, we will look both at NEE and NEP. And again, we're going to always hold those deals up against our own origination efforts and our own ability to grow NEP on a standalone basis as well. So that's a (01:03:58). That said, we have obviously some real advantages in the yieldco space in terms of synergies and I believe we'd be able to operate the assets better. And so there are some things that could offset some of the headwinds that you'd see from buying big asset portfolios. But we remain very focused on our core strategy which is continuing to grow FPL and continuing to improve the customer value proposition. And at Energy Resources, continuing to grow what we think is the world's best development business, and continue to grow our own pipeline, expand our own long-term contracted pipeline opportunities there. And at NEP, to continue to make it the best. We think it is the best, certainly is the best yieldco in the space and we're very confident that even when you compare it against high-growth MLPs that NEP is extremely well positioned there as well and is going to continue to grow and be a terrific value proposition for our unit holders. And so we have a lot of just core execution that we're focused on. We feel really good about the future and as I said at the investor conference, we don't have to do M&A. It's going to be opportunistic if we do and it really has to make sense and it has to make sense against those four criteria that I laid out earlier. 
Operator: And that concludes the question-and-answer session for today. This now concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, everyone and welcome to the NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. [Indiscernible]. Please go ahead, sir.
Unidentified Company Representative: Thank you, Jane. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining our first quarter 2017 combined earnings conference call for NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. With me this morning are Jim Robo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; John Ketchum, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; Armando Pimentel, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources; and Mark Hickson, Executive Vice President of NextEra Energy, all of whom are also officers of NextEra Energy Partners, as well as Eric Silagy, President and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light Company. John will provide an overview of our results and our executive team will then be available to answer your questions. We will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release, in the comments made during this conference call, in the Risk Factors section of the accompanying presentation or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found on our websites, nexteraenergy.com and nexteraenergypartners.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. Today's presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of certain non-GAAP measures to the closest GAAP financial measure. With that, I will turn the call over to John.
John Ketchum: Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners delivered solid first quarter results and are off to a strong start towards meeting their respective objectives for the year. NextEra Energy’s first-quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 10.1% against the prior year comparable quarter, reflecting strong performance at both Florida Power & Light and Energy Resources. Over the same period, NextEra Energy Partners grew per unit distributions by roughly 15% versus the prior year comparable period. Adding to the solid run rate with which NEP entered the year, we are pleased to announce the acquisition of an additional asset from Energy Resources, which I will discuss in more detail later in the call.  At FPL, earnings per share increased $0.10 from the prior year comparable quarter. Continued investment in the business was the primary driver of growth as regulatory capital employed grew 9.7% year-over-year. With residential build significantly lower than the national and Florida averages, FPL’s focus continues to be on finding smart investments to lower costs, improve reliability and provide clean energy solutions for the benefit of our customers. In addition to the approximately 1750 MW Okeechobee Clean Energy Center, which remains on track and under budget FPL continues to make excellent progress towards its recently announced solar development initiatives. Earlier this month, we filed FPL’s ten-year with the Public Service Commission and announced that we expect to add a total of nearly 2100 MW for solar across Florida over the next several years. We have already secured sites that will potentially support more than 3 GW of FPL’s continued solar growth. We also remain excited about our 50 MW battery storage pilot program that was approved as part of the 2016 base rate settlement agreement, which is expected to complement our solar development efforts. In addition to solar, as part of FPL’s 10-year site plan, we announced our intention to modernize one of FPL’s oldest power plant in the Dania Beach Florida, with a new approximately 1200 MW high efficiency natural gas plant, and to pursue the early phase out of an additional coal-fired plant that we co-own with JEA. FPL was recognized in 2016 for the second consecutive year as being the most reliable electric utility in the nation, as well as for its response to Hurricane Matthew and Hermine. We remain committed to continuously improving our customer value proposition by continuously making investments to harden and automate our existing transmission and distribution system. Not only does FPL offer what we believe is a total customer value proposition that is second to none, but as a result of these initiatives we also expect to continue to deliver shareholder value as regulatory capital employed is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of roughly 8% per year over the four-year term of January 2017 to December 2020. At Energy Resources, adjusted EPS increased by $0.10 per share against the comparable prior year quarter as contributions from new investments continued to drive growth. It was another outstanding period for renewables origination with the addition of 413 MW of wind and 208 MW of solar PPAs added to the backlog this quarter. We also entered into agreements to sell over 1000 MW of wind development rights and new wind projects to one of our largest customers, which we have not previously announced and are not included in our backlog. I will provide more details on our continued origination success later in the call. During the quarter, Energy Resources successfully commissioned the first 114 MW of its wind repowering program and continues to make solid progress on the remaining sites. As a reminder, we have tax equity financing commitments in place for the approximately 1600 MW of repowering projects that we have previously announced. These projects represent around half of the total $2 million to $2.5 million of capital deployment that we expect for repowering through 2020. We continue to actively pursue additional repowering opportunities for our existing contracted portfolio, which will largely comprise the balance of the repowering opportunity in 2018, 2019 and 2020. Beyond renewables, we continue to make good progress on development and construction activities related to our three natural gas pipeline projects and our development team continues to seek new pipeline opportunities going forward. At NextEra Energy Partners, the assets operated well and delivered financial results in line with our expectations. Yesterday the NEP board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.365 per common unit or $1.46 per common unit on an annualized basis continuing our distribution growth at the top end of our range. Inclusive of this increase, NEP has grown its distribution per unit by 95% since the IPO in July of 2014. Further building upon that strength, today we are announcing that NEP has reached an agreement to acquire the approximately 250 MW Golden West Wind Energy Center from Energy Resources. We expect the transaction, which is anticipated to be funded with available debt capacity, to yield a double-digit return to NEP’s unit holders and be accretive to LP distributions. With its extended growth runway, we believe NEP offers a superior value proposition and is better positioned than ever to deliver upon the expectations that we have outlined for our investors. Before continuing with the discussion of our strong results for the quarter, I would like to say a few words about the Oncor transactions. Oncor has always been an opportunistic transaction that we believe leverages our core strength in operating rate regulated utilities efficiently to deliver on our customer value proposition of low bills, high reliability and outstanding customer service. We are disappointed by the recent ruling from the Public Utility Commission of Texas that our proposed transactions are not in the public interest. We expect to file a motion for rehearing with the commission sometime in the next few weeks. However, if we are ultimately unsuccessful with the transactions we continue to believe that we have one of the best growth opportunity sets in our industry and we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top-end of our adjusted EPS growth range of 6% to 8% through 2020 off a 2016 base. We remain laser focused on continuing our long term track record of delivering outstanding results for our shareholders. As a reminder, through the end of 2016 we outperformed both the S&P 500 and the S&P utility index in terms of total shareholder return on a 1,3,5,7 and 10-year basis, and have outperformed more than 70% of S&P 500 over the last 10 years. We were once again honored to be named for the 10th time in 11 years number one in the electric and gas utilities industry on Fortune’s 2017 list of world’s most admired companies, and to be ranked among the top 10 companies worldwide across all industries for innovation, social responsibility and wise use of corporate assets. While third-party acknowledgments are a reflection of our past successes, we remain focused on the future. We expect that the organic growth prospects of both FPL and Energy Resources combined with our continued focus on running our businesses efficiently through initiatives such as our recently announced [project] will allow us to extend our long term track record of delivering value for our customers and providing growth for our shareholders, while we continue to maintain one of the strongest balance sheets and credit positions in the industry. Now let us look at the detailed results, beginning with FPL, for the first quarter of 2017 FPL reported net income of $445 million or $0.95 per share. Earnings per share increased $0.10 or approximately 12% year-over-year. The primary driver of FPL’s earnings growth was continued investment in the business. Average regulatory capital employed grew roughly 9.7% over the same quarter last year. FPL’s capital expenditures were approximately $1.7 billion for the quarter, and we expect our full-year capital investments to be between $5 billion to $5.5 billion. I will discuss FPL’s capital initiatives in more detail in a moment. Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately11.5% for the 12 months ending March 2017. As a reminder, under the new rate agreement we maintain the ability to record reserve amortization entries to achieve a predetermined regulatory ROE for each trailing 12-month period. We began 2017 with a reserve amortization balance of $1.25 billion and used $211 million during the first quarter to achieve the regulatory ROE of 11.5%. As we previously discussed, we expect to use more reserve amortization in the first half of the year given the pattern of our underlying revenues and expenses, and we expect this year to be no different. As you may recall, in 2016 we entered the year with a reserve amortization balance of $263 million and utilized $176 million in the first quarter, but ended the year with a balance of $250 million. The Florida economy continues to show healthy results with recent unemployment rates near their lowest level since 2007. Florida’s consumer confidence level is at post-recession highs. The real estate sector continues to grow with average building permits and the Case-Shiller Index for South Florida up 1.1% and 6.7% respectively versus the prior year. During the quarter, FPL’s average number of customers increased by approximately 65,000 or 1.3% from the comparable prior year quarter, which is generally consistent with our long-term expectations for customer growth. Overall usage per customer decreased 1.4% compared to the prior year. As we have previously noted, usage per customer tends to exhibit significant volatility from quarter-to-quarter, which is more pronounced during periods of abnormal weather conditions similar to those experienced during the first quarter. On a 12 month rolling average, weather normalized customer usage has declined by negative 0.5%, consistent with our long-term expectations averaging between 0% and approximately negative 0.5% per year. However, as a reminder, for the full year 2016 we saw no negative impact from weather normalized customer usage. We will continue to closely monitor customer usage trends going forward. After accounting for these effects and the impact of a leap year day in 2016, first quarter retail sales decreased 1.2% year-over-year. Looking ahead, for 2017, we continue to expect the flexibility provided by the reserve amortization balance coupled with our weather normalized sales growth forecast and current Capex and O&M expectations to support a regulatory ROE towards the upper end of the allowed band of 9.60% to 11.60% under our new rate agreement. As always, our expectations assume among other things, normal weather and operating conditions. Before moving on, let me now take a moment to update you on some of our key capital initiatives, during the first quarter FPL selected the sites for the initial projects being developed under the solar base rate adjustment or SoBRA mechanism of the base rate settlement agreement. The approximately 600 MW of 2017 and 2018 solar is comprised of 874.5 MW sites, which are expected to commence construction this spring with commercial operation expected for half of the sites by year-end 2017 and the remainder in the first quarter of 2018. As a reminder, under the SoBRA FPL is permitted to petition for recovery of up to 300 MW of cost-effective solar to be placed in service each year through 2020, and if approved immediately begin recovering the cost of these projects through rates upon commercial operation. By selecting optimal sites on FPL’s transmission system and leveraging the company’s industry-leading construction, sourcing and development capabilities these projects are expected to produce millions of dollars of net lifetime savings for customers, and will help to further diversify FPL’s fuel mix. We continue to develop sites for the approximately 600 MW of solar capacity planned for 2019 and 2020 under the SoBRA and will work to advance the additional 900 MW of solar that is included in our 10-year site plan over the next several years. As part of the new 10-year site plan, FPL also announced its intention to further modernize the Lauderdale plant and Dania Beach, Florida with a new approximately 1200 MW high-efficiency, natural gas plant that will begin operation by mid-2022. This project, the Dania Beach Clean Energy Center, will help FPL maintain its best in class rank among major US utilities for having the lowest operating to maintenance expenses measured on a cost per kilowatt hour of retail sales. By modernizing a plant that was last updated nearly a quarter century ago with current state of the art technology, FPL customers are expected to save hundreds of millions of dollars in reduce fuel and operating the maintenance cost over its operational life. FPL plans to initiate the public service commission approval process for the modernization in the second quarter. Additionally, earlier this year together with our joint interest owner, JEA, we announced a preliminary agreement to commission the St. Johns River Power Park, a 1252 MW coal-fired plant, in which FPL has a 20% ownership stake. Similar to the Cedar Bay and Indiantown transactions the early closure of the St. Johns plant in 2018, which we intend to see commission approval of this spring, is expected to both reduce costs for FPL customers and significantly reduce emissions. All of our ongoing capital initiatives are aimed at enhancing our overall customer value proposition of delivering low bills, high reliability, outstanding customer service and clean energy solutions for Florida customers. Let me now turn to energy resources, which reported first-quarter 2017 GAAP earnings of $476 million or $1.01 per share. Adjusted earnings for the first quarter were $357 million or $0.76 per share. Energy Resources’ contribution to first quarter adjusted earnings per share increased $0.10 or approximately 15% from the prior year comparable period. New investments added $0.35 per share.  In 2016, we commissioned roughly 2500 MW of new wind and solar projects in the US, which was a record year for Energy Resources. Contributions from new investments and renewables together with the timing of tax incentives on certain projects added $0.31 per share, reflecting strong contributions from these new project additions. New investments in natural gas pipelines added $0.04 per share. Contributions from existing generation assets were essentially flat against the prior year comparable period as was company-wide wind resource. Contributions from our upstream gas infrastructure activities declined by $0.11 per share. As a result of sustained weak commodity prices, in the first quarter of 2016 we elected not to invest capital in drilling certain wells, which resulted in liquidation of [in the money] hedges and the resulting recognition of income. The absence of these hedge liquidations this quarter combined with increased depreciation expense reflecting higher depletion rates were responsible for the year-over-year decline. Mild weather negatively affected our customers’ supply and trading business, where contributions declined by $0.04 per share. All other impacts reduced results by $0.09 per share including the effects of interest expense, reflecting continued growth from the business and share dilution. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide. At Energy Resources, we continue to believe we are well positioned to capitalize on one of the best environments for renewables development in recent history. While state renewable portfolio standards continue to provide strong support for wind and solar growth, customer origination activity continues to be largely driven by economics. Based upon continued equipment efficiency improvements and cost declines, Energy Resources can offer wind PPAs at very competitive prices. Similarly solar is becoming more competitive on a levelized cost of energy basis across the country. We anticipate that improved wind and solar economics and low natural gas prices will continue to lead to additional retirements of coal, nuclear and less fuel-efficient oil and gas-fired generation units, creating significant opportunities for renewables growth going forward. Additionally, over the long term as battery costs decline and efficiencies improve we expect batteries to further complement renewable economics, supporting additional demand as the tax credit stays down in the next decade. As a result, we believe the size of the market potential for new renewables is larger than it has ever been helping to drive growth well into the next decade. I am pleased to report that since the last call we have signed contracts for roughly 413 MW of new wind projects, including 368 MW for post-2018 delivery. We have also signed 208 MW of new solar projects, including 177 MW for post-2018 delivery. These contracts are a reflection of the factors I just mentioned combined with the continued success of our origination efforts as we capitalize on our competitive advantages in both solar and wind. In addition, one of our largest customers is purchasing over 1000 MW of wind projects for self ownership. These projects represent a combination of development asset sales, where our customer finishes development activities and manages construction and build-own transfer opportunities in which Energy Resources turns the project over prior to commercial operation. With our strong internal origination efforts and large pipeline of development projects, Energy Resources has an ability to recycle capital by sometimes selling developed sites to or building projects for others, who may want to own some renewable assets outright. These efforts allow us to optimize our development portfolio and in most cases are expected to help us secure additional PPAs. More importantly the project sales are expected to generate a significant portion of the after-tax MPV per KW that we would realize over the life of a contracted wind project, roughly 20% to 25% of the MPV for development rights sale, and roughly 40% to 50% of the MPV for a build-own-transfer project. Our core business will continue to be to provide long-term contracts to customers. We believe the addressable long-term contracted market remains as strong as ever with cooperatives, municipalities, commercial and industrial customers, and most investor-owned utilities benefited from the scale and other competitive advantages that Energy Resources can provide. The attached chart provides additional details on where our renewables development program now stands for 2017 and beyond. We will give further details on our renewables development program at our investor conference, which we plan to hold on June 22 in New York. The development activities for our natural gas pipeline projects remain on track. Construction on the Florida pipelines is progressing well and we expect an in-service date in the second quarter of this year. As a reminder, NextEra Energy’s investments in Sabal Trail Transmission and Florida Southeast Connection are expected to be roughly $1.5 billion and $550 million respectively. The Mountain Valley Pipeline has continued to progress through the FERC process. We continue to expect to be in a position to receive FERC notice to proceed later this year to support commercial operations by year-end 2018. NextEra Energy's expected investment is roughly $1 billion. Let me now review the highlights for NEP. First quarter adjusted EBITDA was a $170 million and cash available for distribution was $40 million up $29 million and $2 million respectively against the prior year comparable quarter. Overall, results were consistent with our expectations. Portfolio additions over the last year drove growth and adjusted EBITDA of approximately 21%. Adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution from existing projects was roughly flat declining by $2 million against the prior year comparable quarter, primarily as a result of lower wind and solar generation. For the NEP portfolio, wind resource was 99% a long term average versus 100% in the first quarter 2016. Desert Sunlight, which NEP acquired a 24% interest in during the fourth quarter of 2016 provided a minimal contribution to first quarter cash available for distribution growth due to its seasonal generation profile and quarterly debt service payments. Looking ahead, we expect substantial growth and cash available for distribution in the second and third quarters of this year as Desert Sunlight began to making meaningful contributions. When viewed on a run rate basis, which removes the timing impact of acquisitions and their seasonal generation and debt service profiles, annual cash available for distribution grew 18% over the prior year comparable quarter forwarding the growth in LP distributions. As a reminder, these results are net of IDR fees, since we treat these as an operating expense. The impact of other effects, including management fees and outside services are shown on the accompanying slide. We continue to execute on our plan to expand NEP's portfolio and I'm pleased to announce that NEP has reached an agreement with Energy Resources to acquire the Golden West Wind Energy Center. Golden West is an approximately 250 MW wind project in Colorado that entered service in October 2015 and sells 100% of its output under a 25 year PPA. The transaction which is expected to close in early May represents another step to our growing LP unit distributions in a manner consistent with our previously stated expectations of 12% to 15% per year through at least 2022. NEP expects to acquire the Golden West project for total consideration of approximately $238 million, subject to working capital and other adjustments. Plus the assumption of approximately $184 million in liabilities related to tax equity financing. The acquisition is expected to contribute adjusted EBITDA of approximately $53 million to $63 million and cash available for distribution of approximately $22 million to $27 million, each on an annual run rate basis as of December 31, 2017. The purchase price for the transaction is expected to be funded entirely through existing debt capacity and the asset is expected to further enhance the quality and diversity of NEPs existing portfolio while being accretive to LP unit distributions. Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the first quarter of 2017, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $1.583 billion or $3.37 per share. NextEra Energy's 2017 first quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $820 million and a $1.75 per share respectively. Adjusted earnings from the corporate and other segment decrease $0.04 per share compared to the first quarter of 2016 primarily due to the absence of FiberNet and the timing of certain tax items. The sale of FiberNet at 16.7 times 2016 EBITDA, generated net cash proceeds of over a $1.1 billion and a net after-tax gain on disposition of approximately $685 million, that is excluded from NextEra Energy's first quarter adjusted earnings. NextEra Energy's operating cash flow adjusted for the impacts of certain FPL cost recoveries in the Indiantown acquisition increased by over 10% year-over-year. Based on our first quarter performance at NextEra Energy, we remain comfortable with the expectations we have previously discussed for the full-year. For 2017, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share at NextEra Energy to be in the range of $6.35 to $6.85, and at or near the upper end of our previously disclosed 6% to 8% growth rate of 2016 base. As part of the financing for Oncor, NextEra entered into equity forward transactions for 12 million shares which would provide approximately $1.5 billion in proceeds. Given that we do not have a current need for the equity, we intent to settle the forward contract shortly in an orderly manner. We continue to expect adjusted earnings per share in the range of $6.80 to $7.30 for 2018, and for NextEra Energy's compound annual growth rate and adjusted EPS to be in the range of 6% to 8% through 2020 off of 2016 base while maintaining our strong credit ratings. We also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share 12% to 14% per year for at least 2018 off of 2015 base of dividends per share of $3.08. As always, our expectations discussed throughout today's call are subject to the usual caveats including but not limited a normal weather and operating conditions. Turning now to NEP. At NEP, as I mentioned earlier, yesterday the NEP board declared a quarterly distribution of $36.05 per common unit or $1.46 per common unit on an annualized basis representing a 15% increase over the comparable distribution a year earlier. Our expectations for December 31, 2017 run rate adjusted EBITDA and CAFD are unchanged at $875 million to $975 million and $310 million to $340 million respectively. These expectations are subject to our normal caveats and our net of expected IDR fees since we treat these as an operating expense. From a base of our fourth quarter 2016 distribution per common unit and an annualized rate of $1.41, we continue to see 12% to 15% per year growth and LP distributions as be in a reasonable range of expectations for at least 2022, subject to our usual caveats. As a result, we expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2017 distribution that is payable in February 2018 to be in the range of a $1.58 to a $1.62 per common unit. We continue to expect NextEra Energy Partners to achieve its distribution growth targets without issuing common equity for 2017 and potentially 2018. In summary, we remain as enthusiastic as ever about our future prospects. FPL energy resources and NEP all have an outstanding set of opportunities across the board, now we are off to a strong start to 2017 as we continue to execute well against all of our strategic and growth initiatives. At FPL, we continue to focus on operational cost effectiveness productivity and making smart long term investments to further improve the quality, reliability, and efficiency of everything we do. Energy resources maintain significant competitive advantages to capitalize on the expanding market for renewables development and is continuing to make strong progress on its natural gas pipeline development and construction efforts. For NEP, growth in the North American renewables market and the originations success and energy resources continue to expand the pipeline of potential dropdown assets and it's long term growth prospects remain stronger than ever providing benefits for both NEE and NEP. We remain intensely focused on executing on these opportunities and extending our long term track record of delivering value to shareholders. With that, we will now open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.
Stephen Byrd: Hi, good morning and congratulations on good results.
John Ketchum: Thank you, Stephen.
Stephen Byrd: I wanted to explore the notion for rehearing in Texas and I wondered if you could just speak to what the process might look like and then I guess at the core of it, what I'm thinking about are the conditions that were set out it seem very challenging and probably really don’t set a good press in for our industry. How could those potentially be addressed through this process?
John Ketchum: Steve, I might differ that question to Jim.
Jim Robo: So, Steve, just from a process standpoints and I'll get the days pretty close, I think we have 25 days from when the final order went out to file through rehearing the commission then have 30 days to roll on that. They can extend it for a bit should they choose to. And so, that's the kind of process that you're looking at in terms of timing. I think in terms of, obviously we were disappointed in the decision we think we would be a terrific owner of Oncor for the state and for its customers. I think we would add enormous value to customers in Texas from how we would operate the utility. So, in terms of anything else, I think I guess the other two things I would say is obviously we can't pay $18.7 billion for utility that we can't run. And we can't control the board and we can't have access to dividends. And it's just bad business to do anything other than that. And so, you can expect that we will not be accepting any conditions that would not allow us to point the majority of the board or have access to the dividends. I mean, that's just we've been very clear about that from the beginning on this transaction and we continue to be very clear on it. And so, we remain very committed to trying to get it done and as I said we'll be filing for a rehearing here shortly.
Stephen Byrd: Understood. And then if I could shift gears over to wind, we're certainly really encouraged by wind economic improvements. Just looking out a bit further than maybe we typically do. When you think about the changes to wind turbine technology the next generation of blades and turbines, what's the approximate timing for the next generation and how should we think about potential step changes and improvements even further in terms of wind economics and what does to your addressable market?
John Ketchum: Yes. I think from a wind step change standpoint, we had commented on the last call that we expect wind to be about a $0.02 to a $0.03 product without tax credits, early in the next decade. And we get comfortable with that largely because of the step change and the improved economics that we see with wind turbines. First of all, we're expecting even a taller tower design, wider rotor diameters, towers getting to about 90 meters, rotors up close to a 130 meters which could drive the NCF to right around 60%. You combine now with what we expect to be continued progressive reductions and turbine equipment pricing, which we think we'll get even more aggressive as the PTC phase is down. That's how we really get comfortable with that market. And then when you think about the production tax credit, actually facing down right around 2023, we continue to be optimistic about what we see on batteries. We have 20 people dedicated to our battery development effort, we're investing upwards of a $100 million a year in batteries, we're excited about the 50MV battery storage pilot program that FPL has. But imagine the game changer that that would be for renewables, not only wind, that blows predominantly during the in the peak shaving economic opportunities around solar. That could really also help to substantially drive renewable economics. Granted battery still have a long way to go, they're still expensive, still inefficient, but with all the investment from the automotive industry, the focus that you're seeing from our sector, we obviously want to be a leader. The Chinese have announced that they plan to take a major role in battery manufacturing which is one of the factors that really help to drive down the cost curve on PV panels. Those are all things that really make us very optimistic about the prospects for renewables development as we head into the next decade.
Stephen Byrd: That's great color. Thank you, very much.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.
Steve Fleishman: Yes, hi. Two questions. First, I guess this was for Jim. Obviously you are pursuing we're hearing on Oncor, but assuming that that doesn't work out and you're kind of in the standalone case which it sounds like you're thinking you could hit the upper end of your growth rate. Kind of how important is looking at other M&A in the future. I have some investors who say you strategically you guys need to do a deal, could you just kind of give your view on that?
Jim Robo: Sure, Steve. So, I think John said on the call, excluding Oncor, we'd be disappointed if we didn’t earn at the top end of the 6% to 8% range through 2020 from an EPS standpoint. And we're very comfortable with that, we're very comfortable with our organic growth prospects. We do not have to do anything. I love our standalone prospects, I love our two businesses, they have tremendous opportunity to deliver growth for shareholders and also tremendous opportunity to do good things for customers. And so, I love our two businesses on a standalone basis. M&A is hard. I think we've seen in the last month in our industry how hard it is and any -- our perspective of M&A really hasn’t changed for a very long time, which is it's that anything that we would do if we were to do something would have to be really compelling for shareholders. As I said, it's very hard to do. And we're all as always we're going to stay disciplined and let me just reinforce again, we don’t have to do anything on the M&A front because we really do love our standalone organic growth prospects.
Steve Fleishman: Okay, good. And then on the just a question on renewables. So, if you look at the your '17 to '18 development targets, you still have a decent amount to fill in to get to your kind of current expectations. Could you just give color how you're feeling about getting to that?
Armando Pimentel: Hi Steve, I'm Armando. We feel good or we would have obviously changed the numbers. There is I think we said at the last call that there was a lot of activity really through the four years for wind from '17 through '20 and honestly there is a lot of activity in the market right now for solar from '18 to '21. So, we continue to see folks that are interested and bring in renewables and in '18, even if the price maybe a little bit higher for them, they understand that but for their own reasons, whether its commercial and industrial folks that have something internally to get done or whether its folks on the utility broadly define the utility space that have made commitments to regulate us or others, they're interested in '18. So, I don’t know ultimately how it will work out, but we looked at it again this quarter based on the activity that we have in-house and what we know is coming down the pipe. We continue to feel comfortable with the range.
Steve Fleishman: Great, thank you.
Armando Pimentel: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI.
Greg Gordon: Thank you, good morning.
Jim Robo: Good morning, Greg.
Greg Gordon: Turning to the utility business. When you talk about the 8% growth rate and using this as sort of the settlement agreement as a benchmark, what's in the capital plan today and what's not. Refresh my memory but I believe and that was approved by the commission allowed up to 300MV a year of solar. But it sounds like you're opportunity set it a lot higher than that. So, what is what are you planning on doing and then some of the new initiatives you've announced like the proposal to knock down and rebuild that gas plants. Can you just give us what's in the baseline and what the opportunity set is?
Jim Robo: Yes, I mean, sure. One is the transmission and distribution, continued storm hardening, the automation effort that we have there. We have the Oak Ridge OB clean energy center opportunity as well. We have the 1200MV of solar or the extra 900MV in a minute that are part of the SoBRA adjustment. We have the 50MV in our battery storage. Opportunity although would have to recover in rates during the next rate case on that. We still have combustion parts improvements that we continue to make to the existing facilities, continue to complete the peak or upgrades that we have talked about previously. And then we have all the opportunities that we laid out in the 10 year side plan which are incremental. First of all, the additional 900MV of solar which we have secured better than 3 gigawatts of sides in Florida for that we like to be able to execute on over the next several years. Obviously, we are in a good position with our surplus amortization balance, and then the Lauderdale opportunity that we announced as well, which would be more of a 20, 22, I think COD that we would pursue there. And then obviously the St. Johns opportunity that I mentioned earlier, we continue to find smart investment opportunities to clean up the emissions profile in Florida and continue to make NextEra Energy and FPL one of the cleanest emission generators of all top 50 power producers in the country. And we'll continue to try to identify further opportunities going forward. But those are the things that really drive that 8% regulatory capital employed growth.
Greg Gordon: Forgive me for following-on up on the solar. If you chose to go ahead and because you have the opportunity and the sites to go build more than what is in the current segment plan. What's the recovery mechanism for that?
Eric Silagy: So, Greg, this is Eric Silagy. So, outside of the rate agreement, if we went ahead and did solar, then we would seek to recover that during the next grade preceding. That would be the mechanism that we would do that. So, we are looking at opportunities and identifying sites. And we'll determine whether or not we want to do that before we go to the next rate preceding or afterwards.
Greg Gordon: Okay.
Jim Robo: And hey Greg, this is Jim. Just one last thing on that. We are going to, you could expect that in the June Investor Conference that we will lay that out with some details, yes.
Greg Gordon: Okay, thanks a lot. Two more quick ones. Just to be clear on when you say you're going to settle the forward sale, I mean you're not issuing the equity?
Jim Robo: That is correct.
Greg Gordon: Okay. And then the numbers were great in the quarter, but you had that $0.11 headwind from upstream gas and you described very clearly why. When I look in the appendix of your release and I looked at the expected EBITDA PTC contribution from upstream and midstream which is 190, the 290 and 95 to 195. Those that guidance is a function of your expectation that you were going to behave this way with regard to those investments, or should we expect that low end or below the low end?
Jim Robo: Yes. Remember Greg, we didn’t add any new projects that really impacted Q1 performance because of economics but we continue to through our development efforts look for further upstream opportunities that would satisfy that forecast that we have outlined in our materials.
Greg Gordon: Okay, great. Thanks, guys.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.
Paul Ridzon: Good morning. Congratulations on the quarter.
Jim Robo: Thanks, Paul. Good morning.
Paul Ridzon: As you look at investment opportunity, you really keeping your own roots across the energy platform. Would you ever look at an LDC?
Jim Robo: Well, a couple of things I'll say about LDC is 1) Is they tend to go up at very high premiums, just hard to make the economics fork on an LDC and then you got to get comfortable with the liability profile associate with an LDC as well.
Paul Ridzon: Thank you. And --.
Jim Robo: They tend to be expensive and we're only interested in doing transactions that create a long term shareholder value.
Paul Ridzon: But on your repowering, is the entire capital program capture 100% of the PTC or I think those pace down to 80?
Jim Robo: I'm sorry, could you repeat the question?
Paul Ridzon: Your capital program fully powering the winter then? Where all those projects did a 100% of the PTC or is the timing?
Jim Robo: Yes. They all get a 100% of the production tax, right, that's correct. The test of the 80, it's an 80-20 test in terms of determining whether or not it's a new turbine to get a 100% of the PTC.
Paul Ridzon: Is that M&A, private rating agencies comfortable enough with the contractiveness of energy resources that it's utility like enough that you don’t need to do any entry down to portfolio?
Armando Pimentel: Yes. We just to be clear, we do not need to do an acquisition to meet the growth prospects and maintain the credit ratings that awe have through our guidance period. Yes.
Jim Robo: Just to be very clear, we will have very strong credit matrix in 2020 even with the growth that we expect out of both FPL and energy resources through 2020.
Paul Ridzon: Great, thank you.
Armando Pimentel: No need to do M&A to rebalance the balance sheet. And I know there's been a lot of investor questions about that. Just to put that to bed, hopefully once and for all.
Paul Ridzon: Very helpful, thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Jerimiah Booream with UBS.
Jerimiah Booream: Hi, good morning. I just wanted to touch on the economics of build on transfer and development rights on the wind side. Obviously you've had a couple of big announcements recently. How does that flow through the income statement and really what's the kind of near term earnings incremental opportunity that we should think about there?
John Ketchum: Yes. I mean, there is two impacts, there is book and cash. We talked a little bit about cash impacts on the call. We said out of these opportunities, they think about them in two ways, one are development right sales which we put the NPV on a kilowatt basis when you compare to a long term contracted new build at about 20% to 25% and then a build on transfer, you get data and an after-tax NPV kilowatt basis, it's probably about 40% to 50% of the NPV of a long term contracted basis. So, that's cash. On the book side, obviously you're going to generate again off those sales in those gains with we don’t think the material and would be reflected in our income statement.
Jerimiah Booream: Okay. And then also just more specifically on the commercial industrial opportunity. I mean, how many of the PPAs that you're signing are really more focused on the CNI sphere going forward versus traditional PPAs?
Armando Pimentel: It's Armando. Just let me go back to the previous question just a second and I'll get to that one too. So, I just want to put it in context. We haven’t updated numbers on our pipeline for wind and solar in a while. And I just want everybody to understand we got a lot of development out there. And when we talked a couple of years ago about how we would potentially doubling the amount of G&A that we put into both the wind and the solar business through 2018 and we're doing that. So, today just in terms of what I call inventory, we've got 10 gigawatts to 12 gigawatts of inventory on its way to 20 gigawatts here in the near future on wind. And we've got about 10 gigawatts of solar that's on its way to 20 here in the near future. So, we got a lot of opportunities out there for projects. So, if once in a while someone's interested in doing some development and it makes sense for us then we've got the inventory to be able to do that. On the CNI side. CNI gets a lot of press and so on. It's still not a giant portion of the market. It's a market that we've looked at, it's a market we played in, it's a market that we've originated. It is a market that we will probably do more of than we've done in the past in certain regions. But it's also a market that doesn't make sense for us in certain regions where folks are looking for very short term contracts in places where we've got to take a significant amount of merchant risk in the term year. So, my expectation is it could be 20% of what we do on a go-forward basis but I think the traditional stuff that we've been doing with the IOU, the muni, the COOPs and so on will continue to be the bulk of that business for us.
Jerimiah Booream: Okay that's great. And then just one last one from me. On the legislation in Florida right now on gas reserves, can you just talk about any kind of stumbling blocks there and what -- any kind of material changes would be versus the previous program?
Eric Silagy: Yes, this is Eric. So, it's we're right now in the midst of the legislative session. And so, there are a number of hurdles for that legislation to clear. And so, it's by no means certain that gas reserves legislation would actually clear both houses. So, at this point I think it's just speculative to try to predict what's going to happen because there's a lot of areas that we need to cover lot of water and is be covered within legislative process at this point.
Jerimiah Booream: Okay, fair enough. Thanks, guys.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.
Jonathan Arnold: Hi, good morning guys.
Jim Robo: Hi, Jonathan.
Jonathan Arnold: This one is to make we together a couple of the names you've already talked about. So, the Xcel model of BOT and some development sales is, do you see the utility market shifting in that direction and this might well was that kind of a one off as you're looking at go forward?
Jim Robo: No, we do not see the market shifting in that direction. And I think that's the point Armando was making just a minute ago. I mean, we continue to see a very strong long term contracted market made up of our typical customers whether its muni's and COOP, CNI. Most investor owned utilities, it is with the build on transfer like we're able to do with Xcel or you could see an opportunity to generate an attractive NPV off of a sale and yet get contracts back from customer who's been a one year largest customers. Those can be attractive situations. But our core business is going to continue to be the long term contracted business. So, when we look out and we'll lay this out at the June Investor Conference. We really see the market continuing the stay at the levels that's been in the past on the long terms contracted opportunity set aside.
Jonathan Arnold: So, your preference is more to stay in that space. I was just curious whether there was sort of a balance sheet angle that with these changing NPV but you have less on sheet tied up, so maybe that would reduce some of the rationale around the Oncor transaction where you certainly portrayed it at the time, is something that will give you the ability that will max your development activities.
Jim Robo: Jonathan. That market and I know it's got a lot of play here recently. But that rate based market, if you go back historically, year-in year-out, I mean, people have been building rate base on the wind side for the last decade. And it's averaged about 15% of the market. Could it go up a little bit, yes, maybe it'll go up a little bit. But it's a small portion of the overall market. And so, we don’t although there were some transactions here recently, at least our view right now is then even if it goes up a little bit, it's just not a significant part of the market and if there are people that are interested and we can help them help us with our inventory, then we might look at the transaction. Why not. John mentioned some economics that are attractive. But I wouldn’t spend honestly that much time thinking about whether would happen during the last three months is turn the market around. The rate base market is just not that large.
Jonathan Arnold: Okay. Then I just want to clarify one thing, you talked about a 1000MV transaction at the beginning. I wasn’t sure that was something a new one that hasn’t yet been announced or why you're referring to the Xcel deal?
Jim Robo: Yes. No, the 1000MV is with is the large customer transaction. We just had not previously announced it, the customer had made announcements about the deal.
Jonathan Arnold: Okay. But we're talking about the one deal, basically this one.
Jim Robo: One deal, that's correct. One deal.
Jonathan Arnold: Alright, thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.
Michael Lapides: Yes guys, just curious, Project Accelerate. Is there any way to quantify what whether the EBITDA or EPS benefits from it would be and which of the businesses kind of more or less impacted by it?
John Ketchum: Yes. I mean, first of all Project Accelerate is an initiative that we've seen on last call, in this will generate several $100 million in run rate savings going forward. We will give more details on it at the June Investor Conference, but it effects all of our businesses. I mean, we are reimagining and all the business at NextEra Energy resources at FPL finding smarter ways to leverage technology and other way other approaches to each of our individual lines. And we will lay that out including EPS impacts from that at the Investor Conference.
Michael Lapides: But when you say several $100 million, meaning on a pretax income run rate eventually or on a discounted cash flow type of view?
John Ketchum: Yes, on a pretax run rate basis going forward.
Michael Lapides: Got it. I mean, that's pretty material on an after-tax basis that would be a pretty material driver of an EPS uptick over time.
John Ketchum: Yes. But remember that Project Accelerate is included in the expectations that we provided.
Michael Lapides: Got it, okay.
Jim Robo: And the other thing Michael, to remember is FPLs roughly 2/3rds of the company and you cannot take the several 100 million -- that 2/3rds of that run rate creates surplus, it doesn't create earnings, okay.
Michael Lapides: Understood.
Jim Robo: And there's got to be very careful about how you think about it from an earning standpoint.
Michael Lapides: Understood. That benefit over time would actually accrue to the customer once you hit the 11/5/11/6 range. Unrelated question. Just curious Jim or Armando for your thoughts on the prospects in the economics of offshore wind in the US?
Jim Robo: So, Michael we have looked at offshore winds, we spent -- I personally spent an enormous amount of time looking at it for a very good customer of ours back when I was running energy resources. And we came away from that effort not being a big fan of offshore wind for several reasons. One is it effectively from a construction standpoint, very hard to get comfortable that you can ever. It strikes me more is a new nuclear than it does of onshore wind in terms of the construction risk you take. It's marine construction, the ONM associated with it is challenged if the seas are high, you can't you have to fly out to fix the turbines as opposed to get in the boat and go up there to do it. There is an enormous number of hurdles that you need to get to. And then you get to the biggest hurdle which is just its bad economics for customers. I mean, we've been very proud that we've done good economic renewables for customers and we think onshore wind and onshore solar and frankly solar in New England will be probably a third of the cost of offshore wind. It is really not good for customers to be doing offshore winds relative to onshore solar or onshore wind. So, to say that we're not fans would be an understatement and I don’t think it's good for customers and frankly I think it's I think it's we certainly wouldn’t do it, we think it's too risky.
Michael Lapides: Got it. Thank you, Jim. Much appreciate it, guys.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2016 Q4  (2017-01-27 00:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. 
 At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the conference over to Amanda Finnis, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
Amanda Finnis: Thank you, Audra. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2016 combined earnings conference call for NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners.
 With me this morning are: Jim Robo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; John Ketchum, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; Armando Pimentel, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources; and Mark Hickson, Executive Vice President of NextEra Energy, all of whom are also officers of NextEra Energy Partners; as well as Eric Silagy, President and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light Company. John will provide an overview of our results and then turn the call over to Jim for closing remarks. Our executive team will then be available to answer your questions.
 We will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release, in the comments made during this conference call, in the Risk Factors section of the accompanying presentation or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found on our websites, nexteraenergy.com and nexteraenergypartners.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements.
 Today's presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of certain non-GAAP measures to the closest GAAP financial measure.
 With that, I'll turn the call over to John. 
John Ketchum: Thank you, Amanda, and good morning, everyone. Both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners were very successful in executing the initiatives we discussed for 2016 and ended the year with excellent results. 
 NextEra Energy extended its long track record of delivering value for shareholders with adjusted earnings per share of $6.19, up 8.4% from 2015. And the team made significant progress in opportunities to continue to drive growth. NextEra Energy Partners grew distributions to $1.41 per unit on an annualized basis, up 15% from the comparable quarterly distribution a year earlier, which was the top end of the range we discussed going into 2016. 
 Let me now take a few moments to summarize additional highlights for 2016 before taking you through the detailed results. At FPL, we were very pleased to reach a fair and balanced outcome in our base rate case while continuing to deliver on our customer value proposition. We were honored to be recognized by Edison Electric Institute for our outstanding leadership in restoring power safely and quickly following Hurricanes Matthew and Hermine. 
 During the year, the Port Everglades Next Generation Clean Energy Center was completed on budget and 2 months ahead of schedule. Roughly 1,600 megawatts of peaking capacity was upgraded with more efficient, advanced combustion turbines. And FPL solar capacity was roughly tripled with the addition of over 1 million newer -- new solar panels that make up approximately 225 megawatts of universal solar. FPL built upon key successes from 2015, delivering its best-ever service reliability performance and was again recognized as being the most reliable electric utility in the nation. At the same time, FPL's typical customer bill has remained well below both state and national averages. We remain committed to our long-standing focus at FPL on operating the business efficiently and reliably for the benefit of customers. And looking ahead, the positives of 2016 position FPL to continue to execute its successful strategy. 
 At Energy Resources, contributions from new investments continue to drive growth, and 2016 was a great year for our development and construction programs. We commissioned roughly 2,500 megawatts of new wind and solar projects in the U.S. during the year, which was a record for Energy Resources and something we believe no other company has ever achieved in the North American renewables industry. 
 Origination performance was also very strong over last year, with the Energy Resources team adding a total of approximately 3,500 megawatts of new renewables projects and repowering opportunities. 
 In addition to executing well on the project backlog and continuing to advance the development pipeline at Energy Resources, we were pleased to receive additional IRS start of construction guidance on the wind PTC in December that was largely consistent with our thinking. We believe that our safe harbor purchases could qualify over 10 gigawatts of wind for 100% of the PTC, subject to completion by the end of 2020 and other applicable criteria and provide Energy Resources with excellent strategic positioning to capitalize on both new wind and repowering opportunities. 
 A consistent focus on leveraging our development skills, together with our purchasing power, best-in-class construction expertise, resource assessment capabilities, strong access to capital and cost of capital advantages, allow us to continue to advance an already strong and visible opportunity set, and in turn, are at the core of our expectations for outstanding growth prospects at both Energy Resources and NEP. 
 NextEra Energy Partners also delivered continued solid execution on its growth objectives. NEP completed 3 acquisitions from Energy Resources that added a total of over 700 megawatts to its portfolio in 2016, while also demonstrating its flexible and opportunistic approach to financing with a combination of debt and equity. Yesterday, the NEP board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.3525 per common unit or $1.41 per common unit on an annualized basis, up 15% from a year earlier. 
 During the year, we announced proposed transactions that would result in NextEra Energy owning 100% of Oncor, as part of an overall plan of reorganization designed to allow Energy Future Holdings to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Bankruptcy court confirmation hearings are currently scheduled to begin on February 14. 
 Separate from the bankruptcy approval process, together with Oncor, we have filed a joint application with the Public Utility Commission of Texas seeking approval of our proposed acquisition. Intervenor testimony was filed 2 weeks ago, staff testimony was filed last week and hearings are scheduled to commence on February 21 of this year. Based on our current targets for completing key milestones and subject to required approvals, we expect the transactions to close in the first half of 2017. 
 We made excellent progress on the financing plan for Oncor. In addition to issuing equity units and completing an equity-forward transaction last year, our overall corporate financing activities have benefited from successful execution on opportunities to recycle capital, including the completed sales of FiberNet, Marcus Hook and Forney and Lamar. The balance of the proceeds for the Oncor transactions are expected to be raised predominantly through debt at capital holdings later this year and the vast majority of this expected debt issuance was hedged several months ago against interest rate volatility. 
 Our financing plan is consistent with maintaining our strong balance sheet and current credit ratings which we are unwilling to compromise.  All in all, 2016 was a terrific year of execution at FPL, Energy Resources and NEP. 
 Now let's look at the detailed results beginning with FPL. For the fourth quarter of 2016, FPL reported net income of $371 million or $0.79 per share, unchanged from its fourth quarter 2015 EPS. For the full year 2016, FPL reported net income of $1.7 billion or $3.71 per share, up $0.08 per share versus 2015. At FPL, we continue investing in new and modernized generation as well as a stronger and smarter grid to further improve the already outstanding efficiency and reliability of our system. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $837 million in the fourth quarter, bringing our full year capital investments to a total of roughly $3.9 billion. Regulatory capital employed grew approximately 8.3% year-over-year. 
 In addition to bringing into service approximately 225 megawatts of universal solar since the last call, FPL also announced the retirement of the Cedar Bay generating plant at the end of the year. Together with our similar plan to phase down another coal-fired power plant, the Indiantown Cogeneration facility, we expect to successfully retire 2 of the highest greenhouse gas-emitting power plants in the state, while also providing customer savings. The FPSC approved the Indiantown transaction last fall, and we closed the acquisition during the first week of January. 
 Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes for the 12 months ended December 2016 will be approximately 11.5%. We ended the third quarter of 2016 with a reserve amortization balance of $230 million. And we added $20 million in the fourth quarter for a total year-end 2016 balance of $250 million. 
 As a reminder, the new 4-year settlement agreement that was approved by the Florida Public Service Commission in November became effective this month and includes the flexibility over the 4-year term to amortize up to $1 billion of depreciation reserve surplus plus the reserve amount remaining under FPL's now expired 2012 rate agreement that I just mentioned of $250 million for a total of roughly $1.25 billion. 
 In 2017, we expect the flexibility provided by this reserve amount, coupled with our weather-normalized sales growth forecast and current CapEx and O&M expectations to support our regulatory ROE towards the upper end of the allowed band of 9.6% to 11.6% under our new rate agreement. As always, our expectations assume, among other things, normal weather and operating conditions. 
 The Florida economy continues to progress well with strong job growth and recent unemployment rates around their lowest level since 2007. The latest data from the real estate sector continued to show new building permits at healthy levels and the Case-Shiller Index for South Florida is up 6.4% from the prior year. Florida's consumer confidence levels remain near post-recession highs. 
 For the fourth quarter, we estimate that milder weather had a negative year-over-year impact on usage per customer of approximately 5.1%, and that Hurricane Matthew had a comparable negative impact of 0.8%. After taking these factors into account, fourth quarter sales increased 0.4% on a weather-normalized basis, which reflects continued customer growth, partially offset by lower underlying usage per customer. 
 For 2016, we estimate that FPL retail sales reflect negative year-over-year impacts of 2.1% from weather and 0.2% from Hurricane Matthew. FPL's 2016 retail sales growth on a weather-normalized basis was 1.5%, which was primarily driven by the impact of continued customer growth. 
 Looking ahead, we expect year-over-year over weather-normalized usage per customer to average between 0 and negative 0.5% per year for the foreseeable future. 
 Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported fourth quarter 2016 GAAP earnings of $360 million or $0.77 per share. Adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter were $191 million or $0.41 per share. Energy Resources contribution to fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share was roughly flat from last year, which primarily reflects strong new investment contributions being offset by lower results from existing generation assets as well as higher G&A and interest expense. 
 Similar to the third quarter, our fourth quarter results include a positive impact related to the contingent earnout liability that was recorded as part of the Texas pipeline acquisition in 2015. As a reminder, the $200 million earnout, which we no longer expect to become payable, was required to be paid if contracts for growth projects on the NET pipeline were signed by December 31, 2016, and if those expansion projects met several precedent conditions. This impact was roughly offset by lower contributions from our upstream gas infrastructure activities due to increased depreciation expense reflecting higher depletion rates. 
 For the full year 2016, Energy Resources reported GAAP earnings of $1.125 billion or $2.41 per share. Adjusted earnings were $1.09 billion or $2.33 per share. Energy Resources full year adjusted earnings per share contribution increased $0.29 or approximately 14% from the prior year comparable period. Growth was driven by strong benefits from continued new additions to our renewables portfolio, which added $0.47 per share. Contributions from new natural gas pipeline investments added $0.16 per share. New investment growth was partially offset by a decline of $0.12 per share and contributions from our existing generation assets, largely due to the ongoing impact of PTC roll-off. 
 Overall, wind resource was 98% of the long-term average in 2016, up from 94% a year earlier. Contributions from our upstream gas infrastructure activities declined by $0.16 per share. Consistent with the expectations we discussed last call, this was primarily driven by the full-year impact of increased depreciation expense reflecting higher depletion rates. This essentially offset the $0.17 per share positive impact from the elimination of the Texas pipeline's contingent earnout liability that I mentioned earlier. All other effects had a negative impact of $0.23 per share, mostly driven by a year-over-year increase in interest expense reflecting continued growth from the business, as well as the effects of share dilution. 
 Finally, as we did last year, we have included a summary in the Appendix to the presentation that compares Energy Resources' adjusted EBITDA by asset category to the ranges we provided in the third quarter of 2015. 
 2016 was an excellent year for our development and construction programs in Energy Resources. As a reminder, our total 2015 to 2016 renewables development program was approximately 4,000 megawatts. This significantly exceeded the original expectations we had shared for this time frame in May 2015 to 2016, the most successful 2-year period for renewables development in our history. 
 Since the last call, we signed additional contracts for roughly 640 megawatts of new projects, including roughly 540 megawatts of wind for 2017 and 28 (sic) [2018] delivery and 100 megawatts of solar for post-2018 delivery. We also continue to aggressively pursue repowering opportunities on the balance of our portfolio to add to the 1,600 megawatts of repowering that we previously announced and continue to see the total opportunity being between $2 to 2 -- between $2 billion to $2.5 billion through 2020. The accompanying slide provides additional detail on where our renewables development program now stands. 
 Our natural gas pipeline projects continue to progress through the development process and remain on track. The Florida pipelines commenced full construction activities in 2016, and we continue to expect an in-service date in the middle of this year. As a reminder, NextEra Energy's investments in Sabal Trail Transmission and Florida Southeast connection are expected to be roughly $1.5 billion and $550 million, respectively. And FPL is the anchor shipper on both pipelines. 
 The Mountain Valley Pipeline continues to progress through the FERC process. We expect the pipeline, with approximately 2 Bcf per day of 20-year firm capacity commitments, to achieve commercial operations by year-end 2018. NextEra Energy's expected investment is roughly $1 billion. 
 Let me now review the highlights for NEP. Fourth quarter 2016 adjusted EBITDA of approximately $168 million increased $33 million from a year earlier. Consistent with NEP's substantial portfolio growth over this time period, strong contributions from new project additions drove results with a relatively modest offset from higher IDR fees. 
 Fourth quarter 2016 CAFD was approximately $68 million. As a reminder, NEP's quarterly CAFD results are impacted by timing of debt service and PAYGO payment. Included within the projects added over the last year, the ceiling 1 and 2, Golden Hills and Cedar Bluff U.S. wind projects, as expected, do not receive PAYGO payments in the fourth quarter. As a result, together with increased interest in corporate expenses due to growth, fourth quarter CAFD declined year-over-year. We ended the year with adjusted EBITDA and CAFD run rates consistent with the expectations we have shared previously for December 31, 2016. For the full year 2016, adjusted EBITDA and CAFD were $639 million and $222 million, respectively. Portfolio growth drove higher year-over-year results while existing assets benefited from a favorable comparison of wind resource. 
 Across the NEP portfolio, overall wind resource was 98% of the long-term average versus 93% in 2015. As a reminder, these results are net of IDR fees, which we treat as an operating expense. IDR fees increased $34 million year-over-year. 
 As I mentioned earlier, NEP completed 3 acquisitions from Energy Resources in 2016, financed with a combination of debt and equity. We have incremental holdco debt capacity of at least $575 million, which continues to provide NEP with substantial flexibility to execute its -- against its future growth prospects. 
 Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the fourth quarter of 2016, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $966 million or $2.06 per share. NextEra Energy's 2016 fourth quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $566 million and $1.21, respectively. 
 For the full year 2016, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $2.912 billion or $6.25 per share. Adjusted earnings were $2.884 billion or $6.19 per share. From the Corporate & Other Segment, adjusted earnings for the full year increased $0.11 per share compared to 2015, primarily due to certain tax items and investment gains. 
 Turning now to our near-term financial expectations for NextEra Energy. We are introducing expectations for 2017 and updating our range for 2018. We expect adjusted earnings per share for NextEra Energy to be in a range of $6.35 to $6.85 for 2017; and are increasing our range for 2018 from $6.60 to $7.10 to $6.80 to $7.30. From a base of our 2016 adjusted EPS of $6.19, the midpoints of these ranges reflect the compound annual growth rate of roughly 7%. Jim will discuss our expectations and longer-term outlook in just a moment. 
 We continue to expect to grow our dividends per share of 12% to 14% per year through at least 2018, off a 2015 base of dividends per share of $3.08. As always, our expectations are subject to the usual caveats, including but not limited to, normal weather and operating conditions. 
 Let me now turn to NEP. At NEP, as I mentioned earlier, yesterday the NEP board declared a fourth quarter distribution of $0.3525 per common unit or $1.41 per common unit on an annualized basis, representing a 15% increase over the comparable distribution a year earlier. Jim will also discuss our long-term outlook for DPU growth at NEP in just a moment. 
 Our December 31, 2016, run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA of $670 million to $760 million and CAFD of $230 million to $290 million are unchanged, reflecting calendar year 2017 expectations for the portfolio with which we ended the year. 
 Our December 31, 2017, run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA of $875 million to $975 million and CAFD of $310 million to $340 million are also unchanged reflecting calendar year 2018 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at year-end December 31, 2017. The midpoint of this CAFD range reflects roughly 25% growth from the comparable CAFD midpoint based on our December 31, 2016, run rate expectations. Our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and are net of expected IDR fees as we expect these fees to be treated as an operating expense. 
 With that, I will turn the call over to Jim to discuss the long-term outlook at NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. 
James Robo: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Our strong performance in 2016 reinforces the overall strength and diversity of our growth prospects. And I remain as enthusiastic as ever about our future. 
 Before providing additional updates on our outstanding long-term outlook at NextEra Energy, I'd like to take a moment to discuss an agreement reached between NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners for a structural modification to NEP's IDR fees. 
 Since the time of its launch, NEP has diversified its portfolio by roughly tripling its renewables capacity and adding 7 natural gas pipeline assets with the acquisition of the Texas pipelines in 2015. NEP has built a high-quality portfolio with high-quality cash flows backed by assets with an average remaining contract life of 18 years and average counterparty credit rating of A3. 
 NEP's most recently declared distribution at an annualized rate of $1.41 per unit reflects cumulative growth of 88% since its 2014 IPO. This exceeds the expectations for growth that we discussed initially in mid-2014 and reflects solid execution in a difficult capital markets environment. 
 NEE offers NEP and its investors high visibility into a large portfolio of attractive long-term contracted assets operated by a best-in-class sponsor and supported by the development capabilities of North America's largest and best renewables developer. We continue to believe that the scale, financial strength, experience and track record of its sponsor are what set NEP apart from other infrastructure alternatives. 
 Conversely, NEP offers NEE the opportunity to highlight the value of Energy Resources' long-term contracted portfolio of assets, while enabling NEE to recycle capital back into its development projects and optimize its tax position by monetizing its deferred tax asset balance against tax gains generated from the sale of assets to NEP. 
 Notwithstanding all of these positives, we believe there's a disconnect right now between NEP's future growth potential and its current valuation. There appear to be, at least, a couple of factors that are adversely affecting NEP's performance. First, capital markets are still recovering from a meaningful reduction in funds flow in the infrastructure space caused by significant declines in commodity prices during the second half of 2015. While conditions are starting to slowly improve, the constrained environment continues to put pressure on high-quality drop-down stories that require equity to achieve growth targets. 
 Second, because NEP has reached the high splits, some investors have expressed concern that NEP's IDRs will consume an increasing share of the incremental cash flow that would otherwise be available to drive LP distribution growth, which could result in the need to drop down more assets and issue more equity at a time when capital markets are constrained. 
 In order to address these concerns, today, we're announcing that the NEP board has approved an agreement between NEP and NextEra Energy to structurally modify NEP's IDRs. Here's how it will work: First, IDR fees, based on NEP's most recently declared distribution to current LP unitholders at an annualized rate of $1.41 per unit, are roughly $56 million per year. 
 Second, NextEra Energy's ability to achieve incremental IDR fees above $56 million from this point forward is predicated on NEP delivering LP distributions at an annualized rate above $1.41 to all unitholders. If LP distributions exceed $1.41 per unit, the excess above $1.41 is split 75% to common unitholders and 25% to IDR fees. 
 Finally, IDR fees would fall below $56 million per year in the unlikely event that annualized LP distributions ever fall below $1.41 per unit. This structural modification to NEP's IDR fee is centered on value creation for both NEE shareholders and NEP common unitholders. 
 Let me take a minute to explain our logic. By reducing IDR fees on future growth, we expect there to be significantly more cash available to LP unitholders. And as a result, we expect levered returns or ROEs for NEP common unitholders to increase from the high single digits to the low double digits on future asset dropdowns. 
 Also, if there is significantly more cash available to LP unitholders, NEP will need to acquire fewer assets to achieve the same level of distribution growth. If NEP acquires fewer assets, it will need to issue less equity. In fact, it is our expectation that with the structural IDR -- with this structural IDR modification, NEP can now achieve its distribution growth targets for 2017 and potentially 2018 without issuing common equity. This, of course, is aside from any modest equity issuance that NEP may execute through its at-the-market program. 
 Putting it all together, these benefits are expected to provide a longer runway of LP's distribution growth. By reducing NEP's equity needs and extending its distribution growth runway, we expect the increased certainty around growth to translate into improvements in NEP's trading yield and valuation. If NEP's value improves due to these benefits, so does the value of NEE's ownership position in NEP. In addition, NEE should receive more cash distributions over time as NEP's distribution growth runway is extended. 
 Finally, with these changes, NEE should be able to recycle capital and optimize its tax position over a longer period of time. For these reasons, the IDR modification is expected to be accretive to NextEra Energy versus the status quo. 
 I am very excited about the future prospects for NEP and the benefits that we expect for both NEE shareholders and NEP common unitholders as a result of today's announcement. With these changes, we are extending our financial expectations for NEP another 2 years, as we see 12% to 15% per year growth in per unit distributions as a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2022. 
 From a base of our fourth quarter 2016 distribution at an annualized rate of $1.41 per unit, we expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2017 distribution to be in a range of $1.58 to $1.62 per common unit. 
 I want to conclude with some remarks regarding NextEra Energy and its long-term outlook. As John described, 2016 was a terrific year. NextEra Energy's performance was strong both financially and operationally, and we had an outstanding execution on our growth and regulatory initiatives all across the board. We were able to grow 2016 adjusted EPS by 8.4% and delivered total shareholder return of 18.4% that not only beat the S&P utility index but also beat the S&P 500. Amidst the significant growth, the company has maintained one of the strongest balance sheets and credit positions in the industry. 
 A key element of our value proposition at NextEra Energy is a culture focused on delivering outstanding results for our shareholders. Since 2005, we've delivered compounded annual growth in adjusted EPS of over 8%, the highest among the top 10 U.S. power companies by market capitalization. And our total shareholder return over that period outperformed the top quartile of the companies in the S&P 500 utility index. We've also outperformed both the S&P 500 and the S&P utility index in terms of shareholder -- total shareholder return on a 1-year, 3-year, 5-year, 7-year and 10-year basis. We're proud of our long-term track record of providing growth and value-creation opportunities for our shareholders and are completely committed to continuing that track record going forward. 
 Since the November election, our stock performance has been adversely affected by investor concerns regarding the outlook for renewable and tax incentives and its impact on new renewables development, in particular, as well as potential tax reform. We've underperformed since the election, with November 9 being the worst day for NEE's stock performance relative to the S&P 500 in 8 years. And based on 2018 adjusted EPS consensus estimates, we now trade at a slight discount to certain regulated peers. Therefore, I wanted to take a few minutes to address these concerns head on and put them into context in light of our future growth opportunities and our overall financial expectations. 
 Let me start with our opportunity set, which I would not trade with anyone in our industry. At FPL, I'm pleased with the outcome of our 4-year base rate case settlement agreement and what it means for our customers and our shareholders. The outcome allows us to focus on operating the business efficiently, reliably and affordably for the benefit of Florida's customers. The 2016 settlement agreement supports continued smart investments and reliability in clean energy, including storm hardening, grid automation and modernization. Continued fuel efficiency initiatives and the construction of the 1,748-megawatt Okeechobee Clean Energy Center that is expected to achieve commercial operation in 2019. 
 Consistent with our focus on providing clean and cost-effective energy solutions for the benefit of Florida customers, the agreement also provides a solar base rate adjustment upon commercial operations of up to an incremental 1,200 megawatts cost-effective new solar generation approved over the 4-year term of 2017 to 2020. 
 FPL has been working for many years in order to be prepared to add substantial solar capacity affordably for its customers, developing plans and securing sites for cost-effective installations across the state. I'm pleased to report that we have already secured site control on more than 3,000 megawatts of potential solar capacity. And we are working hard to continue to advance this opportunity. 
 In short, we have outstanding growth opportunities at FPL and expect our average annual growth and regulatory capital employed to be roughly 8% per year, over the 4-year term of 2017 through 2020 -- December 2020.  These new investments will benefit Florida customers as FPL's typical 1,000-kilowatt hour residential customer bill is projected to remain below 2006 levels through the year 2020. 
 When you put it all together, low bills, best-in-class reliability, award-winning customer service and a clean emissions profile are all what helped FPL provide what we believe is one of the best customer value propositions in the nation. 
 Turning now to Oncor. We see an opportunity to make 2 already great companies even stronger. Through the same unyielding focus on our customers that has made us successful at FPL, we believe we have the ability to bring real value to Oncor stakeholders. And in turn, find attractive investment opportunities to create long-term shareholder value. The transactions provide Oncor the opportunity to transition from a highly leveraged structure in which financial investors own Oncor, to ownership by a strategic investor with one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector. Under our ownership, we are confident Oncor will be an even stronger company with greater scale and robust financial profile, better positioned than ever to smartly invest capital to improve operations and generate value for its customers, the State of Texas and our shareholders. 
 At Energy Resources, our outlook for new renewables development remains as strong as ever. We continue to build North America's leading portfolio of wind and solar assets, and we have an excellent opportunity to leverage our substantial development capabilities, capture even more opportunities going forward. As John discussed, our actions to safe harbor over 10,000 megawatts of wind are reflections of that enthusiasm. 
 With regard to concerns over renewable tax incentives, I believe it's unlikely that either the PTC or the ITC, which were each extended under a 5-year phasedown by Republican Congress at the end of 2015, will be retroactively changed. Along these lines, it is worth mentioning that during Senate Finance confirmation hearings held last week, the Secretary of Treasury nominee said in a question-and-answer exchange that he was committed to supporting the current phasedown of the wind PTC. A major driver behind bipartisan support for the 5-year phasedown is jobs, with the tremendous growth in renewables responsible for rapid employment gains in the wind and solar industries. Both wind and solar are largely made in America with more than 80% of the typical wind project and 65% of the typical solar project made in the U.S. 
 Renewables also helped stimulate economic growth in rural communities that would otherwise struggle to attract new investment. Renewable energy is an important economic stimulus for these communities as it helps boost state and local tax revenues, which provides funding for schools, hospitals and emergency response, and has direct and indirect economic impacts that help support local small businesses. For these same reasons, I also believe it is unlikely the 4-year start of construction guidance for wind that was released by the Treasury Department in the spring of 2016 will be retroactively changed. Given how rare it is for our government to retroactively change laws, particularly where parties have relied on them to make long-term investment decisions, I believe our safe harbor projects are well positioned to receive the 100% production tax credit through 2020. In addition, we continue to have robust access to tax equity financing. And we already have tax equity financing commitments for the repowering projects that we've announced. 
 State level renewable portfolio standards are now in place in 29 states, and discussions of increasing the renewable requirements under these standards are continuing in certain of these states. At the same time, economic retirements in generation due to low natural gas prices are also expected to continue to create opportunities for new renewables as what and -- as well as long-term natural gas pipelines, particularly as the regulatory environment for pipeline development in oil and gas production continues to improve. 
 As the PTC and ITC phase down, we believe that the economic impact on customer pricing can be absorbed by continued technology and efficiency advancements. We continue to expect yet another major step change in wind turbine technology through a combination of even taller towers and wider rotor diameters, which will further increase net capacity factors. Continued panel costs and efficiency trends are also expected for solar as well as opportunities to reduce balance assistance costs. So even if I am wrong about continued Federal incentives for renewables, as we near the end of this decade, I would expect that in 2020, without PTCs, wind will be -- would be a $0.02 to $0.03 per kilowatt-hour product; and solar, without an ITC, would be in the range of $0.03 to $0.04 per kilowatt-hour. 
 Finally, in addition to top line growth, we remain very focused on operational cost effectiveness, productivity and opportunities to further leverage technology. Toward that end, we've launched a company-wide initiative to reimagine absolutely everything we do, which we call Project Accelerate. This new initiative builds upon the success from Project Momentum that was launched in 2013. Although we are only halfway through our review process, we're pleased with our progress and expect to achieve several hundred million dollars in efficiencies over the next few years from Project Accelerate. 
 Based on the strength and diversity of our growth prospects, today, we are extending NextEra Energy's financial expectations by 2 years from 2018 to 2020. 
 Putting it all together and setting aside the potential accretion we see with our proposed Oncor transactions, we expect NextEra Energy's compound annual growth rate and adjusted EPS to be in the range of 6% to 8% through 2020 off a 2016 base, while maintaining our strong current credit ratings. 
 Let me now turn to tax reform. Although it's premature to draw any firm conclusions given that the tax reform discussion is still in the very early stages, we have spent a lot of time over the last few months considering several what-if tax reform scenarios. We've modeled the scenario where there is a 15% corporate tax rate with current depreciation rules and full interest deductibility, which we call the administration's plan scenario. We've also modeled a scenario where there's a 20% corporate tax rate with immediate expensing and no interest deductibility, which we call the house blueprint scenario. Off of our 2020 baseline, we would expect the administration's plan scenario to be approximately $0.30 to $0.40 per share accretive; and the house blueprint scenario to be approximately $0.10 to $0.15 per share dilutive. The difference between the 2 scenarios is largely driven by the lack of interest deductibility in the house blueprint scenario. 
 Taken together under most reasonable scenarios, we would expect the impacts of tax reform to be manageable. Moreover, combining these same tax scenarios with what we view as a very unlikely renewables downside case where our renewable build-out is 50% lower than our current expectations, we would still expect to be able to achieve the midpoint of our adjusted EPS growth range through 2020. 
 As a result, while there certainly will be challenges that we'll have to manage over the next 4 years, due to the overall strength and diversity of our opportunity set, I will be disappointed if we are not able to continue to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our range, again, all the while maintaining our strong credit ratings. 
 In summary, we continue to believe that we have one of the best opportunity sets and execution track records in the industry. I am as enthusiastic as ever about our future prospects. NextEra Energy and NEP continue to make excellent progress across the board against all our strategic and growth initiatives. Today's announcements of increasing our expectations for both companies are reflections of that enthusiasm. 
 With that, we'll now open the lines for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Julien Dumoulin-Smith at UBS. 
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: So well done, very well done. Perhaps just a quick clarification on everything you just said. On 2018, the long-term EPS growth, to what extent is it predicated on the Oncor transaction following through both in the 2018 but also beyond period? And if it's not reflected, can you just preliminarily provide some sense as to how you would think about the increment? 
John Ketchum: Yes, so what we have said is in extending the guidance through 2020 at 6% to 8%, we're setting aside the accretion from Oncor. Jim just went through a number of sensitivities in terms of our view regarding our expectations. Just to be clear, one of those sensitivities was around tax reform. And he outlined the administration's plan and then the blueprint scenario. And then the other was a renewable downside case. where 50% of the expected renewable demand fell away. If you combine those 2 things, we would still expect to be at the midpoint of our range through 2020. And then, obviously, as Jim ended the call, his expectation would be for us to finish near the top end of the range. And there are a number of factors that could allow us to do that, Oncor being one of them. 
James Robo: Julien, the only thing I would add is that -- and I've said this publicly about the Oncor transaction, obviously, we remain as committed as ever to getting it done. We -- I said earlier when we announced it that it would help us grow at the top end of the range through 2018. And I also said that we have a lot of growth levers, and I would be disappointed if we weren't able to grow at the top end of the range even if we can't close Oncor. And I remain that. And I -- just to address a couple other questions that we've gotten on the Oncor transaction, we've been asked over the last several weeks by investors what were our reactions to the testimony filed in the Oncor proceeding. And I just wanted to address -- take a chance to address that as well here. Over -- almost over the last nearly 2 decades, we've invested an awful lot in Texas, about $8 billion. And NextEra has one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector. And as I said before, we are unwilling to compromise our A- corporate credit rating as a result of any transaction, including the Oncor transactions. We've structured that transaction to save Oncor customers hundreds of millions of dollars by removing the debt that hangs over Oncor right now. And that is going to allow Oncor to operate at NextEra Energy's credit rating of A-, which, of course, is an upgrade for Oncor. Unfortunately, for example, there's -- there are requests in the testimony filed by outside consultants for certain of the interveners would result in NextEra being immediately downgraded once that debt is moved by either prohibiting NextEra from appointing a majority of the Oncor board or placing restrictions on dividends and approval of capital and operating budgets. And we need to address these issues in order to be -- avoid being downgraded, so we can close the transaction. And if we can't address those issues, otherwise -- unfortunately, we wouldn't be able to close. Texas has been a terrific state in most business in investment. And we're confident that the commission is going to give our filing a full and fair review and that we can demonstrate that this transaction makes sense for Oncor, its customers and for Texas. 
Operator: We'll move next to Greg Gordon at Evercore ISI. 
Greg Gordon: Not to beat a dead horse guys, but I just want to be clear that your pro formas and the guidance for this year and next year completely exclude any assumption that Oncor's integrated into the NextEra family, correct? 
John Ketchum: Yes, again our guidance through 2020 sets aside the accretion from Oncor. 
Greg Gordon: Okay, fair enough. In your house blueprint scenario, with the 20% tax rate, loss of interest deductibility, that also includes 100% expensing so you would include the headwind to rate base growth off of your 8% base case in that scenario? 
John Ketchum: That's correct. 
Greg Gordon: Okay. And then are you assuming interest deductibility as only loss on prospective issuance or that it impacts current balances? 
John Ketchum: Everything. 
Greg Gordon: Okay. So not just prospective but prospective and on current balances? 
John Ketchum: That's correct. We have not assumed a phasedown. 
Greg Gordon: Okay. Can you tell us whether or not there's been a significant change in the pace or scale of your ongoing developing opportunities in the wind or solar business, post the election? In other words, as you think about how your book-to-bill is growing over the course of -- how that's grown over the course of the last several months now, it's going to grow over the course of next year, have you had to reevaluate the pace of growth, given the tenor of negotiations given the change in the White House? 
John Ketchum: I will turn that over to Armando. But I think just the results that we've shown today with the 640 megawatts in this call and 3,500 from last year, we're certainly not seeing a falloff in customer demand. But I'll let Armando fill in with more detail. 
Armando Pimentel: Hey, John, that's right. I mean, we haven't seen anything come off the table. And it's still a steady state of RFP and bilateral opportunities coming in. And at least my expectation, we're still having a lot of discussions with customers, and they're not really focused on it, honestly. There's a little bit of talk about, "Hey, let's try to get something done in the earlier years." But I fully expect '17 and '18 to be really good origination years for renewables. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Stephen Byrd at Morgan Stanley. 
Stephen Byrd: Just thinking through the interest deductibility, the guidance that you provided is very helpful. I've been trying to think through interest deductibility for your renewables development business. Assuming that, that were to be eliminated, is this something that essentially gets worked into future PPAs? In other words, wouldn't necessarily have a huge impact in your financing decisions, but it's just something that naturally gets worked into the overall economics of your projects? 
John Ketchum: Yes, it naturally gets worked into the overall economics of the projects. And remember, what we have to do is maintain our relative competitive advantages. And so to the extent it's an impact on us, it's also an impact on everybody else. And so we feel very good about our ability to maintain the competitive advantages that we've shared with investors over the past, even if that were to occur. 
James Robo: Stephen, the other thing I would add is remember, much of the renewable financing we do is tax equity financing and isn't impacted at all by the loss of interest rate deductibility -- of interest deductibility. 
Stephen Byrd: All good points, thank you. And then just thinking about the cost savings, it's a fairly impressive program that you're embarked on. When we think about achievability and factoring this into guidance, Jim, it sounded like you're quite encouraged by what you're seeing. But could you just talk a little bit more in terms of how achievable you see that? How much is factored into guidance? How much we should be thinking about that in terms of risk to achieving your target? 
James Robo: Yes, I feel very good about our team's ability to execute against what we've seen so far. And I think just like Project Momentum, the achievability is going to be high. And it's one of the initiatives that we have going on that makes me able to say that I'll be disappointed if we can't grow at the top end of the range through 2020. 
Operator: We'll go next to Paul Ridzon at KeyBanc. 
Paul Ridzon: Had just a detailed question. At FPL in the fourth quarter, you had some pretty poor weather. You had a hurricane, yet you still were able to reverse some reserve amortization and maintain the 11.5% trailing 12% ROE. Kind of what happened there? 
John Ketchum: Well, we had a balance of $230 million in reserve amortization going into the year. And the weather, against our expectations in terms of surplus amortization, was a bit better, which allowed us to add another $20 million in the fourth quarter from $230 million to $250 million. And we had very good O&M management during the quarter as well. 
Paul Ridzon: So O&M was a big help. 
James Robo: Thank you. 
Paul Ridzon: And are you going to do an Analyst Day this year? 
John Ketchum: We are. We are still planning to do an Analyst Day in the spring but want to get through the Oncor proceedings first. 
Paul Ridzon: So it'll be after the Oncor order comes out? 
John Ketchum: It would, that's correct. 
Operator: We'll go next to Michael Lapides at Goldman Sachs. 
Michael Lapides: Two questions on the near side. First, can you talk a little bit about how much or how significant the PTC roll-off will be? And what 's embedded in your 2017 and 2018 guidance? That's the first question. Second, can you talk about the opportunity set? And I know this will be a little bit longer term for incremental midstream or pipeline development, outside of what you're already undertaking with Sabal Trail, Mountain Valley and others. 
Armando Pimentel: So I think that I'm going to get a better number here soon, but I think the PTC roll-off here for the next couple of years is in the $30 million to $40 million category. And yes, so that's a good number, I'm hearing. On the midstream and pipeline development opportunities, Michael, I mean there's still a bunch of opportunities out there. We've talked about this before. We're the -- I don't know that we're the new kid on the block, but we are the newer kid on the block. We've been fairly successful, including the MVP development, which is going quite well, by the way. We've got a couple of others that we're working on right now. There's certainly not a shortage of opportunities. But whether those opportunities make long-term sense for us remains to be seen. At least one of the opportunities I feel pretty good about. So we've said before that we would be disappointed if we did not have another significant investment opportunity to announce in the pipeline space by 2020; that remains to be the case. We have certainly poured some significant G&A into greenfield development there. And I expected that we'll get something that's beneficial for all of us. 
Operator: We'll take our next question from Alex Kania at Wolfe Research. 
Alex Kania: This is -- this happened recently, I guess, last night. But just any takes on the changes at FERC with Bay leaving? And any impact to you on kind of any important proceedings you might have on pipeline approvals, MVP or other things? 
James Robo: So Alex, this is Jim. I actually got a note from Joe Kelliher, who's on our team, about this last night. And while FERC won't have a quorum, that won't prevent them from issuing orders with 2 commissioners. So we don't see any impact from only having 2 commissioners right now. I would expect that to get addressed relatively soon by the new administration as well. 
Operator: And our next question comes from Shar Pourreza at Guggenheim Partners. 
Shahriar Pourreza: Jim, can you comment on whether NextEra and some peers are seeking some sort of a utility carve-out under a potential new tax regime? 
James Robo: Yes, I think -- Shar, I think what I can say is obviously the industry understands the importance of tax reform for both the U.S. economy as well as for our industry, and it's important to get it right. And we're working very hard to make sure that our voice is heard and that whatever happens with tax reform is both great for the U.S. economy and also doesn't impact customer -- our customer bills and in our industries. So I think that's all I can say about it. It's very early right now, as I said in the prepared remarks. And there's still a long way to go on this, and we'll be updating. We'll continue to keep everyone informed. I know it's a very important issue to investors, the impacts of tax reforms. It's a very important issue for us. And I can also tell you that I'm very engaged on it. 
Shahriar Pourreza: Okay, got it. That's helpful. And then just on the lower corporate taxes, whether it's the Republican plan or the Trump plan, just from a mechanical standpoint of that P&L, is there -- in your scenario now, so you're assuming that the higher deferred tax liabilities are sort of paid off to the life of the assets? Or is there a scenario where you could sort of think that your -- you can use short-term borrowings and sort of finance the liabilities under a quicker scenario and paying back sooner, and obviously, boost your rate base? 
John Ketchum: I think a reasonable way to think about it right now and the way we've been thinking about it is that would be flowed back to customers over the remaining useful economic life of the assets. 
Shahriar Pourreza: Okay. So no use of short-term borrowings to finance it under a quicker scenario. 
John Ketchum: I don't think so. 
Operator: And we'll go next to Andrew Hughes at Credit Suisse. 
Andrew Hughes: As you've worked through some of the implications of tax reform, curious if you've considered some of the impacts to renewable project cash flows? And if that, at all, changes how you think about the drop-down schedule at NEP, either geographically or mix of wind or solar or gas, particularly as you kind of look out on the distribution growth pathway? 
John Ketchum: No, it really has not changed the way we think about NEP. We still believe that we'll be able to secure tax equity financing. And in terms of tax equity financing, our view is that we'll continue to get first allocation on it. And even if there is some impact from tax reform on the banks, their tax base will still be high, they'll still need tax equity. If anybody is impacted from a decline in the supply of tax equity, it's going to be the resi solar folks first. And then it's going to be the smaller wind developers second. So in some ways, I could see it creating a bit of a competitive advantage, but we have ways to manage around tax equity and don't really view it as being a big impact to our business going forward. 
Andrew Hughes: That's helpful. And then just quickly on the repowering front. Among the 1.6 gigawatts, do any of those -- are those still primarily for projects with hedges for off-take contracts? Have you been able to find the opportunities for PPA projects? And if not, just maybe you could discuss some of the challenges there and your expectations to overcome them going forward? 
Armando Pimentel: It's Armando. The 1.6 that we've announced is really just hedged projects. But in the last 3 months, we've made some, I'd say, pretty good development in engaging our PPA counterparties and amending or trying to amend those PPAs. I feel pretty good about it. I mean if we didn't feel pretty good about it, we wouldn't have said that we still -- we would expect $2 billion to $2.5 billion from this program. To get up to that $2 billion to $2.5 billion of investment, you're going to have to amend some of the current power purchase agreements that are out there. And I will tell you that all of the counterparties -- we have not spoken to all the counterparties obviously at this point. But all of the counterparties that we have spoken with are very interested in taking on repowered projects. 
Operator: And we'll go next to Colin Rusch at Oppenheimer Company. 
Shivani Sood: This is Shivani Sood on for Colin Rusch. Two questions for us. We're seeing a rapid evolution of microgrid technology performance and cost. Can you just kind of talk about how you see the corporate, university, military microgrids fitting into your development plans? 
Eric Silagy: This is Eric. We don't see a lot of penetration right now and/or interest on microgrids. Obviously, there're still folks who are pursuing that in different parts of the country. In Florida, the value proposition that we provide folks really has just focused on, if anything, I guess, a little bit more towards the energy efficiency. But that's really driven more by building codes here. So on the microgrid side, I wouldn't say there's been a lot of movement on it. Obviously, technology is something that's driven our business quite a bit. We've adopted a lot on the smart grid technology. That's helped us take costs out of the business and improve the liability. And that's something that we passed on to customers through lower bills and better performance. 
Shivani Sood: Great. And then just as you look at your solar development portfolio and the ongoing cost declines in equipment prices, how much incremental profitability are you seeing in your solar development portfolio? 
James Robo: Possibility in terms of cost reductions? Or development opportunities? Cost reductions? 
Shivani Sood: Yes. 
James Robo: So cost reductions, I mean we're still expecting on a $1 per kW basis for solar to get down to probably pretty close to $1,000 kW by the end of 2020. That's built into all of our expectations at Energy Resources as to what could get done. And that's built into the expectations that Jim talked about during the prepared remarks where he said by the end of 2020 or early in the next decade, you've got PPA prices that are probably close to $0.03 to $0.04. 
Operator: And that concludes today's question-and-answer session and today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

With that, I will turn the call over to John.
John Ketchum: Thank you, Amanda, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin my remarks on our third quarter results, I would like to say a few words about Hurricane Matthew. As you know residents of the Caribbean and South-Eastern US were recently impacted by the severe effects of this dangerous and deadly storm. Our deepest sympathies are with those who have been impacted by Hurricane Matthew's widespread destruction. Since 2006, FPL has invested more than $2 billion to build a stronger, smarter and more storm-resilient energy grid. Earlier this month when Hurricane Matthew affected FPL's service territory along Florida's East Coast, these investments benefited customers by resulting in fewer outages and faster restoration. In response to the hurricane, FPL deployed more resources pre-storm than ever before, which, together with its grid investments, enabled the company to restore service to 98.7% of the 1.2 million affected customers by the end of the second full day after the storm left our service territory. At the height of restoration, FPL's workforce numbered 15,000, including our own employees along with workers from contracting companies and our partner utilities across the country. I would like to personally thank each member of this team for their dedicated service during this critical period for our customers. In addition, earlier today NextEra Energy announced it has reached an agreement for an affiliate to merge with Texas Transmission Holdings Corporation, including TTHC’s approximately 20% indirect interest in Oncor Electric Delivery for total cash consideration of approximately $2.4 billion. In addition, we have reached agreement to acquire the remaining 0.22% interest in Oncor that is owned by Oncor Management Investment, LLC for total cash consideration of approximately $27 million. If approved, these transactions, when combined with NextEra Energy’s previously announced merger with Energy Future Holdings for its 80% interest in Oncor, would result in NextEra Energy owning 100% of Oncor. I will provide additional details on this announcement after reviewing our financial results. Turning now to our financial performance, both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners delivered strong third quarter results and, building upon solid progress made in the first half of the year, we remain well positioned to achieve our overall objectives for 2016. NextEra Energy’s third quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 9% from the prior-year comparable period, primarily reflecting contributions from continued investments at both Florida Power & Light and Energy Resources. Equally as important, both principal businesses executed well on our major initiatives and it was a period of continued advancement in our opportunity set for new renewables. At FPL, pursuing a balanced outcome in our base rate case to support continued execution of our successful strategy for customers remains a core focus. Since the last call, we completed the technical hearing for the case and, after months of negotiation, we are pleased to have reached, with three intervenors, what we believe is a fair and constructive, long-term settlement agreement that will allow us to continue to focus on operating the business efficiently and reliably for the benefit of customers. A one-day hearing was held last Thursday to consider the proposed settlement agreement. We expect the Florida Public Service Commission to vote on our agreement at their agenda conference on November 29th. Our major capital initiatives progressed well and we were pleased to receive Commission approval on our proposal to acquire and phase out the Indiantown Cogeneration facility. I will provide additional details on these updates, as well as FPL’s solid financial performance during the third quarter, in just a moment. At Energy Resources, contributions from new investments were the principal driver of growth and our major activities remain on track to support delivery of roughly 2,500 megawatts of new contracted renewables projects in 2016. We continue to execute on our backlog and pursue additional contracted renewable development opportunities, and it was an excellent period of new project origination. Since the last call, I am pleased to report that our development organization has added almost 2,000 megawatts of renewables projects for post-2016 delivery to our backlog, including approximately 600 megawatts of new wind projects and roughly 1,300 megawatts of additional repowering opportunities within Energy Resources’ existing US wind portfolio. We continue to conduct due diligence to identify the full opportunity set, and I will provide our latest thoughts on our expectations for repowering projects later in the call. Energy Resources’ continued ability to expand its pipeline of growth opportunities is expected to benefit NEP. Since the last call, NEP completed its third major acquisition this year from Energy Resources with the addition of an approximately 132 megawatt share of high-quality, long-term contracted solar generation. We continue to believe that the scale, financial strength, experience and track record of its best-in-class sponsor are what set NEP apart from other infrastructure alternatives. This acquisition is also another example of why NEP is important to NextEra Energy, as it highlights the value of the Energy Resources’ contracted renewables portfolio, enables the recycling of capital from operating assets back into development projects, and enhances NextEra Energy’s tax efficiency. NEP continued its strong year-to-date financial performance, delivering third quarter adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution in line with our expectations. The NEP Board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.34125 per common unit or $1.365 per common unit on an annualized basis, up 26% from a year earlier. Overall, with three strong quarters now behind us, we are well positioned for the year and are very pleased with the progress we are making at both NEE and NEP. Now let’s look at the detailed results, beginning with FPL. For the third quarter of 2016, FPL reported net income of $515 million and earnings per share of $1.11, up $0.04 per share year-over-year. Regulatory capital employed increased by 8.6% over the same quarter last year and was the principal driver of FPL’s net income growth. Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.5% for the 12 months ended September 2016. As a reminder, under the current rate agreement we record reserve amortization entries to achieve a predetermined regulatory ROE for each trailing 12-month period. We ended the second quarter of 2016 with a balance of $71 million and, due to higher base revenues driven by weather-related usage and customer growth, we reversed $159 million of reserve amortization in the third quarter. We believe the remaining reserve amortization balance of $230 million, coupled with our current CapEx and O&M expectations, will allow us to support a year-end regulatory ROE of 11.5%, which is the upper end of the current allowed range. Based on what we see right now, we are likely to end the year with a positive reserve amortization balance, which, under the terms of the proposed 2016 rate agreement, we would be able to utilize over the next four years. Earlier this month, we were pleased to receive approval from the Florida Public Service Commission on our proposal to acquire and phase out the Indiantown Cogeneration facility, a 330 megawatt coal-fired power plant that has a contract to supply capacity and energy to FPL through 2025. With an expected closing date for the transaction in early 2017, we plan to purchase the ownership interest in the facility for $451 million, including existing debt. Similar to the acquisition of Cedar Bay that we closed in the third quarter of 2015, the transaction is expected to enable early retirement of one of the highest greenhouse gas emitting power plants in the state while also providing estimated customer savings of $129 million. In addition, construction has continued to progress well on FPL’s three 74.5 megawatt utility scale solar PV projects that we expect to enter service this year. During the quarter, we were pleased to announce the completed installation of half of the 1 million new solar panels that will comprise these new solar energy centers. Once complete, these projects will roughly triple the solar capacity on FPL’s system and add to the overall fuel diversity of our fleet, which is important for FPL and its customers. Consistent with our commitment to provide low bills and clean energy solutions for the benefit of Florida customers, the proposed 2016 rate agreement, if approved, allows FPL to recover in rates up to an incremental 1,200 megawatts of cost-effective new solar generation approved over the four year term of 2017 through 2020. This would allow Florida customers to benefit from favorable tax incentives, cost declines and efficiency improvements in solar technology that, together, make universal solar a cost-effective source of energy for our customers. The Florida economy remains healthy. The state’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate of 4.7% is below the national rate and Florida’s annual job growth rate has exceeded the nation’s rate since 2012. The latest readings of Florida’s Consumer Sentiment have remained close to post-recession highs. FPL’s third quarter retail sales increased 4% from the prior-year comparable period, and we estimate that approximately 3.2% of this amount can be attributed to weather-related usage per customer. On a weather-normalized basis, third quarter sales increased 0.8%. Continued customer growth of approximately 1.4% was partially offset by a decline of 0.6% in weather-normalized usage per customer. Looking ahead, we expect year-over-year weather-normalized usage per customer to average between zero and negative 0.5% per year for the foreseeable future. FPL was impacted by Hurricane Hermine in September 2016 and Hurricane Matthew in October 2016. Although FPL has not completed the final accounting, our preliminary estimate of storm restoration costs is currently approximately $350 million. Prior to the storms, FPL’s storm and property insurance reserve had the capacity to absorb approximately $112 million in additional storm restoration costs. The remaining balance of the storm restoration costs not covered by the reserve will be deferred and recorded as a regulatory asset on FPL’s balance sheet. Under the 2012 rate agreement, beginning 60 days following the filing of a cost recovery petition with the FPSC, FPL is authorized to recover the remaining balance of the storm restoration costs on an interim basis from customers through surcharges, plus an additional $117 million to replenish the reserve to the level authorized by the 2012 rate agreement. Interim recovery is available for costs that in total for the calendar year do not exceed $4 for every 1,000 kilowatt-hours of usage on monthly residential bills based on a 12-month recovery period. FPL intends to file a petition with the FPSC in the fourth quarter of 2016 to seek interim recovery of storm restoration costs under this mechanism. As a reminder, FPL filed its formal request on March 15th for rate relief beginning in January 2017, following the expiration of our current settlement agreement. The proceeding has encompassed an extensive evidentiary process and during the quarter, we completed the technical hearing for the case and subsequently submitted our post-hearing brief in mid-September. After months of negotiation, we reached a proposed settlement agreement in early October with three of the intervenors in the proceeding; the Office of Public Counsel, the South Florida Hospital and Healthcare Association, and the Florida Retail Federation. The four-year proposed agreement beginning January 2017 and ending December 2020 provides for retail base revenue adjustments as shown in the accompanying slide and an allowed regulatory return on equity of 10.55% with a range of 9.60% to 11.60% and no change to our equity ratio from investor sources. The proposed agreement also includes the flexibility over the four-year term to amortize up to $1 billion of depreciation reserve surplus, plus any reserve amount remaining at the end of this year under FPL’s 2012 rate agreement. As I mentioned earlier, the proposed agreement also provides for solar base rate adjustments or SoBRA, upon commercial operations of up to 300 megawatts annually of new solar generation, subject to a cost cap of $1,750 per kilowatt and a showing of overall cost-effectiveness for FPL’s customers. We expect our regulatory capital employed to be consistent with our rate case filing plus any incremental solar investment opportunities we move forward with under the SoBRA if approved by the Commission. Under the proposed agreement, FPL would continue to recover prudently incurred storm costs consistent with the framework in the current settlement agreement. Future storm restoration costs would be recoverable on an interim basis beginning 60 days from the filing of a cost recovery petition, but capped at an amount that could produce a surcharge of no more than $4 for every 1,000 kilowatt-hour of usage on residential bills during the first 12 months of cost recovery. Any additional costs would be eligible for recovery in subsequent years. If storm restoration costs were to exceed $800 million in any given calendar year, FPL could request an increase to the $4 surcharge to recover the amount above $400 million. The proposed agreement also authorizes a continuation, with minor modification, of the Incentive Mechanism for sharing with customers the gains that we achieve in excess of a threshold amount for our gas and power optimization activities, and introduces a 50 megawatt battery storage pilot program designed to enhance service for customers or operations of solar facilities. FPL has agreed to not seek incremental recovery of the revenue requirements associated with the battery storage pilot program until its next general base rate case. We believe the proposed settlement is fair, balanced and constructive, and supports our continued ability to provide clean, highly reliable, low-cost service for our customers through the end of the decade. Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported third quarter 2016 GAAP earnings of $307 million, or $0.66 per share. Adjusted earnings for the third quarter were $279 million, or $0.60 per share. Energy Resources’ contribution to third quarter adjusted earnings per share increased $0.11 or approximately 22% from the prior-year comparable period. New investments added $0.27 per share, including $0.14 from continued growth in our contracted renewables portfolio. Contributions from new investments in natural gas pipelines were $0.13 per share, including a positive $0.09 impact resulting from a reduction in the contingent earn-out liability that was recorded as part of the Texas Pipelines acquisition last year. The earn-out, which was originally recorded at roughly $200 million, is required to be paid if contracts for growth projects on the NET Mexico pipeline are signed by December 31, 2016 and if those expansion projects meet several precedent conditions. Recently, NET Mexico completed a non-binding open season. While the results of that open season were encouraging in terms of capacity expansion on the pipeline, we are still in the process of evaluating the responses and are having discussions with potential shippers over precedent agreements. However, based on the information we have to date, we no longer believe that the full $200 million will be payable. We will have a more detailed update in the fourth quarter earnings call, as we move to sign capacity agreements with the parties that have expressed an interest in new capacity. The NET Mexico pipeline remains well positioned as it has one of the lowest capacity payments of any pipe serving the growing Mexican market from the US. We remain confident that the Texas Pipelines asset, which is owned by NEP, will deliver on its adjusted EBITDA and CAFD growth expectations that we outlined at the time of the acquisition. Partially offsetting the positive contribution from natural gas pipelines was a $0.09 per share decline in contributions from our upstream gas infrastructure activities, primarily due to lower commodity prices and increased depreciation expense reflecting higher depletion rates. On an annual basis we would expect the $0.09 cents to be roughly $0.15 for the full-year 2016. The contribution from existing generation assets declined by $0.02 per share, partly reflecting the sale of the Lamar and Forney natural gas generation assets earlier in the year, net of interest expense. Fleet-wide wind resource was 100% of the long term average during the quarter. All other impacts reduced results by $0.05 per share, including the effects of increased interest expense reflecting continued growth in the business and share dilution. We remain enthusiastic about the fundamentals for North American renewables growth driven by the continued execution of our development organization, together with our purchasing power, scale in operations, strong access to capital, and cost of capital advantages. As you may recall, the action taken by Congress in December 2015 to extend the wind PTC over a five-year phase down period was further enhanced earlier this year by IRS guidance on start of construction. In addition to the four year start of construction safe harbor for wind, the IRS also released guidance for repowering wind facilities. Among other things, the guidance provides for an 80/20 Rule by which a repowered wind turbine may qualify for a new ten-year PTC period, if the cost of the new equipment incorporated into the turbine is at least 80% of the turbine’s total value. Following our announcement on the last call that we are pursuing repowering opportunities at two of our existing Texas wind projects, the team has continued to conduct due diligence on our existing portfolio. As I mentioned earlier, today we are announcing plans to pursue additional repowering opportunities for roughly 1,300 megawatts to be completed in the 2017-2018 timeframe. We expect to invest approximately $875 million of capital to complete these repowering projects, and earnings from the projects are expected to be comparable to similar new build opportunities with significantly less capital investment. Based on everything we see now, and inclusive of today’s announcement and the announcement from our last call, we expect this opportunity set to continue to grow to support a total of at least $2.0 to $2.5 billion of capital deployment opportunities for repowerings over the next four years, with a greater portion of incremental opportunities expected to become actionable beyond 2018. In addition to our plans to repower certain of our existing wind generation facilities, I am also pleased to report continued strong customer demand for wind. Since the last call, we signed contracts for roughly 600 megawatts of new wind projects, including approximately 500 megawatts for post-2018 delivery. The attached chart updates additional details on where our renewables development program now stands. Together with the repowering opportunities that I just mentioned, we remain comfortable with the overall ranges we have discussed for 2017 and 2018. The development activities for our natural gas pipeline projects remain on track. The Florida pipelines received FERC notice to proceed in August and have commenced full construction activities. We continue to expect an in-service date in mid-2017. As a reminder, NextEra Energy’s investments in Sabal Trail Transmission and Florida Southeast Connection are expected to be roughly $1.5 billion and $550 million, respectively, and FPL is the anchor shipper on both pipelines. The Mountain Valley Pipeline has continued to progress through the FERC process. We continue to expect approximately 2.0 Bcf per day of 20-year firm capacity commitments to achieve commercial operations by year-end 2018. NextEra Energy’s expected investment is roughly $1 billion. Let me now review the highlights for NEP. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution were $174 million and $51 million, respectively, and strong contributions from new assets remained the principal driver of growth from the prior-year comparable period. In addition, existing assets benefited from a favorable year-over-year comparison of overall wind and solar resource. As a reminder, these results are net of IDR fees, which we treat as an operating expense. IDR fees increased $10 million from the prior-year comparable quarter. NEP has executed well against its growth objectives, highlighted by strong access to equity and debt markets. During September, NEP was able to sell to the underwriters, at the time of announcement, the full block of limited partnership units to be issued in connection with the acquisition of a partial interest in the Desert Sunlight Solar Energy Center. This issuance, which raised approximately $297 million, was completed at a lower offering discount and lower trading yield than the prior February offering, and demonstrated yet another source of capital for NEP as we were able to access the retail market for approximately 75% of the issuance. In late September, the underwriters exercised the over-allotment option, which allowed NEP to raise another $45 million. NEP continues to target a long-term capital structure utilizing holdco leverage of approximately 3.5 times project distributions after project debt service and, based on this metric, we estimate our current incremental holdco debt capacity to be roughly $450 to $550 million. Looking ahead, together with our at-the-market dribble program, we expect this debt capacity to allow NEP to continue to be flexible and opportunistic as to future growth opportunities and financing activities. Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy, for the third quarter of 2016, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $753 million or $1.62 per share. NextEra Energy’s 2016 third quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $809 million and $1.74 per share respectively. Adjusted earnings from the corporate & other segment decreased $0.01 per share compared to the third quarter of 2015. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, earlier today NextEra Energy announced it has reached an agreement for an affiliate to merge with Texas Transmission Holdings Corporation, including TTHC’s approximately 20% indirect interest in Oncor Electric Delivery for merger consideration of approximately $2.4 billion. In addition, we have reached agreement to acquire the remaining 0.22% interest in Oncor that is owned by Oncor Management Investment LLC for total cash consideration of approximately $27 million. If approved, these transactions, when combined with NextEra Energy’s previously announced transaction with Energy Future Holdings for its 80% interest in Oncor, would result in NextEra Energy owning 100% of Oncor. The total transaction consideration implies an enterprise value for Oncor of $18.7 billion. Under the terms of the TTHC merger agreement, NextEra Energy will pay TTHC 100% of the merger consideration in cash. As a result of the transaction, no debt will reside at TTHC or Texas Transmission investment upon close of the merger. We expect to fund the merger consideration through a combination of debt and equity, consistent with our commitment to maintaining NextEra Energy’s strong balance sheet and credit ratings. We believe the transaction further affirms NextEra Energy’s commitment to Oncor, its customers in the state of Texas. As a reminder, NextEra Energy previously announced on July 29 a proposed transaction with Energy Future Holdings that would result in NextEra Energy owning approximately 80% of Oncor Electric delivery. The definitive agreement is part of an overall plan of reorganization designed to allow Energy Future Holdings to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy. During the quarter, the United States Bankruptcy Court for the district of Delaware approved EFH’s entry into the merger agreement and we were also pleased to achieve additional credit support for the EFH transaction. Although there is inherent uncertainty involved with the bankruptcy process, we currently expect a creditor vote in confirmation hearing in the fourth quarter in order to be in a position to receive bankruptcy court confirmation of the plan of reorganization by the end of the year. Separate from the bankruptcy approval process, together with Oncor, we look forward to filing by November 1, our joint application with the Public Utility Commission of Texas, seeking approval of our proposed acquisition. Based on our current targets for completing key milestones, and subject to required approvals, we expect the transactions to close in the first half of 2017. If approved, the transactions with EFH, TTHC and OMI, which would result in NextEra Energy owning 100% of Oncor are expected to be meaningfully accretive to earnings, enabling NextEra Energy to grow at or near the top end of it’s previously announced 6% to 8% per year adjusted earnings per share growth rate through 2018, off a 2014 base. Through the transactions, we see an opportunity to make two already great companies even stronger. In addition, we expect that Oncor’s credit rating will be improved post-closing, generating real savings for customers in terms of lower borrowing costs. NextEra shares Oncor’s commitment to providing affordable and reliable electric service, and providing high-quality customer service for the benefit of Oncor’s customers and the continued economic growth of the state. We believe the transactions are beneficial for all key stakeholders, including the state of Texas and Oncor’s customers, the creditors of the EFH bankruptcy estate, and NextEra Energy’s shareholders. Setting aside the potential for accretion that we see with our proposed Oncor transaction, we continue to expect 2018 adjusted earnings per share at NextEra Energy to be in the range of $6.60 to $7.10, implying a compound annual growth rate off our 2014 base of 6% to 8%. In addition, we continue to expect to grow our dividends per share 12% to 14% per year through at least 2018, off a 2015 base of dividends per share of $3.08. For this year, we continue to expect 2016 adjusted earnings per share at NextEra Energy to be in the range of $5.85 to $6.35. Within this range, it is worth noting that we believe that we are well positioned to achieve results for 2016 towards the top end of our 6% to 8% per year adjusted earnings per share expectations, again off our 2014 base of $5.30. We hope to be in a position to provide longer-term expectations at an investor conference this spring, following the resolution of the FPL rate proceeding and required milestones in the Oncor approval process. As always, our expectations are subject to the usual caveats, including but not limited to normal weather and operating conditions. Let me now turn to NEP. From a base of our fourth quarter 2015 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $1.23, we continue to see 12% to 15% per year growth in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through 2020, subject to our usual caveats. As a result, we expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2016 distribution to be in a range of $1.38 to $1.41 per common unit, meaning the fourth quarter distribution that is payable in February 2017. The December 31, 2016 run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA of $670 million to $760 million and CAFD of $230 million to $290 million are unchanged, reflecting calendar year 2017 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at year-end December 31, 2016. Today, we are introducing December 31, 2017 run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA of $875 million to $975 million and CAFD of $310 million to $340 million, reflecting calendar year 2018 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at year-end December 31, 2017. The midpoint of this CAFD range reflects roughly 25% growth from the comparable CAFD mid-point based on our December 31, 2016 run rate expectations. Our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and are net of anticipated IDR fees, as we expect these fees to be treated as an operating expense. In summary, both NEE and NEP delivered excellent third quarter results and we are pleased with the progress we have made on all of our major initiatives. At FPL, we continue to focus on operational cost effectiveness, productivity and making long-term investments to further improve the quality, reliability and efficiency of everything we do. At Energy Resources, we have made terrific progress on our development program and continue to feel optimistic about our renewables growth prospects and the quality of our renewables pipeline. For NEP, renewable origination success at Energy Resources continues to expand the pipeline of potential drop-down assets, and NEP has excess debt capacity to enable it to be flexible and opportunistic regarding future growth. Overall, we continue to believe that we have one of the best opportunity sets and execution track records in our industry. That concludes our prepared remarks and with that we will open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.
Stephen Byrd: Hi, good morning. So I wanted to touch on what you, John had mentioned about repowering opportunities, very pleased to see the magnitude of that. I just wanted to make sure I understood your commentary correctly. You were indicating that essentially the capital costs would be lower than the new build which certainly makes sense, but the return would be essentially, as if we are at new build investment levels, so therefore it looks like a relatively attractive return on capital, did I get that right?
John Ketchum: You got that right, so the CapEx is roughly half of the new build and the return is superior to new build transaction.
Stephen Byrd: Okay, great. And in terms of just the kinds of steps you need to go through to actually get these repowerings done, how should we think about execution risk, counterparty negotiations, how much is required in terms of counterparty negotiations, what sort of things we would be thinking about in terms of execution risk?
John Ketchum: Well, on the execution side, we have to negotiate with our counterparties. Some of those counterparty negotiations will include a blend and extend of the existing agreement, but given that the CapEx is again roughly half of the CapEx for new build, and returns are a bit higher, there is a little bit of room for those negotiation with counterparties. That's one of the main execution risks that we have. We also have to study the interconnection agreements to make sure that to the extent we’re providing additional capacity that we have the ability to put that additional capacity online. Those are the main execution risks around the repowering opportunities.
Stephen Byrd: Okay, understood. And you’re laying out 2 billion to 2.5 billion of capital deployment opportunities, so we can sort of do the math to look at the total megawatts involved then I guess?
John Ketchum: That's correct.
Stephen Byrd: Okay. Sorry, and just one last question, and then I’ll get back in the queue. We've seen a number of companies announce their interest in becoming big in wind, we saw one company this morning lay that out. I'm just curious if you could, at a high-level, speak to competitive trends you’re seeing, the kinds of barriers to entry that you see from your perspective, given you’ve been one of the biggest players in wind for a very long time, I'm interested in your perspective on that?
John Ketchum: Sure, Stephen. I'm going to turn that question over to Jim.
Jim Robo: So, Stephen, we've had competitors in this business for 15 years. They've come, they've gone, there is no one in this industry that has the greenfield capabilities that we do, plenty of folks who have -- plenty of folks lay out the fact that they want to be in the wind business and really what they’re in is they are in the wind development project acquisition business at COD, which is frankly not really being in the wind business. Being in the wind business 70% or 80% of the value creation is in the organic development, the Greenfield development of those projects, and there is no one in the industry that has the pipeline that we do, that has the team that we do and the year in and year out track record. I don't, I worry about a lot of things, that's one of the, that’s like very, very low in my list of things that I worry about.
Stephen Byrd: That's great. Thank you very much.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Matt Tucker from KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Matt Tucker: Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. Wanted to ask a few questions about the holdco debt capacity at NEP. I guess first, just curious what kind of changed since you provided an estimate. I think when you announced Desert Sunlight, that was about 75 million lower. I appreciate the math illustration you provided in the slides, but just wasn't clear what changed there. And then just how should we be thinking about how you’re going to look to utilize this debt capacity. Is the target something that you’d look to reach over the next 12 to 18 months, over the next few transactions or how much cushion would you like to kind of leave there for potential periods where you really don't feel like you can access equity and want to continue to make acquisitions?
John Ketchum: Yes. So a few things. On the holdco debt capacity, remember that we’ve financed our July dropdown with largely debt. We then went ahead and equitized the September drop. The cash purchase price for Desert Sunlight was $218 million. We raised about $341 million in equity, which allowed us to pay down our revolver. That really was the main contribution to the additional holdco debt capacity to get us to 450 to 550. In terms of the cushion on debt capacity, I really think that puts us in an opportunistic and flexible position as to how we time future dropdown opportunities and as to how we finance those opportunities. So we will see how things progress in terms of the capital markets going forward, but that does give us flexibility. Also, you got to remember with wind assets, when we drop the wind assets in, you can think the leverage, about the leverage from tax equity being right around 45% to 55%. So we are dropping those out, so it’s down, they’re naturally creating additional holdco debt capacity at the NEP level.
Matt Tucker: Thanks, that's very helpful. And then lastly just your thoughts on the current wind outlook, are we completely past El Nino, are we seeing La Nina, just what you’re kind of seeing over the next 6 to 12 months or however far your outlook is?
John Ketchum: Well, it's tough to look out 12 months and really come up with what an accurate forecast might look like, but certainly we saw return to normal with our third quarter results. So we will see how the fourth quarter progresses.
Matt Tucker: Thanks, guys.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we’ll take our next question from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.
Jonathan Arnold: Good morning, guys. Two quick questions. One on the new contracted wind that is not repowerings, I noticed the 100 megawatts in ‘17 and ‘18, and then 500 is post ‘18, should we anticipate that most of what you do on the backlog is going to be longer dated going forward here or is that just -- these are the nature of some of these deals you signed this quarter, because I know you talked about being unsure whether tax credit extensions were going to push things a little bit out?
Armando Pimentel: Hi, Jonathan. It’s Armando. I wouldn't read too much into that. It is just really the pace of negotiations. What I can say is that there is a lot of activity going on right now for both ‘17 and ‘18 and ‘19 and ‘20 in the contracting market. These two came in kind of at the right time for 2019. But I wouldn't read too much into that other than just timing.
Jonathan Arnold: There you’ve got things, irons in the fire still for ’17 and ’18?
Armando Pimentel: Yes, absolutely. We still feel comfortable with the guidance for the expectations that we have provided to you and we reaffirmed today for ‘17, ‘18.
Jonathan Arnold: Great. And then just, you obviously had a strong third quarter. Last time you spoke publicly, I think you were talking down the second half a little bit versus the first half in terms of growth, and we have you at about 617 trailing 12 earnings. And I was curious why the guidance range, you didn’t take up the low end or is -- are there some challenges in Q4 that we should be thinking about or it feels like you’re tracking pretty well on the year?
John Ketchum: Yes. Jonathan, we did have a good third quarter, but with the fourth quarter, we still do expect the growth to drop off a bit compared to what we saw with 2015 and we are targeting again to be at the upper end of our 6% to 8% range is the way to think about how we will finish the fourth quarter and the full year.
Jonathan Arnold: Okay. So you talked about some tax timing issues in the second half, is that more a Q4 item there or is that still?
John Ketchum: There were some tax timing issues that had benefited the earlier part of the year. That's a part of it. There are some other smaller things as well, not any one thing worth calling out or mentioning.
Jonathan Arnold: All right. Thank you.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer.
Colin Rusch: Thanks so much. I've got two questions. Can you just give us a bit more detail on what's in, the receivable do from a related party at NEP? And then secondly, with the wind repowering opportunity, given the pretty dramatic price declines and battery storage with companies like LG and Tesla offering insulations below $400 a kilowatt hour now, how are you seeing that opportunity change and is there a meaningful [indiscernible] opportunity that you guys are seeing right now.
Jim Robo: Yes. On the dual formulated party for NEP, recall that NextEra Energy provides credit support to NEP, but as part of that credit support arrangement, NextEra energy has the right to benefit from the cache sweeps by taking cash out of those accounts, which it has an obligation to put back in for the benefit of NEP. So that's what the dual formulated parties is. On the battery question, I will defer to Armando.
Armando Pimentel: So we've been talking about batteries now I think for a couple of years and we keep saying that we would expect batteries to be a significant investment opportunity for us sometime earlier in the next decade and it’s tracking based on where we thought our expectations would be. We have roughly currently, well, I’m going to say, about 10 projects, 10 battery projects across the US and Canada, a little bit different technology in each one, but these are fairly small investments that we are making in battery storage, somewhere in the neighborhood of $6 million to $15 million is a potential average for each one of those investments. Whether it’s Teslo as you mentioned or whether it’s other estimates that you and us have seen, I mean battery storage will continue to come down significantly through this decade and we continue to believe that at some point in the next decade, I don’t know whether it will be earlier or whether it will be later, but battery storage will be commercially viable. The costs will come down enough and you will be able to strap it on with renewable technology, whether it’s wind or more likely solar and have a very competitive project in the renewable energy space.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie.
Angie Storozynski: Thank you. So I had one follow-up on the repowerings, so how does the 50% reduction of CapEx versus new build reconcile with the IRS requirement that is an 80% increase in the value of the turbine?
Armando Pimentel: You can't do that reconciliation, Angie. It’s Armando, the way that the 80-20 works is obviously for others on the phone, if you were to go out and completely tear down a wind project and start over, you’d get PTCs on the new investment. Well, the IRS guidance allows you to do a whole bunch of work on those wind projects and 80% of the value that you are putting in. If you meet the 80% test, the entire investment qualifies as new production tax credits. It's based on a fair value method though, not based on a cost method. So when John answered the question before that it’s a lot less capital for repowering opportunities and the economic returns are just as good or better, he was talking about the costs that was going into the wind project, not about the 80-20 test.
Jim Robo: So, Angie, this is Jim. Simply said, it's not 80% of the new build cost, it's 80% of the, whatever you think the value of the existing asset is, and the existing has been typically depreciated by 10 or 11 or 12 years. So it's -- what you’re trying to do is apples and oranges.
Angie Storozynski: Okay. And then all of the purchases that are going to be repowered or considered repowering targets have PPA, so there would be no merchant repowering?
Armando Pimentel: Actually, Angie, all of the projects that we announced today that we’re moving forward on, on the repowering side are all projects that we have long-term hedges on. We have not announced any repowering of projects that have power purchase agreements. So when John mentioned that our expectation that this could be a $2 billion to $2.5 billion program, virtually all of the remaining opportunities that we’re looking at are under power purchase agreements and therefore we would have to have discussions with the counterparty as John mentioned earlier to make sure that we can move forward on those. I feel comfortable that we would move forward on a vast majority of those and that's why we gave CapEx guidance on the total program today.
Angie Storozynski: Okay, thank you. And the last question on NEP, so I understand that you have the corporate debt capacity you can use to finance growth, but as you -- you’re the only one really with active IDRs among yield co and those IDRs require simply more and more assets to be dropped down in order to meet this 12% to 15% growth in distribution per share for LP holders and as such basically your funding requirements are growing quite considerably, as you move to high spreads. Would you consider doing away with IDRs in case there is no recovery in the liquidity in the yield co market on the equity side or do you feel like between co-financing via NextEra or private placements, you can actually price that asset to achieve the growth and pay IDRs?
Armando Pimentel: Angie, the way we look at it, I think the first thing to look at when you’re dealing with a yield co like ours, with a strong sponsor is how many projects, I mean, what's the pipeline at the sponsor to be able to drop down projects, do you have a long pipeline of opportunities to be able to drop down into in this case, NextEra Energy partners, because if you have that, the current economics certainly work. There are, you talked about holdco debt capacity at the beginning of your discussion. I hope it’s clear, I think we've made it clear that we will not be reaching at least our preliminary holdco debt capacity target in 2017. We are slowly increasing the debt capacity at NextEra Energy Partners, so by the end of 2018, at least preliminarily, we believe that we would get to the holdco debt capacity, which gives us, in this market, a tremendous amount of flexibility as to when to be able to raise equity and when to be able to raise additional holdco debt capacity. I think it's just too early in the life of NextEra Energy Partners to really start talking about what we’re going to do in the future with IDRs. We feel comfortable with the way NextEra Energy Partners is working right now, it brings a lot of benefits to NextEra Energy. We’re certainly not comfortable with where it’s trading. I don't think any management team is ever comfortable with where their units are trading, but we feel confident that we, at NextEra Energy, will be able to have a sufficient number of projects for a sufficient number of time in order for NextEra Energy Partners to be successful long-term.
Operator: And we will take our last question from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.
Stephen Byrd: Yes. I just had one follow-up, in terms of the market for tax equity tax appetite, I wondered if you could just give a commentary in terms of high-level overall access, your position there, just your take on the state of monetizing tax attributes?
John Ketchum: Yes. We have seen the tax equity market for our projects continue to hang in there, Stephen. We've seen no issues. I mean of the things that we try to do going into any one year is estimate the amount of tax equity needs that we will have and then we allocate those to our tax equity providers going into the year. So really, it has not been an issue for us with regard to our projects.
Operator: And with no further questions in the queue, that does conclude today's presentation. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

We will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release, in the comments made during this conference call, in the risk factor section of the accompanying presentation, or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found on our website, nexteraenergy.com and nexteraenergypartners.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. Today's presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of certain non-GAAP measures to the closest GAAP financial measure. With that, I will turn the call over to John.
John W. Ketchum - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Thank you, Amanda, and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners each delivered strong second quarter financial results and solid operating performance. NextEra Energy's adjusted earnings per share increased 7% against the prior year comparable quarter, driven by new investments and energy resources. For the first six months, NextEra Energy achieved year-over-year growth of 11% in both adjusted earnings per share and cash flow from operations. NEP grew per unit distributions by 40% from a year earlier and added to what we already considered to be a solid run rate with the acquisition of two high quality wind facilities just after the end of quarter. Both businesses remain on track to achieve the full year financial expectations that we had previously discussed subject to our usual caveats. Florida Power & Light's contribution to second quarter earnings per share was roughly flat, down $0.01 from 2015. Strong growth driven by continued investment in the business was offset by share dilution and a refund to customers related to the decision by the Florida Supreme Court to disallow investments in long-term natural gas supplies. Aside from the impact of this decision, we are very pleased with FPL's financial results. We earned a regulatory ROE of approximately 11.5%, and average regulatory capital employed grew roughly 8.4% over the same quarter last year, reflecting our continued commitment to invest new capital to deliver low bills, high reliability and clean energy solutions for the benefit of our customers. Along these lines, during the quarter, we announced a plan to acquire and phase-out one of the state's highest greenhouse gas emitting coal fire plants located in Morton County, which is expected to result in significant customer savings and substantial reductions in carbon emissions. In addition, we received site certification for the Okeechobee Clean Energy Center that is expected to enter service in mid 2019. Earlier this month, FPL was honored to receive the J.D. Power Award for ranking highest in residential customer satisfaction among large utilities in the South. We work hard to continue to improve service for our customers and are proud that FPL's 2016 score is our highest ever in the study's history. As a reminder, FPL filed its formal request on March 15 for rate relief beginning in January 2017, following an expiration of our current settlement agreement. And I will provide an update on the proceedings thus far in just a moment. Energy Resources continued to benefit from strong contributions from new investments, and this was the principal driver of second quarter growth. We remain poised for another big installation year at Energy Resources and our major activities remain on track to support delivery of approximately 2,500 megawatts of new contractor renewables projects in 2016. If our development program goes as expected, Energy Resources and NEP's combined renewables portfolio will reach approximately 16,000 megawatts by the end of this year. During the quarter, the IRS provided start of construction guidance for the Wind PTC. The guidance provides for a start of construction Safe Harbor of up to four years increased from the two-year Safe Harbor formally put in place for the 2014 PTC. While there is some uncertainty on the impact of timing of customer demand as a result of this increased tenure, we believe that the longer-term impact further strengthens what we already consider to be one of the best environments for renewables development in our history. In addition, the IRS also provided guidance for the repowering of wind projects, and we are pleased to announce that we are currently pursuing repowering opportunities at two of our existing Texas wind projects for roughly 327 megawatts to be completed by the end of 2017. We continue to believe that the longer-term fundamentals for North American renewables growth have never been stronger and that the capabilities of our development organization together with our purchasing power, scale in operations, strong access to capital and cost of capital advantage place us in an excellent strategic position to capture even more opportunities going forward. NextEra Energy Partners portfolio additions over the last year drove substantial growth in cash available for distribution. In turn, the NEP board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.33 per common unit or $1.32 per common unit on an annualized basis. NEP's strong performance was underscored by an approximately 285 megawatt acquisition from Energy Resources earlier this month. Included in the acquisition are the Cedar Bluff and Golden Hills Wind Energy Centers, each commissioned in 2015 with GE Technology. These high-quality wind projects are expected to provide an attractive yield to investors. At the same time, the utilization of debt and cash on hand to fund the purchase price reflects the partnerships' flexible approach to financing and allows NEP to be opportunistic to add to future growth in 2016. Overall, we are very pleased with the results for the quarter. We believe that both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners are well-positioned heading into the second half of the year. Now let's look at the results for FPL. For the second quarter of 2016, FPL reported net income of $448 million and earnings per share of $0.96, down $0.01 per share year-over-year. Continued investment in the business contributed $0.08 of growth in earnings per share versus the prior year comparable quarter, but was offset by the impact of the Woodford Project gas reserve refund and share dilution. We continue to identify opportunities to invest capital for the benefit of customers, with regulatory capital employed, growing by approximately $2.6 billion or 8.4% over the same quarter last year. Similar to the Cedar Bay transaction that closed in the third quarter of last year, we are pursuing a plan to acquire and phase out another coal-fired power plant. The Indiantown Cogeneration facility is a 330 megawatt power plant located in Indiantown, Florida, which has a contract to supply capacity and energy to FPL through 2025. FPL proposes to purchase the ownership interest in the Indiantown Cogeneration facility for $451 million, including existing debt. If approved by the commission, this transaction is expected to result in a significant reduction in the plant's operations and enable earlier shutdown of the facility than would otherwise be the case. This plan is projected to save FPL customers an estimated $129 million and prevent nearly 657,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually. The acquisition, if approved, is expected to close early in 2017 and is another example of our commitment to provide low bills and clean energy solutions for the benefit of Florida customers. Along with Cedar Bay this transaction, if approved, will result in the early retirement of two of the highest greenhouse gas emitting power plants in the state and further FPL's position as a clean energy leader. During the second quarter, we were disappointed that the Florida Supreme Court reversed the PSC's December 2014 approval of the acquisition of long-term natural gas supplies from the Woodford Project. We continue to believe the investment presents a long-term opportunity to hedge potential volatility in the market price for natural gas and we appreciate the PSC's careful consideration of this innovative approach to managing this risk. Our second quarter results include a negative impact of $0.03 per share, reflecting a refund to be provided to customers through future fuel clause proceedings for all revenue requirements accrued to date for this investment, as compared to settled natural gas prices over the same period of time. Going forward, the Woodford Project investment has been removed from customer recovery and we expect physical production to be liquidated in the open market. Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.5% for the 12 months ending June 2016. As a reminder, under the current rate agreement, we record reserve amortization entries to achieve a predetermined regulatory ROE for each trailing 12-month period. During the second quarter, we utilized $16 million of reserve amortization, which was less than we had planned, leaving us with a balance of $71 million for the remainder of 2016. We continue to expect that the balance of the reserve amortization coupled with current CapEx and O&M expectations will allow us to support a regulatory ROE in the upper half of the allowed band of 9.5% to 11.5% through the end of our current rate agreement in 2016. As always, our expectations assume normal weather and operating conditions. Turning now to Florida's economy, the current unemployment rate of 4.7% is the lowest level since 2007, and the number of jobs was up approximately 245,000 or 3% compared with June of last year. Florida's private sector continues to drive the state's job growth and more than 1.1 million private sector jobs have been added since 2010. The real estate sector continues to show strength with new building permits remaining at a healthy level and the Case-Shiller Index for South Florida home prices up 6.3% from the prior year. In addition, the latest readings of Florida's consumer confidence remain near post-recession highs. FPL's second quarter retail sales volume was down 2.5% from last year. We estimate that weather-related usage per customer had a negative impact on year-over-year retail sales of 5.5%. On a weather-normalized basis, second quarter sales increased 3%, comprised of a continued customer growth impact of approximately 1.2%, and increased weather normalized usage per customer of approximately 1.8%. As a reminder, our estimates of weather normalized usage per customer are subject to significant short-term volatility. Looking ahead, we continue to expect year-over-year weather-normalized usage per customer to be between flat and negative 0.5% per year as we saw last year. As we have previously stated, on March 15, we submitted testimony and detailed supporting information for FPL's 2016 base rate proceeding. During the quarter, nine quality of service hearings were conducted across the state and an overwhelming majority of participants spoke positively about the service they receive from FPL. Intervenor and staff testimony were filed earlier this month and we will be submitting rebuttal testimony next week on August 1. We are focused on technical hearings that are scheduled to take place in late August and early September and we expect the staff recommendation and commission ruling on revenue requirements and rates in the fourth quarter. The four year base rate plan has been designed to support continued investments in long-term infrastructure and advanced technology, which improves reliability and helps keep customer bills low. As always, we are open to the possibility of resolving our rate request through a fair settlement agreement and our core focus remains on pursuing a fair and objective review of our case, that supports continued execution of our successful strategy for customers. Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported second quarter 2016 GAAP earnings of $234 million or $0.50 per share. Adjusted earnings for the second quarter were $313 million or $0.67 per share. Adjusted EPS increased $0.10 or approximately 18% year-over-year. Energy Resources' core business results were primarily driven by contributions from new investments of $0.19 per share, reflecting continued growth in our contracted renewables program and contributions from our gas pipeline development projects. These gains were partially offset by a decline in contributions from our existing asset portfolio of $0.04 per share. A favorable impact from the partial reversal of a 2014 income tax charge that resulted from the separation of our Canadian projects to enable them to fit into the overall NEP structure was more than offset by lower state tax incentives, the ongoing impact of PTC roll off and other headwinds versus the prior year comparable quarter. Wind Resources was roughly 92% of the long-term average essentially in line with the second quarter of last year. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide included the impact of unfavorable market conditions on our upstream gas infrastructure activities, and increased interest expense reflecting continued growth in the business. As I mentioned earlier, the action taken by Congress in December 2015 to extend the Wind PTC over a five-year phase down period was further enhanced during the quarter by IRS guidance on start of construction. Subject to beginning significant physical work or meeting certain safe harbor provisions, the guidance extents the PTC for an additional four year period. Therefore, as detailed on the accompanying slide, we now expect that a wind facility that commences construction this year by complying with the Safe Harbor to procure 5% of the total capital to be invested and achieves commercial operation by the end of 2020 will qualify for 100% of the PTC. As compared to the two-year Safe Harbor period that was put in place for the 2014 PTC, we expect this increase tender to help support our U.S. wind development activities further into the next decade and provide a greater overall opportunity set than would otherwise have been the case. While this is terrific for our longer-term potential growth, we remain watchful as to whether it may impact near-term customer demand by delaying some opportunities from 2017 and 2018 to later years. For Solar, we continue to expect IRS start of construction guidance to follow later on given that the commercial operation deadline for the first step of the Solar ITC phase-down is not scheduled to occur until January 1, 2020. Overall, the added planning stability provided by tax incentives are expected to serve as a bridge to further equipment cost decline and efficiency improvements that should enable renewables to compete on a levelized cost of energy basis with gas-fired technology, when tax incentives are ultimately phased down. In addition to the four-year start of construction safe harbor for wind, the IRS also released guidance for repowering wind facilities. The guidance confirms two key points. First, it explains that the 5% safe harbor for starting construction applies to the repowering of wind facilities. Second, it provides an 80-20 rule by which a repowered wind turbine may qualify for new tenure PTC period if the cost of the new equipment incorporated into the turbine is at least 80% of the turbines total value. As I mentioned earlier, we're moving forward with repowering two our Texas' wind assets. We're also conducting due diligence on the rest of our U.S. wind portfolio, and are beginning to talk to customers in order to assess the potential size of this opportunity. We hope to be able to give a more comprehensive update on the size of our repowering initiative before the end of the year. Regardless of the total size, we expect the majority of our repowerings to be in 2018, 2019 and 2020. As a result, we do not expect this opportunity to change our overall financial expectations for NextEra Energy through 2018. The team continues to execute on our backlog and pursue additional opportunities for contracted renewables development. From our total 2015 to 2016 renewables development program of over 4,000 megawatts, roughly 1,500 megawatts were brought into service in 2015 and construction activities remain on-track for the remaining project backlog. If our development program goes as expected, Energy Resources and NEP's combined renewables portfolios will reach approximately 16,000 megawatts by the end of this year. From this space, the expectations we discussed on the last call to bring into service roughly 2,800 megawatts to 5,400 megawatts of new North American renewables projects, over the course of the 2017 to 2018 timeframe, are unchanged. Since the last call, the team signed roughly 200 megawatts of U.S. wind projects, bringing the total contracts currently signed for delivery in this timeframe to approximately 575 megawatts. Including the 327 megawatt repowering opportunities and currently signed contracts for new wind and solar projects, our 2017 to 2018 renewable backlog is now over 900 megawatts. Together, we expect to invest approximately $250 million of capital to complete these repowering projects, which should generate returns similar to new build opportunities. While the team is actively pursuing a number of additional opportunities, we continue to expect that a greater portion of new project demand and in turn, a greater portion of our investment opportunities to be in 2018. Although we are optimistic about the prospects for new renewables growth, it is important to remember that forecasting 2017 and 2018 origination expectations at this stage in 2016 remains subject to a number of uncertainties. Turning now to the development activities for our natural gas pipelines, the Florida pipelines remain on track. FERC approval was received earlier this year and we continue to expect an in-service date in mid 2017. NextEra Energy's investments in Sabal Trail Transmission and Florida Southeast Connection are expected to be roughly $1.5 billion and $550 million respectively and FPL is the anchor shipper on both pipelines. The Mountain Valley Pipeline project in which our expected investment is roughly $1 billion has continued to progress through the FERC process and we continue to expect to achieve commercial operations by year-end 2018. Let me now review the highlights for NEP. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $156 million and cash available for distribution was $65 million, up $54 million and $15 million respectively from the prior-year comparable quarter. Strong contributions from acquisitions were the principal driver of growth. New projects added $68 million of adjusted EBITDA and $28 million of cash available for distribution. After accounting for the results of new project additions, existing projects in the NEP portfolio delivered adjusted EBITDA and CAFD roughly in line with the prior-year comparable quarter. Second quarter wind resource for the NEP portfolio is roughly 91% of the long-term average, which was similar to the prior-year comparable period. As a reminder, these results are net of IDR fees, which we treat as an operating expense. IDR fees increased $8 million from the second quarter last year. The impact of other effects, including higher management fees and outside services are shown on the accompanying slide. As I mentioned earlier, just after the end of the quarter, NEP completed an approximately 285 megawatt acquisition of the Cedar Bluff and Golden Hills Wind Energy Centers for a total consideration of approximately $312 million, subject to working capital and other adjustments plus the assumption of approximately $253 million in liabilities related to tax equity financing. The purchase price for the transaction was funded in part by the issuance of Holdco debt, with the balance of the purchase price funded with cash on hand and through draw under a project level revolving credit facility. The use of Holdco debt is consistent with our target at NEP for a long-term capital structure utilizing Holdco leverage of approximately 3.5 times project distributions after project debt service. Based on this metric, we expect our current incremental Holdco debt capacity to be roughly $300 million to $400 million. Looking ahead NextEra Energy Partners expects to continue to be flexible and opportunistic as to future growth opportunities and financing activities. Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the second quarter of 2016, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $540 million or $1.16 per share. NextEra Energy's 2016 second quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $777 million and $1.67 per share respectively. Adjusted earnings from the corporate and other segment increased $0.02 per share compared to the second quarter of 2015. For the first six months, NextEra Energy achieved year-over-year growth in adjusted earnings per share and operating cash flow of 11%. Our year-to-date results now reflect a first quarter 2016 favorable impact of approximately $17 million or $0.04 per share, not formally included in our first quarter financial statements. This first quarter impact, which occurred as a result of an accounting standards change on March 30, 2016 is expected to be largely representative of a full-year impact, subject to NextEra Energy's stock price volatility and stock option exercise activity. At the corporate level, our base case plan continues to assume no new equity for 2016. The sale of our Lamar and Forney natural gas generation assets located in ERCOT closed at the beginning of the quarter, generating net cash proceeds of approximately $456 million. In addition, we continued to expect opportunities to recycle capital through potential additional sale opportunities of merchant and other non-strategic assets in our portfolio. Capital recycling remains an important part of our financing plan as we continue to execute on our strategy to become more long-term contracted and rate regulated. We remain on track to deliver our EPS expectations for this year and the longer term. For 2016, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share at NextEra Energy to be in the range of $5.85 to $6.35 with more of our growth through a variety of factors expected to occur in the first versus the second half of the year. Based on what we see now, we expect most of our growth in the second half of the year to be in the fourth quarter. For 2018, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share at NextEra Energy to be in the range of $6.60 to $7.10 implying a compound annual growth rate, off a 2014 base of 6% to 8%. In addition, we continue to expect to grow our dividends per share 12% to 14% per year through at least 2018, off a 2015 base of dividends per share of $3.08. As always, our expectations are subject to the usual caveats, including but not limited to normal weather and operating conditions. Turning now to NEP. Following the acquisition of Cedar Bluff and Golden Hills Wind Energy Centers just after the end of the second quarter, we expect the current portfolio to support a CAFD run rate of $230 million to $260 million as of December 31, 2016. As a result, we now expect to exceed the low end of our previously stated December 31, 2016 portfolio run rate CAFD expectation of $210 million. We are also updating the December 31, 2016 run rate for adjusted EBITDA from $640 million to $760 million to $670 million to $760 million, reflecting calendar year 2017 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at year end 2016. Our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and are net of expected IDR fees, as we expect these fees to be treated as an operating expense. From a base of our fourth quarter 2015 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $1.23, we continue to see 12% to 15% per year growth in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectation through 2020, subject to our usual caveats. As a result, we expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2016 distribution to be in a range of $1.38 to $1.41 per common unit, meaning the fourth quarter distribution that is payable in February 2017. In summary, we continue to execute against our strategic and growth initiatives across the board at FPL, Energy Resources and NEP. We remain very focused on our key objectives for the year and are off to a strong start through the first two quarters. Overall, we believe our opportunity set is one the best in the industry and we are well positioned to leverage our businesses to continue to deliver on our growth expectations now and into the future. That concludes our prepared remarks and with that, we will now open the lines for questions.
Operator: Thank you very much, sir. We will now take our next question from Stephen Byrd from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead sir.
Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning.
John W. Ketchum - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Good morning, Stephen.
Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Wanted to discuss the repowering update you provided on the Wind business. It sounds like you're making some good progress. Could you give us a sense of what portion of your fleet would either be sufficiently old that it's run through the PTC or the elected the (30:58) CITC. Is there a rough portion we should be thinking about that could potentially be eligible for repowering?
Armando Pimentel, Jr. - President & Chief Executive Officer, NextEra Energy Resources, LLC: Stephen, it's Armando. Obviously, a question that everybody wants to know so they can give some size to the program. I think what I can tell you is that it's a fair amount of our program that would be eligible for repowering. I'd say that anywhere from maybe 3 gigawatts to 4 gigawatts are potential repowering candidates. But what we say internally and what I want you and others to understand is, each one of these repowering projects that we're looking at is a whole new project, right? I mean, we've got to look at has the permitting changed, have the environmental regulations changed, what do the land leases look like, what discussions can we have with the customers, what do the old PPA's look like? If it's a merchant project, how comfortable are we with revenues and/or hedges that we have to take a look at. So, we've actually got a very large spreadsheet where we're looking at these projects, but I can tell you that in detail at this point, we've only looked at a very small amount of the projects that we feel comfortable with and most of what we are seeing, again, it's still very early because all of these things are just like their own mini projects. Most of what we're seeing, we think would likely go COD in 2019 and 2020. There is obviously going to be a portion, if they work that are going to go in 2017 and 2018, and unfortunately it's going to probably be dribs and drabs like you have today when we announced these 327 megawatts, but a large portion of these look like, if they are going to make sense would be in 2019 and 2020. So a very small piece and we're very happy to announce it today, because it was – certainly, it wasn't something that we were thinking about six months ago, but you'll probably continue to hear from us that, hey, this works and this doesn't work and so on.
Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's very helpful color, Armando. Thank you. And then just shifting over to natural gas infrastructure you've had good success in growing the business. From here, when you look out at additional growth opportunities in natural gas infrastructure, are there logical growth opportunities that you really need in the near term or should we be thinking that, while it's a great opportunity, it's going to progress over an extended period of time. In other words, is there – are there actionable additional options that you see and do you also see sort of a real need in the near term or is this just something that's broader, it's not quite as near term, in terms of up year thinking around growth?
Armando Pimentel, Jr. - President & Chief Executive Officer, NextEra Energy Resources, LLC: Yeah. So, I think a couple points on that. First, when we acquired the NET portfolio last year in Texas, one of the things that we said was, we were happy to be acquiring an interstate portfolio of pipelines and we thought it would give us opportunities to expand in that area. And that we believed that the additional gas requirements coming out of Mexico would present us opportunities down the line. We still think that, it's what moves or transactions that get negotiated with what our friends, staff or the board are always take a little bit longer than what we would expect, but we still think that there are opportunities. I wouldn't want you to believe that they are $2 billion type opportunities, like we did in NET Mexico. I think these are growth opportunities in Texas and maybe to the Mexican border and we're excited about that. Beyond that, we're doing Greenfield work. It's very difficult for us to be able to participate in the, what I'll call, the acquisition market, which is primarily the MLPs participate in. So, we are doing some Greenfield work along with the small business that we have in the upstream and we are certainly hopeful that from now through 2020 that we would have another project, another pipeline project to be able to announce. But we – I wouldn't say that there's anything in the near term that we would be announcing.
Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jonathan Arnold from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, sir. Your line is open.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, guys.
John W. Ketchum - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Good morning, Jonathan.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Just a follow-up on the repowering. I recall at one point, you indicated that you might need to get some incremental IRS guidance around 80/20 calculations and the like. Do you have that in a form that you feel is financeable currently or is there still a need to sort of firm up the structure?
Armando Pimentel, Jr. - President & Chief Executive Officer, NextEra Energy Resources, LLC: So, Jonathan, it's Armando. We did get some incremental guidance from the IRS on repowering a couple of months ago. The reason that we felt comfortable announcing the 327 megawatts on repowering today is we think that it at least this project and the calculations, the fair value calculations that we have to do on the project fit squarely into that guidance. I will tell you that, as I mentioned before that each one of these are mini projects. It would be helpful, obviously to get additional guidance from the IRS to make the entire portfolio that I talked about before work, but there is a good bit of the portfolio that we're comfortable with the guidance that we have received to date and that in and of itself would not to be what holds it up.
John W. Ketchum - Chief Financial Officer & Director: And one thing to add to that, Jonathan, we have secured tax equity financing for the two projects that we announced on this morning's call.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. That was going to be my follow-up, but are you pursuing incremental clarification or not?
John W. Ketchum - Chief Financial Officer & Director: We don't need any incremental clarification at this point, Jonathan. It would be, we're not the only ones that are thinking about doing something like this, so there are others that are interested, I think potentially in getting additional clarification. But for the projects, at least for the initial projects that we're looking at, the guidance that we have received is good enough. Again, I want to make sure that everybody understands. These things are all mini projects in and of themselves, the IRS piece is just one small bit of what we need in order to make the conclusion that we would move forward.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. And then on, just as we look at the slide with the detail around the NextEra Energy Resources, EBITDA and cash outlook, it seems to be in a bit of an uptick from first quarter in the financing costs line, can you give us a sense of what's driving that is it incremental project financing, is it higher cost, is it...
John W. Ketchum - Chief Financial Officer & Director: We just had some incremental refinancing activity that was impacting that line, Jonathan.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. That's all I got. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Paul Zimbardo from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Paul A. Zimbardo - UBS Securities LLC: Hi. Good morning. Yet another follow-up on repowering, can you provide a little additional color on how you selected those specific 327 megawatts out of the portfolio? And what kind of return profile you're expecting on that investment?
John W. Ketchum - Chief Financial Officer & Director: I feel comfortable giving you little bit more detail on the former, but at this point, I think it's too early to talk about the returns although I can at least tell you on the returns that, we wouldn't be making investment returns on repowering projects, if they weren't at least as good as the returns that we're getting on new projects. But – so we – take a look at our portfolio, obviously if a project does not have production tax credits, it's no longer generating production tax credits that makes it a pretty good candidate for repower. Why? Well because if you're going to repower before the production tax credits have expired, you're going to lose some of those older production tax credits in order to gain new production tax credits. Having said that, projects that still have one year or two years of production tax credits that they're generating, they may also work. I'm not saying that they would work, but you've got to understand whether giving up two years of production tax credits and getting another 10 years of production tax credit as an example in 2020 when you can get 100% PTC's for 10 years, whether that makes sense or not. Projects that -- what we call the convertible investment tax credit, what other people call the 30% grant from the government, those never had production tax credits, those are actually decent candidates. There's not a big difference, whether a project was or is tax equity financed or is project finance. So, either one of those would work. There's not a big difference, whether a project has already been dropped or sold to NextEra Energy Partners certainly NextEra Energy Partners, could do this. Projects that are merchant have one less difficulty associated with them that is, you don't have a PPA counterparty to have a discussion with. Having said that, we have had discussions with a couple of PPA counterparties, and they love the idea of repowering. I am not suggesting that those are going to get repowered, but at least the discussions that we've had, those customers love the idea that they can get repowered turbine. So that's kind of the things that probably the most important things that we're looking at in order to determine if something, somebody's a candidate. But the bottom line Paul is that the return thresholds are at least equivalent if not slightly better than what we currently see in our existing – in our new build portfolio that's why repowerings are so attractive.
Paul A. Zimbardo - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you. That's great. And then one other question at the utility after the Supreme Court decision for the gas rate basing, do you still think this is an opportunity you're going to explore and if so, what are the next steps from a regulatory or legal standpoint?
Eric E. Silagy - President & Chief Executive Officer, Florida Power & Light Company: So, this is Eric Silagy. From the reserve standpoint, I mean, the court was clear that the CSE would have to go back and review this, they feel as if actually to do that they would need the authority, so that would really require legislative action and whether or not that occurs or not remains to be seen. We clearly see a lot of value in the opportunity at the utility to be able to have predictability and some certainty a little more around gas supplies from a pricing standpoint. And that's what this is the physical hedge. And so, we think there's a lot of value there for customers. But the commission thought that unanimously and the court made it clear that they weren't really passing a judgment on whether or not it was a good idea, just that they didn't believe that the commission had the authority under the current legislative construct to be able to make that ruling, and so in a way they were encouraging that to be clarified due to legislative process.
Paul A. Zimbardo - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you very much.
Eric E. Silagy - President & Chief Executive Officer, Florida Power & Light Company: You're welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from Shahriar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Hi, everyone.
John W. Ketchum - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Good morning, Shahriar.
Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC: So, really robust spending outlook at resources and then it doesn't appear that you are sort of putting any strain on your credit metrics in the near term. But, can you kind of touch on, if you sort to see any mismatches between the future cash flows and the current development spend, say post 2017, 2018 and then sort of are these merchant, potential merchant asset sales are levered to mitigate any potential for right sizing?
John W. Ketchum - Chief Financial Officer & Director: No. Don't see any mismatches. We continue to grow cash flow through new investments. We do run at a free cash flow deficit, which we finance with – from third-party sources. We are careful in terms of how we balance our growth going forward. We have very attractive investment opportunities at Florida Power & Light that we continue to execute on and continue to see good opportunities at Energy Resources. But as we said in the prepared remarks, we do continue to look at recycling activities as a way to become more long-term contracted and rate regulated, which is consistent with our strategy.
Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Got it. Thanks. That's helpful. And then just on the reserve amortization balance, any sort of expectations how much we could carry into 2017 if it's extended as part of the negotiation process in the current filing or do you expect to fully recognize it by yearend?
John W. Ketchum - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Yeah. It's a feature of our settlement agreement that we executed back in 2012. So, the plan would be to use what we currently have.
Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Okay, got it. And then, just lastly on the Woodford Shale investments, what are you (46:20-46:25) come from an asset standpoint?
John W. Ketchum - Chief Financial Officer & Director: I am sorry, Shahriar. Can you repeat the question?
Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Sorry about that. So, just on the Woodford Shale investments, what are you exactly unwinding from an asset standpoint or are these just – are these just contracts?
John W. Ketchum - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Yeah. All we're unwinding is basically the fuel costs that was passed onto customers and since natural gas prices have come down just a hair, the differential between what was rolled through in the fuel charge and what the market price for natural gas is, that's really the unwind of the charge. However, I do want to say that – in our current natural gas price environment, this would have been a great time to be layering into further investments. So, it's unfortunate with the Supreme Court decision.
Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Exactly. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Ridzon from KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Good morning.
John W. Ketchum - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Good morning Paul.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Can you give a sense of as you look at these repowering opportunities kind of a dollar per megawatt kind of bookings around that?
John W. Ketchum - Chief Financial Officer & Director: It's going to, I mean, it is going to depend. I will give you an assessment though on the ones that we announced today. The CapEx investment is roughly $250 million. That's not to say that it's going to be the same metric for every project that we could do, but for this one is roughly $250 million.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Is part of the economics that make these at least as good as new development the fact that you don't have to do the siting and permitting, how big a component is that?
Armando Pimentel, Jr. - President & Chief Executive Officer, NextEra Energy Resources, LLC: As I mentioned before, these are all mini projects. I mean you are going to – in some cases, you are going to have to re-permit, in some cases you're going to have to relicense, in some cases you are going to have to have discussions with the county or the state or I mean – you are going to have to deal with birds and bats and bees and you know all of the things that we generally deal with. We've got to take a look at these as a brand new development. Some states are actually easier to get some things down than others, but that's the case for repowering the same as for new investments.
James L. Robo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Paul, let me just add because we have had a lot of questions on, this is Jim – on repowering this morning. I just want to reemphasize something that Armando said. We are not trying to be cagey in terms of how we are answering all these questions on repowering. I mean, the reality is we have several gigawatts, as Armando said, of opportunities but each project is a completely new development and it's a little bit easier than the old development because you don't have to go get land leases and you have a transmission interconnect, but there is still an enormous amount of work that needs to get done for each of these projects. So, we have a big team on it, we're running through it. It is as Armando said, if it's up to – if it's as many as 3 gigawatts or 4 gigawatts, that's a tremendously big opportunity for us and we're as always on something that we've been work – the other point I just wanted to make is, we've been working on it for about 90 days. And so, we are – I think we've made tremendous progress actually in the last few months on it and we're going to have more clarity on each of the calls that we do as we go forward. It is becoming clear though for sure that most of the activity is going to be 2018, 2019 and 2020. And so, really as you think about this for us, it's a terrific driver of growth post 2018 as we think about the longer term future for the company.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And is this 327 megawatts – a megawatt-per-megawatt displacement or is this adding more megawatts with bigger towers?
Armando Pimentel, Jr. - President & Chief Executive Officer, NextEra Energy Resources, LLC: No. This is not a megawatt-per-megawatt – well, let me put it to you this way. We are taking turbines down that have 327 megawatts of capacity and we're putting refurbished turbines up that have 327 megawatts of capacity. Does that answer your question?
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Yes, yes. It does.
Armando Pimentel, Jr. - President & Chief Executive Officer, NextEra Energy Resources, LLC: Okay.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And then you kind of alluded to the fact that the second half growth is going to come in the fourth quarter. Are we expecting a down third quarter?
Armando Pimentel, Jr. - President & Chief Executive Officer, NextEra Energy Resources, LLC: Yeah. We're expecting most of the growth to have occurred in the first half of the year versus the second, and that's really due primarily just to some timing issues around some tax items and then Lamar, Forney sale having hit in the second quarter as well. Those are really the two primary factors.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then in Florida, is there a specific time period carved out for settlement discussions?
John W. Ketchum - Chief Financial Officer & Director: No. There is – there is not. I mean, obviously we're going to be going into hearings starting on August 22. Those are scheduled to last for two weeks. And so we're open to settlement discussions at any time. But realistically, I mean timing becomes more challenging as you get closer and closer to getting in the hearings, simply because everybody is gearing up and then going into the hearings.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Got it. Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Greg Gordon from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI: Thanks, actually that last question was the vast majority of my question. I was wondering if at this point, there would be any specific filings that talk about the concept of retaining or changing the current return on equity construct. In the last several rate deals you had, the commission has been consistent in giving you sort of a target base ROE with a wide band of opportunity and risk. Do you expect that you'll have the same framework going forward or is there potential for a change in that framework? And if so, when we will get a sense of where the different parties are on that issue?
Eric E. Silagy - President & Chief Executive Officer, Florida Power & Light Company: Yeah. So, this is Eric. We filed our case and we don't expect any change in the longstanding commission framework of having 100 basis points on either side of a midpoint. That's really designed for again to, for the commission to be able to have predictability and stability and not having people coming in for rate cases in the short-term basis. So, I – there is no indication that that's going to change that's something that – that the commission has had in place for awhile and it's effective for all IOUs in Florida.
Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI: Great. And has there been any testimony filed on cost of capital yet?
Eric E. Silagy - President & Chief Executive Officer, Florida Power & Light Company: Well, we had lots of testimony filed, absolutely. So, the commission has received our direct testimony and then as John said, we're in the process now of filing, preparing our rebuttal testimony, and that will go in on August 1.
Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI: Great. And is there – I know that there has been a lot of, I doubt you're going to answer this question, but someone has to ask it. Is there anything that you can say publicly about the Oncor process?
James L. Robo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I know you had to ask it and I'm not going to comment on it. Thanks.
Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI: Okay. Thank you guys.
James L. Robo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead sir.
Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC: Yeah. Hi, just a follow-up on the rate case. What's your views on the chances of settling the case? Is it kind of the same as when you filed earlier this year or has anything changed in your views on settlement chances?
Eric E. Silagy - President & Chief Executive Officer, Florida Power & Light Company: Yeah. Steve, this is Eric. It's always hard to predict. We've got a number of interveners. We've made it very clear that we're always open to having these discussions. We think settlement is a good thing just generally as long as it's fair for all the parties. But we just finished nine quality of service hearings where the commission went around the state throughout our territory. The response from customers was overwhelmingly very positive. We've filed a very strong case. I feel really good about where we stand from a perspective of we've had the lowest bills in the state for six years in row and the highest reliability and best customer service and emissions profile that's the cleanest in the Southeast U.S. And I think the commission recognizes that. So, we're prepared to go into hearings and to finish the case out, but if we can have a settlement, that's great. It's just hard to predict because it's not dealing with one counterparty, it's multiple counterparties.
Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC: Okay, great. And then just maybe just clarify on kind of financing plan, I know you guys have talked about really looking to limit any equity needs for your plan, particularly near-term. Just do you continue to think you can kind of fund the plan pretty much without additional equity?
John W. Ketchum - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Yeah, we do for 2016. With of the sale Lamar, Forney generating about $450 million in net cash proceeds, I think that puts us in pretty good position for the balance of this year, we have a few more capital recycling opportunities that we're looking at as well. And for 2017, we're really not going to give any guidance around that until we get through the rate case.
Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC: Okay. Thank you.
John W. Ketchum - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Thank you, Steve.
Operator: We will now take our final question from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, guys. Easy I think easy question and likely for Eric. Eric, can you talk about the issues surrounding Turkey Point, especially with the lawsuit that's been filed and just how do you think about the cost of remediation, how do you think about the kind of the timeline for that and then obviously some of the complainants – some of the complainants are talking about the potential for cooling towers, what you kind of think about the likelihood and need for that would be as well?
Eric E. Silagy - President & Chief Executive Officer, Florida Power & Light Company: Yeah, Michael, Turkey Point, it's a – there are a lot of parties obviously who have jumped in on this for a whole variety of reasons. The reality is that the cooling canals have operated as designed, there is no impact on the local drinking water wells, there is no pollution going into Biscayne Bay. There is a concentration of salt water below the cooling canals that has moved to the limestone, that was frankly anticipated during the original design of the canals. Everybody knew that was going to occur it was a question of how far. We've now identified because we now have the technology to identify, how far some of that salt water has migrated and we have a plan in place working very closely with the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, Miami-Dade authorities and others to mitigate that plan. It's fact-based, it's science-based, we're going to undertake that, we are waiting on permits to be able to do some of that. And the costs associated with that is the costs associated with operating the plant. And so, we fully expect that to be recovered through our environmental cost recovery.
Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thanks, Eric, much appreciated.
Eric E. Silagy - President & Chief Executive Officer, Florida Power & Light Company: You're welcome.
Operator: Thank you very much everyone. That will conclude today's conference call. Thank you very much for your participation ladies and gentlemen, you may now disconnect.

===== 2016 Q1  (2016-04-29 00:45:00) =====
Executives: Amanda Finnis - Director Investor Relations John W. Ketchum - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP-Finance James L. Robo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer Armando Pimentel - President and Chief Executive Officer, NextEra Energy Resources, LLC
Analysts: Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI Abe C. Azar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Matt Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Amanda Finnis. Please go ahead.
Amanda Finnis - Director Investor Relations: Thank you, Priscilla. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter of 2016 combined earnings conference call for NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. With me this morning are Jim Robo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; John Ketchum, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; Armando Pimentel, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources; and Mark Hickson, Senior Vice President of NextEra Energy, all of whom are also officers of NextEra Energy Partners; as well as Eric Silagy, President and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light Company. John will provide an overview of our results and our executive team will then be available to answer your questions. We will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release, in the comments made during this conference call, in the risk factor section of the accompanying presentation, or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found on our website, www.nexteraenergy.com and www.nexteraenergypartners.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. Today's presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of certain non-GAAP measures to the closest GAAP financial measure. With that, I will turn the call over to John.
John W. Ketchum - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP-Finance: Thank you, Amanda, and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners are off to a strong start to 2016 and they made excellent progress against the core focus areas that we discussed on the last call. NextEra Energy's first quarter adjusted earnings per share grew approximately 10% and the company continued to deliver significant growth in cash flow from operations against the prior year comparable quarter, reflecting strong performance of both Florida Power & Light and Energy Resources. NextEra Energy partners grew per unit distributions by 55% versus the prior year comparable period and continued to add to the solid run rate with which it entered the year by successfully acquiring two new wind projects. At Florida Power & Light growth was primarily driven by continued investment in the business to further advance our long term focus on delivering outstanding customer value. Our major capital initiatives remain on track and I am pleased to report that the New Port Everglades Next Generation Clean Energy Center entered service on April 1 on budget and two months ahead of schedule. In addition, construction began on FPL's three 74.5 megawatt utility scale solar PV projects. As a reminder, these projects leverage existing infrastructure in prior development work that cost effectively add more solar to our system and upon expected delivery by the end of the year will roughly triple FPL's solar capacity. Not only will these projects help to further diversify FPL's fuel mix, but they also demonstrate FPL's commitment to providing customers low cost and reliable clean energy solutions. Due in part to our efforts to modernize our existing generation at the end of the first quarter, we were pleased to deliver FPL's fourth rate decrease in the past 16 months. On March 15, we filed our formal request for rate relief beginning in January 2017 following the expiration of our current settlement agreement. Our 2017 to 2020 base rate proposal is largely consistent with what we indicated in the test year letter. Under this proposal, combined with current projections for fuel and other costs, FPL estimates its typical residential bill in 2020 will still be lower than it was in 2006 and will remain among the lowest in the state and nation based on current bill comparisons. At Energy Resources contributions from continued growth in our contracted renewables portfolio and investments in natural gas pipelines grow strong financial results for the quarter. Since the last call, the team signed additional PPAs for additional for approximately 250 megawatts of U.S. wind for post 2016 delivery and closed on an acquisition of a 100 megawatt wind facility located in New Mexico that began operations in 2009. We continue to believe that the fundamentals for the North American renewables business have never been stronger, and I will provide an update on our latest expectations for a long-term contracted renewables development program later in the call. In addition, earlier this month, we increased our participation in the Sabal Trail natural gas pipeline project through the incremental purchase of a 9.5% equity interest from Spectra Energy, bringing our total ownership share from 33% to 42.5%. At NextEra Energy Partners, we continue to believe that a strong sponsor with a highly visible runway for future growth is a core driver of the NEP value proposition. During the quarter, NEP completed the acquisition of the Seiling I and II wind projects from Energy Resources, totaling approximately 300 megawatts. Despite challenging capital market conditions, the full block of limited partnership units to be issued in connection with the acquisition was purchased by the underwriter at the time of announcement. The overallotment option was also subsequently exercised in full. In addition to NEP's success in accessing the equity markets to continue to grow its renewables generation portfolio, first quarter operating performance was excellent, and cash available for distribution was slightly better than our expectations. The NEP Board declared a quarterly distribution of 31.875 cents per common unit, or $1.275 per common unit on an annualized basis, up approximately 55% over the prior year. At this early point in the year, we're very pleased with our progress of both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. Now let's look at the results for FPL. For the first quarter of 2016, FPL reported net income of $393 million or $0.85 per share. Earnings per share increased $0.05 or approximately 6% year-over-year. The principal driver of FPL's earnings growth was continued investment in the business. Average regulatory capital employed grew roughly 8.6% over the same quarter last year. During the quarter, we invested roughly $1.2 billion of the approximately $4.1 billion to $4.3 billion of capital expenditures that we expect for the full year. Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.5% for the 12 months ending March 2016. As a reminder, under the current rate agreement we record reserve amortization entries to achieve a pre-determined regulatory ROE for each trailing 12 month period. We entered 2016 with a reserve amortization balance of $263 million, and we utilized $176 million during the first quarter, in order to achieve the regulatory ROE of 11.5% that I just mentioned. This was slightly better than our expectations, leaving us with the balance of $87 million, which can be utilized in the remainder of 2016. Since the start of our current rate agreement in 2013, we have utilized the larger proportion of reserve amortization during the first half of the year due to the pattern of our underlying revenues and expenses and we expect this year to be no different. We continued to expect to utilize the balance of the reserve amortization this year to offset growing revenue requirements due to increased investments. We expect the reserve amortization balance along with our current sales, CapEx and O&M expectations to support regulatory ROE in the upper half of the allowed band of 9.5% to 11.5% in 2016. As always, our expectations assume among other things normal weather and operating conditions. The Florida economy remained solid. A focus on economic development and an overall improvement in the business climate continued to encourage business expansion and additional hiring. Florida's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate drop to an eight-year low of 4.9% in March down 0.7 percentage points from a year earlier and below the national rate of 5.0%. Over the same time period, the number of jobs increased 2.9% and over 1 million jobs have now been added in the state since December 2010. As an indicator of new construction, new building permits have shown strong growth and the most recent reading of the Case-Shiller Index for South Florida shows home prices up 6.0% from the prior year. Overall, Florida's economy continues to grow, and the latest readings of Florida's consumer confidence remain near post recession highs. During the first quarter, FPL's average number of customers increased by approximately 64,000 customers from the comparable prior year quarter, which had a favorable impact on sales of 1.3%. However, customer growth was more than offset by a 1.4% decline in sales due to mild weather during the quarter. Also, compared to the same quarter last year, underlying usage per customer declined 0.4% on a weather-normalized basis. Looking ahead, we continue to expect year-over-year weather-normalized usage per customer to be between flat and negative 0.5% per year. After accounting for these effects and the impact of a leap year day in 2016, first quarter retail sales increased 0.4% year-over-year. The number of inactive accounts reached its lowest levels in more than a decade and stronger growth in new service accounts during the quarter reflected healthy levels of construction. As I mentioned earlier, on March 15, we submitted testimony and detailed supporting information for FPL's 2016 base rate proceeding. The overall proposal for our 2017 through 2020 base rate plan is substantially consistent with the test year letter filed in January. We are requesting a base rate adjustment of approximately $866 million starting January 2017, $262 million starting January 2018 and $209 million upon commissioning of the Okeechobee Clean Energy Center in mid-2019, with no base rate adjustment in 2020. We are proud to offer customer service that ranks among the cleanest and most reliable in the country with typical residential bills among the lowest in the nation and 15% lower than 2006. The four-year base rate plan has been designed to support continued investments in long-term infrastructure and advanced technology which improves reliability and helps keep customer bills low. With the proposed base rate adjustments and current projections for fuel and other costs, we believe that FPL's typical residential bill will grow at about 2.8% per year from January 2016 through the end of 2020, which is about the same as the expected rate of inflation. The Florida Public Service Commission has established a definitive schedule for this proceeding, beginning with quality of service hearings in June, rebuttal testimony from interveners and staff in July, rebutting testimony from FPL in August, and technical hearings in late August and early September. The proceedings would conclude in the fourth quarter with the staff recommendation and commission rulings on revenue requirements and rates. The nearly 9,000 employees of FPL have worked hard and thoughtfully for many years following a consistent strategy that has led to FPL's current combination of low bills, high reliability and excellent customer service. The 2013 settlement agreement has benefited customers by eliminating the need for a general base rate increase for four years, while at the same time providing stability and certainty around the level of customer bills. We look forward to the opportunity to present our case to the commission this summer and our focus will be to pursue a balanced outcome that supports continued execution of our successful strategy for customers. As always, we are open to the possibility of resolving our rate request through a fair settlement agreement. Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported first quarter 2016 GAAP earnings of $224 million or $0.48 per share. Adjusted earnings for the first quarter were $306 million or $0.66 per share, while adjusted earnings per share increased approximately 14% year-over-year. As a reminder, our reporting for Energy Resources now includes the results of our natural gas pipeline projects, formerly reported in the corporate and other segment. While our first quarter 2015 results have been adjusted accordingly for comparison purposes, the effects are minimal due to the prior immaterial contributions from these projects during early stages of development. Energy Resources' adjusted earnings per share contribution increased $0.08 from the prior year comparable quarter. New investments added $0.14 per share, including $0.10 from continued growth in our contractor renewables portfolio. These results reflect approximately 1,840 megawatts of new renewables projects placed into service during or after the first quarter of 2015. New investments in natural gas pipelines added $0.04 per share, reflecting the net addition of the Texas pipelines acquired by NEP, as well as continued development work on the Florida pipelines and Mountain Valley project. Wind resource was 98% of the long-term average, versus 87% in the first quarter of 2015, and this favorable comparison was the principal driver of increased contributions from existing assets of $0.04 per share. Partially offsetting these results were lower contributions from our customer supply and trading business, increased corporate expenses primarily related to growth in the business, and the impact of share dilution. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide. At Energy Resources, we continue to believe we are well positioned to capitalize on one of the best environments for renewables development in recent history. Over the last decade, we have invested roughly $23 billion in wind and solar generation. Last year alone, the team signed contracts for a total of approximately 2,100 megawatts of new renewables projects, making 2015 our second best year ever for renewables origination performance. With these additions, along with the 100 megawatt acquisition since the last call that I mentioned earlier, our total 2015 to 2016 renewables development program is over 4,000 megawatts. This result is roughly 500 megawatts above the midpoint of the range for these years that we discussed at our Investor Conference last March, making 2015 and 2016 the most successful two-year period for renewables development in our history. Energy Resources continues to benefit from growing demand for renewables and has built what we believe, is the largest and highest quality renewables development pipeline in the space. Driving that growth is a number of favorable trends. First, Congress at the end of last year provided increased certainty of U.S. Federal Tax incentives for renewables through the extension of the 2014 Wind PTC and the 2016 Solar ITC programs over a five-year 'phase-down' period. This form of policy support has been very important over the last decade, and with the extensions, we believe that renewables are well positioned to support a higher base opportunity set, than would otherwise have been the case, not only through 2018, but into the next decade. Together with the extension, we expect that the IRS will provide start of construction guidance for both wind and solar. For wind, the guidance is expected to be consistent with and perhaps more constructive than what has previously been in place, which would support an ability to continue to offer very attractive pricing to our customers into the next decade. The start of construction guidance for wind is likely to be released by the IRS over the next few months, while solar guidance is expected to follow later on, given that the COD deadline for the first step of the phase-down of the solar ITC is not scheduled to occur until January 1, 2020. In turn, we expect the added planning stability provided by tax incentives to serve as a bridge to further equipment cost declines and efficiency improvements that will enable renewables to compete on a levelized cost of energy basis with gas-fired technology when tax incentives are phased-down. We have seen significant wind turbine efficiency improvements over the last several years and more are expected over the next few years. Likewise solar panel costs have fallen steadily, while efficiency has also improved substantially, with even more advances expected over the next few years. Solar balance of system costs are also expected to experience significant reductions during the same period. Both wind and solar are well-positioned to compete head-to-head with gas-fired generation technologies now and as we head into the next decade. Lower natural gas prices and environmental regulation are expected to continue to pressure existing coal facilities and renewables are well situated as the shift away from coal continues. Not only do wind and solar continue to benefit from cost and efficiency improvements and the economic support of tax incentives, but renewables also help customers meet both state and potential federal environmental compliance obligations. In addition, state level renewable portfolio standards are now in-place in 29 states and discussions of increase in the renewable requirements under these standards are continuing in certain of these states. Despite the stay of the Clean Power Plan by the United States Supreme Court, we continue to believe that the regulatory trend in North America will continue to be towards supporting more renewable energy. We expect resource planning activities for increasingly stringent environmental rules and potential carbon emissions regulations, whether at the state or federal level, will help further support demand. For these reasons, we expect some of our potential customers to be motivated not only by the economics in new renewables, but also by the consideration of current or potential future environmental compliance obligations such as the Clean Power Plan. Due to the combination of these trends favoring the development of new renewables, the U.S. wind and solar market is expected to grow significantly into the next decade. We will continue to leverage our core strengths in solar and wind and invest in related areas such as energy storage in order to offer our customers innovative, low-cost and high quality projects that we expect to further enhance our competitive position. We believe that the capabilities of our development organization, together with our purchasing power, scale in operations, strong access to capital and cost of capital advantage places in an excellent strategic position to capture even more opportunities going forward. In addition, we expect our development program to be further enhanced by an ability to attract new, non-traditional customers particularly in the form of commercial and industrial demand as improving renewable economics are increasingly aligned with corporate objectives to procure power from clean generation resources. Based on everything we see now, we expect to bring into service roughly 2,400 megawatts to 3,800 megawatts of new U.S. wind projects over the course of the 2017 to 2018 timeframe. The low end of that range matches what we expect to bring into service for 2015 to 2016, one of our most successful origination periods to date, and is roughly three times what we indicated at our March 2015 Investor Conference. On the U.S. solar side, the ITC extension may cause some customers to wait to sign contracts since the 30% ITC is in place for 2019. As such, we believe that a range of 400 to 1,300 megawatts is reasonable for the 2017 to 2018 timeframe. In part, this range reflects an expectation to continue to build upon our recent successes, as we've been positively surprised by the amount of demand we've seen for 2016 build. As a reminder, our 2015 to 2016 solar development program consists of over 1,300 megawatts, reflecting outstanding origination results for Greenfield and early stage development projects. However, we believe that some of this recent success may reflect the pulling forward of demand from future years. Overall, we expect a greater portion of new demand, particularly for solar to be for projects delivered in 2018 and beyond. Over the last eight years, we have successfully developed and acquired more than 880 megawatts of new renewables projects in Canada. We continue to pursue development of new Canadian solar, wind and storage projects and see potential for up to 300 megawatts of new Canadian wind development opportunities, over the 2017 to 2018 period. We are also contemplating repowering certain of our existing wind generation facilities, which would require new investments to be made to upgrade current equipment to the latest technology. On a project level basis, the incremental earnings and cash flow generation potential from these repowering investments could be similar to a new build opportunity, given that we would be targeting projects that are not generating PTCs. However, this effort is still in its early stages, and is contingent on IRS guidance that is expected to be released in the second quarter. We expect to be able to give a further update on where we are regarding this opportunity before the end of the year. Energy Resources' expectations for capital expenditures to support the 2017 and 2018 renewables development program are $7 billion to $9 billion, reflecting a mid-point of 4,100 megawatts of new projects over this timeframe. These capital expenditure expectations are roughly the same as for our record-breaking 2015 and 2016 program. While there is some uncertainty as to the timing of these new build opportunities, we expect a greater portion of new project demand and, in turn, a greater portion of our investment opportunities to be in 2018. Although, we are optimistic about the prospects for new renewables growth, it is important to remember that forecasting 2017 and 2018 origination expectations, while only a quarter of the way through 2016 is subject to a number of uncertainties, including most importantly, the tenor of IRS start of construction guidance and its related impact on the timing of customer demand. Similar to previous years, we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet with a flexible and opportunistic financing plan and a focus on capital recycling opportunities that supports our overall corporate credit position. We currently don't expect our financing plan in 2016 to require equity to support our renewables build. As we discussed on the last call, our enthusiasm about our renewable growth prospects was a major driver of the increased expectations for NextEra Energy's compound annual growth rate and adjusted earnings per share to 6% to 8% through 2018 off a 2014 base that we announced in the middle of last year. We continue to expect our renewables development program to support those expectations and our longer-term growth prospects. It is important to keep in mind that the greatest potential contribution to earnings and cash flow growth from these 2017 and 2018 development projects are for 2019 and beyond. Let me now review the highlights for NEP. First quarter adjusted EBITDA was $141 million and cash available for distribution was $38 million, up $71 million and $53 million respectively from the prior year comparable quarter, primarily due to portfolio growth. Before accounting for debt service, cash available for distribution was $112 million. New projects added $78 million of adjusted EBITDA and $55 million of cash available for distribution. After accounting for the results of new project additions, the existing assets in the NEP portfolio operated well and benefited from a year-over-year improvement in wind resource. For the NEP portfolio, wind resource was roughly 100% of the long term average versus 86% in the first quarter of 2015. Solar resource was also strong during the quarter, but the year-over-year impact was small. Adjusted EBITDA from existing projects increased by $5 million from the prior year comparable quarter. The comparable increase in cash available for distribution was slightly greater due to favorable debt refinancing activities and the timing of tax equity contributions. As a reminder, these results are net of IDR fees, which we treat as an operating expense. IDR fees increased $6 million from the prior year comparable quarter. The impact of other effects, including higher management fees and outside services are shown on the accompanying slide. Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy, for the first quarter of 2016, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $636 million or $1.37 per share. NextEra Energy's 2016 first quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $715 million and $1.55 per share respectively. Adjusted earnings from the corporate and other segment increased 1% per share compared to the first quarter of 2015. The sale of our Lamar and Forney natural gas generation assets located in ERCOT closed just after the end of the first quarter. This transaction generated net cash proceeds of approximately $456 million and a net after-tax gain on disposition of approximately $107 million that will be excluded from NextEra Energy's second quarter adjusted earnings. We expect continued opportunities to recycle capital through potential additional sale opportunities of merchant and other non-strategic assets in our portfolio. In addition, the strong renewables origination performance at Energy Resources continues to expand the pipeline of low risk, long-term contracted assets potentially available for sale to NextEra Energy Partners. Our continued focus on recycling capital at Energy Resources, whether through third-party asset sales or drop-downs to NEP, together with what we believe is an outstanding regulated opportunity set at FPL, continue to support our ability to balance growth across our two main businesses. Based on our first quarter performance at NextEra Energy, we remain comfortable with the expectations we have previously discussed for the full year. For 2016, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share at NextEra Energy to be in the range of $5.85 to $6.35. Looking further ahead, we also continue to expect adjusted earnings per share in the range of $6.60 to $7.10 for 2018, implying a compound annual growth rate off the 2014 base of 6% to 8%. As always, our expectations are subject to the usual caveats, including but not limited to normal weather and operating conditions. Turning now to NEP, the acquisition of the Seiling I & II projects during the first quarter has added to what we already considered to be a solid run rate and has further increased NEP's flexibility for the balance of the year. We expect the current portfolio post the acquisition of Seiling I & II to support a CAFD run rate of $210 million to $240 million, which is within the range of our December 31, 2016 portfolio run rate CAFD expectations of $210 million to $290 million. Due to our ability to raise approximately $287 million in equity to acquire these projects, their contribution to cash available for distribution and the success we've had under the ATM program, we now have more liquidity and debt capacity than we had coming into the year. We continue to evaluate the optimal long-term capital structure for NEP, and our current thinking is that the portfolio can support a holdco leverage ratio of approximately 3.5 times project distributions after debt service. Based on this metric, we expect our current incremental holdco debt capacity to be roughly $300 million to $400 million. As a result, we have flexibility as to how we finance our next acquisition and can be opportunistic regarding our approach to further growth opportunities for the balance of the year. We have included a new slide in the appendix to today's presentation with additional details regarding NEP's current incremental holdco debt capacity. The December 31, 2016 run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA of $640 million to $760 million and CAFD of $210 million to $290 million are unchanged, reflecting calendar year 2017 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at year-end December 31, 2016. Our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and are net of expected IDR fees, as we expect these fees to be treated as an operating expense. From a base of our fourth quarter 2015 distribution per common unit, at an annualized rate of a $1.23, we continue to see 12% to 15% per year growth in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through 2020, subject to our usual caveats. As a result, we expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2016 distribution to be in a range of a $1.38 to a $1.41 per common unit, meeting the fourth quarter distribution that is payable in February 2017. In summary, we continue to believe that NEE and NEP offer some of the best value propositions in the industry. We remain very focused on the execution objectives for the year and we're off to a good start. That concludes our prepared remarks and with that, we will now open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our first question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Your line is open.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: Hi. Good morning and congratulations.
John W. Ketchum - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP-Finance: Thank you. Good morning, Julien.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: So, perhaps first on the cadence of signing up these contracts that you just discussed. When do you expect to start seeing them come through, obviously there is a lot of work with the chop ahead of you. Is it later this year and or is that really going to be a next year event? And ultimately within that 2017, 2018 window you talk about is this largely weighted towards 2018 in service?
John W. Ketchum - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP-Finance: Yeah. Okay. So, for the contracts that we just signed, 250 megawatts, those are for 2017 delivery and then we also announced the 100 megawatt acquisition of the High Lonesome Mesa project and the acquisition has already closed for that one facility. And then for your second question Julien, in terms of how we see the shape of the 2017 and the 2018 build, I think we see more of a pull forward of demand into 2016 on solar, so more the solar activity occurring in 2018. And then with wind you know I think, relatively balanced between 2017 and 2018, but perhaps more activity in 2018.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: Got it. Excellent. And then if you can just clarify a bit your intentions here just 2016 equity needs, and then also interest still in the Oncor process or is that – is that on the back burner here?
John W. Ketchum - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP-Finance: I'll take the first one and then the second, I'll kick it to Jim. We currently don't see an equity need in 2016. Again, we announced the closing of the Forney and Lamar sale, which netted cash proceeds of approximately $457 million, which puts us in a pretty good position for the year. On the second question, I will ask Jim to answer that.
James L. Robo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: So, Julien, I am not going to comment on any individual acquisition other than to say what we've consistently said about acquisitions, which is first of all there is no imperative for us to do one. Second, that we have a pretty tight screen on what we would be willing to do and it would have to make sense both strategically for us and would have to make sense financially and would have to in our view create significant shareholder value. And I think that's kind of all that I am willing to say at this point on Oncor or any of the rest of the M&A, other than again that we will be very financially disciplined about how we approach it, and the focus is going to be on creating shareholder value.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: But to clarify, perhaps admist the balance sheet implications of the acceleration of the renewal plan, do you see this as expedited data knoll (35:57), can you perhaps comment on that angle?
John W. Ketchum - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP-Finance: Right.
James L. Robo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. So, I think, what I said about there is no imperative for us to do regulated M&A, we don't have to do it. I think is – is addresses that Julien. Obviously we've been very successful on the renewable front, but we've also been very successful on recycling capital and we're going to continue to recycle capital. We're committed to doing that and we're obviously committed to continuing to have a strong balance sheet and strong credit. So, we feel good about where we are right now and we continue to have one of the best balance sheets in the industry and I guard it pretty jealously. And we're going to continue to be focused on creating value like we have over the last decade for our shareholders.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks for being explicit. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We will move next to Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning.
John W. Ketchum - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP-Finance: Good morning, Stephen.
Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Congrats on great results. I was interested by the comments that you made in your prepared remarks on repowering of wind and you mentioned needing to get some IRS guidance. Could you speak a little bit further of what specifically you need to see from the IRS to allow you to move forward? And then, can you just speak – I know, you can't give a sense of the magnitude, but just what kinds of opportunities could then present themselves in terms of repowering, would these be for sort of new RFPs, where you could, in a low cost way compete against the Greenfield or how should we think about this opportunity?
John W. Ketchum - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP-Finance: I'm going to direct that question to Armando.
Armando Pimentel - President and Chief Executive Officer, NextEra Energy Resources, LLC: Hey, Stephen. Good morning.
Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning.
Armando Pimentel - President and Chief Executive Officer, NextEra Energy Resources, LLC: So a couple of things, like last time when the – excuse me, the PTC extension was passed by Congress. We're all awaiting guidance on, that started construction, how long out into the future can you build and still get those PTCs. In addition, it looks like – excuse me, the IRS may provide guidance on something relating to repowerings. There is no, we don't know that that's going to happen yet or not. We've talked about repowerings in the past with investors. We have repowered some of our sites in the past, we've torn turbines down and put up new turbines. What we're actually looking at is the possibility of enhancing some of our older sites and still being able to qualify for new production tax credit. So, it's difficult at this point to say how big the opportunity is, and it's actually difficult to say exactly what the IRS guidance would have to look like for us to feel comfortable. The IRS has current guidance on what I'll call if you have an old piece of equipment and you refurbished that equipment to some extent there are some cases where that new refurbished equipment could get all of the tax benefits of a new piece of equipment. And so, that guidance is already out there. How and when it might apply to what we're talking about, is something that we're interested in. So at this point, it's an opportunity. It could be a good small opportunity or it could be a significant opportunity. I think we will absolutely have more to say on this if it's a decent opportunity on the next call.
Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Very much, understood. And just shifting gears to, curious about Texas in terms of the renewables market. We've seen pretty significant growth in wind in Texas to very high levels of penetration. When you think about further growth opportunities in Texas, I was curious just first economically, how interesting is that given the next generation of turbines that we've seen? And secondly, do you see significant changes needed to the grid in order to allow more penetration, that is are we getting to levels where the grid really does need to materially change to allow for greater growth in Texas?
John W. Ketchum - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP-Finance: So for us, I think you've noticed that we really haven't had a lot of new Texas wind development over the last couple of years and that's really a result of our concern over the long-term economics of ERCOT and it's one of the reasons why we decided that the assets, the Lamar and Forney assets, were probably worth more to somebody else than they were to us. Obviously like you, we've seen a lot of folks build in Texas. I mean look it's easy to build in Texas, the permitting is favorable, the interconnections are favorable. I think you are probably right in what you're intimating that at some point in the future, there is going to have to be another wave of significant transmission build in Texas in order to accommodate new wind. But it's the other thing to look at in Texas actually Stephen is solar. We've seen and I'm sure you and others have seen that there appears to be an early wave of solar in Texas at prices that appear very attractive. And so, it's not just wind, I think Texas is also going to be a market that is going to be very favorable for construction of other renewable, including solar. So I don't want to – my comments shouldn't seem like we're not interested in Texas. We continue to be interested in development in Texas, but it's not going to be in my view as significant a part of our future investment, as it was during the 2006-2008 timeframe.
Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. We'll go now to Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI: Hey, good morning. Thank you. Can I ask another question about Texas? Just in general given the sort of the destabilization of what is happening there on the regulatory front with regard to uncertainty around how taxes are going to be calculated in the future, as it relates to the Oncor proceeding? Is that a less attractive environment for you in general for investment?
John W. Ketchum - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP-Finance: Yeah. I think the only thing I'd say about that is, there is a statute on the books currently in Texas, and other than that I am not going to comment on it.
Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI: Okay. But clearly the commissioners who are currently sitting on that PUC are creating a lot of uncertainty around the interpretation of that statute, right?
James L. Robo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hey Greg. This is Jim. I think if there was uncertainty it's been driven by the Hunt's application. I think there was some talk of doing a workshop and that workshop has been put off. And so I think depending on what happens, I think it's all going to come down to depending really on what happens with the Hunt's application, and I think that's a very specific case to a very specific situation and a very specific structure. And I'd be very hesitant to draw any conclusions about other utilities in Texas. We're not concerned for example about Lone Star.
Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI: Okay, great. That was really the gist of the question. And then the second question is with regard to the rate case. I know the numbers stand on their own in terms of the modest revenue increases that you're asking for in the context of the request, but you've said before, in multiple occasions, that you think that this case is going to be predominantly an ROE case. So has there been any – is it too early or has there been any sort of commentary from the intervener groups, the commission, the staff, around where the data is around your ability to continue to earn returns in the ranges that you currently have. Obviously your performance in the state has been excellent and that's a good reason to grant that?
John W. Ketchum - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP-Finance: Yeah, hard to disagree with you Greg on that; look, it's too early. We've – it's – we've filed our case and we're doing responses to a variety of questions and this process will take place between now and July when the case is really all filed and then we'll go from there.
Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI: Okay. So, we really won't start to see the meat of the sort of back and forth, in terms of testimony, until sort of after July?
John W. Ketchum - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP-Finance: Yeah. It will typically go into the July process and then obviously if we go into hearings that will be at the end of August, beginning of September.
Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI: Okay. Thanks, guys. Have a great day.
John W. Ketchum - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP-Finance: You too.
James L. Robo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Greg.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Abe Azar from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Abe C. Azar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning. Do you have any update on the NET expansion pipeline project, and maybe a little bit more broadly what opportunities are you seeing to add pipeline projects, so, besides the Sabal Trail announcement from this morning?
John W. Ketchum - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP-Finance: So a couple of things. NET, we're still – obviously it hasn't been a year yet since we closed it. And when we did close it, and we announced that one of the things we said is we were excited about all of the opportunities, not only what we thought were identified opportunities, but all of the unidentified opportunities, because it was a vast pipeline system inside of Texas. Since then, we've seen continued activity from the Mexican front and we are not in Mexico just to clear that point up. But from the Mexican front that they continue to import a lot of gas and have a lot of needs. That's creating opportunities, opportunities that we hope will actually turn into something for NET, because in particular, our pipes are – NET pipes are well placed in Texas to be able to provide to Mexico. In terms of the expansion projects, there were a couple of projects; there were some smaller projects that we expected to get completed during the first 12 months or 18 months. I don't know that many of those projects have fallen off the radar. As a matter of fact, there has been more projects that have been added on, what I'll call the small-scale optimization, which is good, which is good for NET. And then, there were a couple of larger expansion projects that we had until – under the terms of the agreement, until the end of this year, to figure out whether they were going to come in or not. And those appear okay at this point; one of them actually appears quite favorable. I think we're not going to know the pace of actually signing something up with, particularly with the Mexican Government isn't as quick as we would like to see. So we would like for – we'll probably see more activity and we'll have more to say towards the end of the year. There is a $200 million incentive payment to the owners – previous owners of NET, should those expansion projects come online and obviously if they don't, that saves NET $200 million. So, I think the previous owners and us are all well incented to get the expansion projects done, but it's just a little too early to figure out how we're going to do by the end of the year.
Abe C. Azar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We'll go now to Matt Tucker from KeyBanc Capital. Your line is open.
Matt Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to follow-up on the previous question on NET first. From an NEP perspective, could you just comment on how the performance has been so far relative to your expectations at NET?
John W. Ketchum - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP-Finance: Yeah, it's been right on Matt – right on expectations.
Matt Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Great. And then keeping with NEP, would you be willing to give any color on your drop down plans for the balance of the year and how you would finance drop downs? Both if you were hypothetically to do something today or in current market conditions and how you would finance in kind of an ideal scenario, if there is a difference there?
John W. Ketchum - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP-Finance: Yeah, I mean, we feel really good about where we are with NEP. As we said in the prepared remarks, a lot of flexibility for the balance of the year with the equity raise, $287 million for the Seiling I & II acquisitions, and now what we feel is available debt capacity around $300 million to $400 million, it gives us a chance to be very opportunistic about growth for the balance of the year.
Matt Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Great. And then just last one from me could you comment on what you're seeing in terms of the third-party M&A market from an NEP perspective right now? And what's NEP's appetite like right now for third-party M&A?
John W. Ketchum - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP-Finance: So there is, we've talked about the M&A market both the asset acquisition market and the small renewable developer market before, and there is quite a bit of activity in what I'll call the asset M&A market out there and we're – we look at all of those opportunities but it's really a very small percentage of opportunity that come to fruition for us. On the other larger development M&A market, I think Jim has commented before that there is very few players that we would be interested in, only because the way that they put deals together and the way they manage their projects is a little different than us. And so, I wouldn't really expect, at least in the near-term, for us to be doing any significant acquisitions at NEP.
James L. Robo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: The only thing I would add is, that we have such a massive pipeline of projects at NEER that can be dropped down into NEP, that there is not a huge need for us to be looking at third-party acquisitions. And frankly, our focus remains at NEER on great renewable development work and on creating an even more massive pipeline of things that we can drop down into NEP this year and going forward.
Matt Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, guys.
John W. Ketchum - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP-Finance: Just adding on also to what Jim said about the portfolio available at Energy Resources, if you exclude the 2015-2016, we got about 12 gigawatts. We have another 4 gigawatts on for 2015-2016, and then for 2017-2018 if we're successful in hitting the midpoint of the 4,100 megawatts I mentioned before, by the end of 2018, you are right around 20 gigawatts. So puts us in great shape from a NEP perspective.
Operator: Thank you, and this does conclude our question-and-answer session and our conference today. We'd like to thank everyone for joining us. You may disconnect your line at anytime.

With that, I will turn the call over to John.
John Ketchum : Thank you, Amanda and good morning everyone. Both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners enjoyed strong fourth quarters and ended 2015 with excellent results. NextEra Energy achieved full year adjusted earnings per share of $5.71 which was a penny higher than the upper end of the range we discussed going into the year and up 8% from 2014. We also experienced double digit growth in operating cash flow and continue to maintain our strong financial position and credit profile. NextEra Energy Partners successfully executed the acceleration of its growth plan despite the challenges of difficult capital market conditions in the second half of the year and grew its fourth quarter distribution per unit by 58% versus the comparable prior year quarter with a distribution of $0.3075 or a $1.23 on an annualized basis.  Before taking you through the detailed result let me begin by summarizing some additional highlights. At Florida Power and Light we continue to invest in the business in 2015 with a focus on delivering value to customers. And all of our major capital initiatives remain on track. Since the last call we received Florida PSE approval of the 2019 need for a planned Okeechobee Clean Energy Center. We expect this project to further advance our focus on providing clean, reliable and cost effective energy for our customers consistent with our long term strategy. We continue to work hard at FPL to further enhance what we consider to be an already outstanding customer value proposition. Our customers enjoy electric service that is cleaner and more reliable than ever before while our typical residential customer bill is the lowest among reporting utilities in the state of Florida and is approximately 14% lower than it was a decade ago. Despite a challenging summer lightning season FPL delivered its best ever full year period of service reliability in 2015 and was recognized as being the most reliable electric utility in the nation. This was accomplished as we continued to invest to make the grids stronger, smarter and more responsive and resilient to outage conditions. Our performance is the direct result of our focus on operational cost effectiveness, productivity and the long term investments we’ve made to improve the quality, reliability and efficiency of everything we do. And 2015 was an excellent period of execution by the FPL team. At Energy Resources 2015 was an outstanding period of performance for our contracted renewables development program. New renewables project additions drove financial results while origination results for new projects to be placed into service by the end of 2016 exceeded the expectations that we discussed at our March Investor Conference. The longer term outlook beyond 2016 also continued to develop favorably. The team signed contracts for a total of approximately 2,100 megawatts of new renewables projects over the last year making this our second best year ever for renewables origination performance. We continue to believe that Energy Resources is well positioned to capitalize on one of the best environments for renewables development in our recent history. We now have greater certainty regarding federal tax incentives for renewables, as Congress took action in December to extend the 2014 wind PTC and the 2016 solar ITC programs over a five year phase down period. We expect that the IRS will provide starter construction guidance with the two year Safe Harbor period for wind and solar similar in form to what was put in place for the 2014 PTC. The certainty regarding tax incentives will provide planning stability which we think in turn will serve as a bridge to further equipment cost decline and efficiency improvements that will enable renewables to compete on a levelized cost of energy basis with combined cycle technology when tax incentives are phased down.  In the meantime with tax incentives both wind and solar will be very competitive and in addition to the favorable impact of tax policy we expect the carbon reduction requirements under the EPA's clean power plan to significantly drive demand for new renewables as we move into the next decade. Finally we expect low natural gas prices to continue to force coal-to-gas and coal-to-renewables switching, with new renewables supported by the factors I just mentioned. Driven in large part by our enthusiasm about our renewables growth prospects in the middle of last year we increased our expectation for NextEra Energy's compound annual growth rate and adjusted earnings per share to 6% to 8% through 2018 off a 2014 base. These increased expectations will in turn affect our capital expenditure plans for renewables development program which we will update on the first quarter earnings call in April. Across the portfolio both Energy Resources and FPL continue to deliver excellent operating performance. The fossil, nuclear and renewables generation fleets had one of their best periods ever with E4 or the equivalent forced outage rate at less than 1.5% for the full year. Similar to NextEra Energy NEP also delivered on all of its financial expectations, NEP grew its portfolio through the acquisition of economic interest in over 1,000 megawatts of contracted renewables projects from Energy Resources with total ownership increasing by over 1,200 megawatts and established its presence in the long term contracted natural gas pipeline space with the acquisition of seven natural gas pipelines in Texas. This acquisition is expected to reduce the impact resource variability as in the portfolio and extend NEP's runway of potential dropdown assets. All of the same factors that favor growth in new renewables for Energy Resources likewise should benefit NEP. The strong renewables origination performance at Energy Resources continues to expand the pipeline of generating and other assets potentially available for sale to NextEra Energy Partners now and in the future. In contrast to many other U-cos [ph], NEP does not have the same dependence on third party acquisitions to grow but rather can reasonable expect to acquire projects that have been organically developed by its best in class sponsor. We continue to believe that the strength of its sponsor and the ability to demonstrate a strong and highly visible runway for future growth is a core strength of the NEP value proposition which is but one of many factors that distinguish it from other U-cos. As we head into 2016 both NextEra Energy and NEP remain well positioned to deliver on their financial expectations subject to the usual drivers of variability including in particular renewable resource variability. FPL benefits from a surplus amortization balance of $263 million which is expected to position it to earn at the upper half of its ROE range while it continues to execute on its capital investment initiatives for the benefit of customers. In addition the rate case will obviously be a core focus area for FPL in 2016.  At Energy Resources the business plan is built around the contribution from new investments and executing on the development and construction of roughly 2,500 megawatts of new renewables scheduled to go commercial by the end of the year. Meanwhile NEP entered 2016 with a solid run rate and the flexibility necessary to execute its growth plans. In summary we are very optimistic about our prospects for another strong year. Now let's look at our results for the fourth quarter and full year. For the fourth quarter of 2015 FPL reported net income of $365 million or $0.79 per share up $0.14 per share year-over-year. For the full year 2015 FPL reported net income of $1.6 billion or $3.63 per share up $0.18 per share versus 2014. Regulatory capital employed grew 6.8% for 2015 which translated to net income growth of 8.6% for the full year with fourth quarter performance leading in the way. Regulatory capital employed continued to growth through the year. In additionally to being the first full quarters since the closing of the Cedar Bay transaction in September, fourth quarter results were also impacted by timing effect and a number of smaller items, including outstanding performance under our asset optimization program. As a reminder, FPL's current rate agreement provides an incentive mechanism for sharing with customers gains that we achieve in excess of threshold amount for our gas and power optimization activities. In 2014, these activities produced roughly $67 million of incremental value, of this amount $54 million was for the benefit for Florida customers. Under the sharing mechanism which only applies once customer saving exceed $46 million, FPL was permitted to record approximately $13 million of pre-tax income in the fourth quarter of 2015. Consistent with the expectations that we shared with you previously, our reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.5% for the 12 months ended December 2015. As a reminder, under the current rate agreement, we record reserve amortization entries to achieve a predetermined regulatory ROE for each trailing 12-month period. During the fourth quarter, aided by the impact of usually warm weather we utilized only $67 million of reserve amortization. This brings our accumulative utilization of reserve amortization since 2013 to $107 million, leaving us a balance of $263 million which can be utilized in 2016. In 2016, we expect to use the balance of the reserve amortization to offset growing revenue requirements due to increased investments. We expect to reserve amortization balance along with our current sales CapEx and O&M expectations to support regulatory ROE in the upper half of the allowed band of 9.5% to 11.5% in 2016. As always our expectations assume among other things normal weather and operating conditions. Fourth quarter retail sales increased 11.7% from the prior year comparable period and we estimate that approximately 9.6% of this amount can be attributed to weather-related usage for customer. On weather normalized basis, fourth quarter sales increased 2.1% comprised of continued customer growth of approximately 1.4% and increased weather normalize usage per customer of approximately 0.7%. As a reminder our estimates of weather normalized usage per customer are subject to greater uncertainty and periods with relatively strong weather comparisons like we have seen throughout 2015. For the full year 2015, retail sales increased 5.6% compared to 2014. After adjusted for the effects of weather full year 2015 retail sales increased 1.2%, weather normalized underlying usage for the year decreased 0.3% and looking ahead we continue to expect year-over-year weather normalized usage per customer to be between flat and negative 0.5% per year.  The economy in Florida continues to grow on a healthy rate with strong jobs growth reflected in consistently low rates of seasonally adjusted unemployment around levels last seen in early 2008. And over a 1 million jobs have been added from the low in December 2009, though the pace of jobs growth is beginning to slow. Leading indicators in the real estate sector continue to reflect the strong Florida housing market and the December rating of Florida's consumer sentiment remained close to post-recession highs.  Let me now turn to Energy Resources, beginning with the reporting change. We have reevaluated our operating segments and made a change to reflect the overall scale of our natural gas pipeline investments and the management of these projects within our gas infrastructure activities at Energy Resources. As you may recall our upstream gas infrastructure activities has not only better informed our hedging decisions but have also led the opportunities in gas reserves to benefit Florida customers and the acquisition development and construction of natural gas pipelines. Our reporting for energy resources now includes the results of our natural gas pipeline projects, formally reported in the corporate and other segment, while our 2014 results have been adjusted accordingly for comparison purposes, the effects are minimal due to the prior immaterial contribution from these projects during early stages of development.  Contributions from the Texas pipelines acquired by NEP in October are also included in the Energy Resources results for 2015. Energy Resources reported fourth quarter 2015 GAAP earnings of $156 million, or $0.34 per share. Adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter were $185 million or $0.40 per share. Energy Resources contribution to adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter was flat against the prior year comparable period which primarily reflects the contributions from new investments being offset by higher corporate G&A and interest expenses.  For the full year 2015, Energy Resources reported GAAP earnings of $1.1 billion or $2.41 per share. Adjusted earnings were $926 million or $2.04 per share. Energy Resources full year adjusted EPS increased $0.14 per share despite a significant headwind associated with poor wind resource versus 2014, which was largely offset by strong results in our customer supply and trading business. These improved customer supply and trading results reflect in-part a returns in more normal levels of profitability in the first quarter following the adverse effects of the polar vortex conditions in 2014. While wind resource was approximately 96% of the long-term average in 2015, other factors including and particular icing in the fourth quarter and other production losses, reduced production by another 2%. New investments added $0.31 per share, consistent with a reported change that I've just mentioned, this includes $0.04 per share of contributions from our gas pipeline projects, reflecting the addition of the Texas pipeline acquired by NEP to the portfolio as well as continued development work on the Florida pipelines in Mountain Valley project. New renewable investments added $0.27 per share, reflecting continued strong growth in our portfolio of contracted wind and solar projects. In 2015 alone we commissioned approximately 1,200 megawatts of new wind projects and approximately 285 megawatts of new solar projects. Contributions from our upstream gas infrastructure activities which declined by $0.02 per share were negatively impacted by increased depreciation expense as a result of higher depletion rates. Based on market conditions we elected not to invest capital and drilling certain wells, which resulted in our earlier recognition of income through the value of the hedges we had in place, although this helped mitigate other negative effects in 2015, including higher depletion rates, below commodity price environment presents a challenge for these activities going forward. Partially offsetting the growth in the business was a negative impact of $0.22 per share, reflecting higher interest in corporate expenses, including increased development activity in light of what we consider to be a very positive landscape for the renewable business. Results also were impacted by negative $0.06 per share of share dilution, while benefiting from the absence of charges associated with the 2014 launch of NEP. Additional details for our results are shown on the accompanying slide.  Energy Resources full year adjusted EBITDA increased approximately 9%, cash flow from operations excluding the impact of working capital increased approximately 14%. As we did last year, we have included a summary in the appendix of the presentation that compares Energy Resources adjusted EBITDA by asset category to the ranges we provided in the third quarter of 2014. As I mentioned earlier 2015 was an outstanding period of performance for new wind and solar origination, since our last earnings call we have signed contracts for an additional 206 megawatts of wind projects for 2015 delivery. With these additions we have exceeded the expectations we shared at our March 2015 Investor Conference for our 2015 to 2016 development program. The accompanying chart updates information on each of our programs now stand. We have also signed contracts in California and Ontario for storage projects to enter service in the next couple of years. Although it is early in the technology life cycle, we are successfully originating source projects that support our expectations to invest up to $100 million per year, in order to maintain our competitive position with regard to this important emerging technology.  For all the reasons, I've mentioned earlier, we continue to believe that the fundamental outlook for our renewable business has never been stronger and we are working on an update to our capital expenditure expectations for our 2017 to 2018 development program. It is important to keep in mind that because these projects drive growth upon entering commercial operation, the greatest potential benefits are to 2019 and beyond. For 2016, we believe that our development program is largely complete other than one or two additional opportunities that we're pursuing. Turning now to the development activities for our natural gas pipeline projects that are now reported in the Energy Resources segment. The Florida pipelines remain on track and we expect to be in a position to receive FERC approval early this year to support construction beginning the mid-2016 and an expected in-service state in mid-2017. As a reminder, NextEra Energy's investments in Sabal Trail Transmission and Florida Southeast Connection are expected to be approximately $1 billion and $550 million respectively. And FPL is the anchor shipper on both pipelines.  The Mountain Valley's pipeline has continued to progress through the FERC process than filed its formal application in October 2015. We continue to see market interest in the pipeline and we'll pleased to announce earlier this month the addition of Consolidated Edison as a shipper on the line as well as the addition of Con Edison Gas Midstream as a partner. We continue to expect approximately 2 bcf per day, 20 year firm capacity commitment to achieve commercial operations by year-end 2018. With the addition of Con Edison our ownership share in this project now stands at approximately 31% and our expected investment is roughly $1 billion.  Let me now review the highlights for NEP. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was approximately $135 million and cash available for distribution was $75 million. During the quarter, the assets in the NEP portfolio operated well, overall renewable resource was generally in line with our long-term expectations and the acquisitions of the Texas pipeline in Jericho were far more completed as planned. Overall 2015 was a successful year of execution against our growth objectives, consistent with our decision to accelerate the growth of NEP the portfolio grew throughout the year to support our fourth quarter distribution of $0.3075 per common unit or $1.23 per common unit on an annualized basis, up 58% against the 2014 comparable fourth quarter distribution. Also consistent with the range of expectations that we have shared, full year adjusted EBITDA was approximately $404 million and cash available for distribution was $126 million. Clearly 2015 had its challenges as well, changes in market conditions not only affected our financing plan in 2015 but also led us to pursue additional options to be more flexible and opportunistic as to how and when we access the equity markets going forward. On the last call we announced an after-market equity issuance or dribble program for up to $150 million at NEP. At the same time NextEra Energy also announced a program to purchase from time to time based on market conditions and other considerations up to $150 million of NEP's outstanding common units. During the quarter NEP completed the sale of over 887,000 common units raising approximately $26 million under the ATM program. Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy, for the fourth quarter of 2015, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $507 million or a $1.10 per share. NextEra Energy's 2015 fourth quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $530 million and a $1.17 per share respectively. For the full year of 2015 GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $2.8 billion or $6.06 per share. Adjusted earnings were roughly $2.6 billion or $5.71 per share. Our earnings per share results for the year account for dilution associated with the settlement of our forward agreement of 6.6 million shares that occurred in December of 2014 and the June and September settlements totaling approximately 16 million shares associated with the equity units issued in 2012. The impact of dilution on full year results was approximately $0.17 per share. The issuance of additional shares is consistent both with our strategy of maintaining a strong financial position and with our ability to grow adjusted EPS at 6% to 8% per year over a multiyear period. Adjusted earnings from the corporate and other segments increased $0.09 per share compared to 2014, primarily due to investment gains and the absence of debt returning to losses incurred in 2014. NextEra Energy's operating cash flow adjusted for the potential impacts of certain FPL clause recoveries and the Cedar Bay acquisition grew by 16% in 2015 and as expected we maintained our strong credit position which remains an important competitive advantage in a capital intensive industry.  At FPL we will continue to focus on excellent execution and delivering outstanding value to our customers. In addition the right case we're seeing will be a core area focus that is likely to occupy much of 2016 and I will discuss this more in just a moment. With regard to delivering on our customer value proposition and executing on our major capital initiatives of FPL we will focus on completing our generation modernization project at Fort Everglades, constructing our peaker upgrades at Lauderdale and Fort Myers and delivering the three new large scale solar projects and our other additional investments to maintain and upgrade our infrastructure. At Energy Resources growth will continue to come primarily through the addition of new renewables and continued construction of our gas pipeline projects which we expect to more than offset PTC roll off of approximately $37 million. We feel better than ever about the quality of our renewables development pipeline and as we said in the last call, over the next few years we expect to as much as double the development resources committed to our wind and solar origination and development capabilities in order to seize an even larger share of a growing North American renewables market. Headwinds could come from the potential impact of El Nino on wind resource in the first half of the year and current weak commodity price environment. With regard to weak commodity prices we evaluated our generation portfolio for markets where we expect low prices for sustained periods of time. As a result of that exercise we took steps at the end of last year to reduce approximately 40% of our merchant generation capacity by entering into a contract to sell our [indiscernible] natural gas fired generating assets located in ERCOT. Once closed the sale is expected to be slightly accretive to our EPS and credit profile and will generate $450 million in net cash proceeds that will be recycled into a long term contract renewables business. We remain well hedged through 2018 and will continue to evaluate our other merchant generating assets for potential capital recycling opportunities.  With regard to our upstream gas infrastructure business sustained weak commodity prices of course means fewer new drilling opportunities, other things equal and we have reduced our expectations of future growth from this part of the portfolio. When we elect to drill we hedge most of our expected gas and oil production for up to seven years. In cases where we have elected not to drill we have as we did in the fourth quarter liquidated the hedges that were put in place which generally allows us to recover a portion of our original investment on those wells that we had planned to drill.  At the corporate level we don't expect our financing plan in 2016 to require equity and if there would be a need we would expect it to be modest. Similar to previous years we will work to maintain a strong balance sheet with a flexible and opportunistic financing plan and a focus on capital recycling opportunities. Also as I just mentioned we plan to evaluate capital recycling opportunities within our merchant generation portfolio as we continue to execute on our strategy to become more long-term contract in rate regulated. Earlier this month, we filed a test year letter with the Florida PEC to initiate a new rate proceeding for rates beginning in January 2017, following the expiration of our current settlement agreement. FPL was finalized in base rate adjustment proposal that would cover the next four years through 2017 through 2020, while the details of the number are still being finalized. We expect a proposal to include base rate adjustments of approximately $860 million started in January 2017, $265 million started in January 2018, and $200 million upon commission of the Okeechobee Clean Energy Center in mid-2019 with no base rate adjustment in 2020. Based on these adjustments combined with current projections for fuel and other cost we believe that FPLs current typical bill for January 2016 will grow at about 2.8% roughly the expected rate of inflation through the end of 2020. When thinking about the rate case, there are four key points to keep in mind. First, we're proposing a four year rate plan which provides customers' a higher degree of predictability with regard to the future cost of electricity. Second, from the period 2014 through the end of 2017, FPL is planning to invest a total of nearly $16 billion with additional significant investment expected in 2018 and beyond to meet the growing needs of Florida’s economy and continue delivering outstanding value for Florida customers by keeping reliability high and fuel and other cost flow, while the benefits of building a stronger, smarter grade and a cleaner more efficient generation fleet are passed along regularly to customers through higher service reliability and lower bill, you must periodically seek recovery for these long-term investments supported by base rates.  Third, you may recall that FPL is required to file the comprehensive depreciation study as part of the rate case, the appreciation study to be filed with this rate case reflects the investment that FPL has made since the last study in 2009. Based on the changing mix of assets and the recoverable life span, the resulted impact of the study is roughly a $200 million increase in annual depreciation expense. Fourth, we expect to request a performance adder of 0.5% as part of FPLs allowed regulatory ROE, compared with peer utilities in the southeast and coastal U.S. FPL has the cleanest carbon emission rate, the most cost efficient operations, the highest reliability and the lowest customer bills. But an allowed ROE midpoint is below the average of those pure utilities. We believe that the proposal for a performance adder presents an opportunity to reflect FPLs current superior value proposition and encouraged continued strong performance. The estimated impact of the three base rate adjustments phased in during the four year period would total of approximately $13 per month or $0.43 per day on the base portion of a typical residential bill. FPL has worked hard to deliver service that is ranked amongst the cleanest and most reliable to the lowest cost and has made the decision to seek relief only after a thorough review of the financial projections. Since 2001, FPLs investments in high efficiency natural gas synergy have saved customers more than $8 billion on fuel, while preventing 95 million tons of carbon emissions. In addition, while the cost of many materials and products that the company must purchase in order to provide affordable reliable power have increased and the energy demand of Florida customers are growing with the projected addition of nearly 220,000 new service accounts during the period 2014 through the end of 2017, FPLs focused on efficiency and productivity that significantly lessened the bill impact. Compared with the average utilities O&M cost FPLs innovative practices and processes save customers nearly $2 billion a year or approximately $17 per month for the average customer. Through its focus on cost reduction FPL ranks best in class among major U.S. utilities or having the lowest operating and maintenance expenses measured on a cost per kilowatt hour of retail sales. In additional, while other utilities around the country are facing potentially higher cost to comply with the EPAs going power plant, FPL is already well positioned and comply with the targets in Florida.  Today, FPLs typical residential bill was about 20% lower than the stated average and about 30% lower than the national average and we expect it will continue to be among the lowest and lower than it was ten years ago in 2006, even with our requested base rate increases. We look forward to the opportunity to present the details of our case and expect to make our formal filing with testimony and required detailed data in March. The timeline for the proceeding will ultimately be determine by the commission, but we currently expect that we'll have hearings in the third quarter with the final commission decision in the fourth quarter in time for new rates to go into effect in January 2017. As always we are open to the possibility of resolving our rate request through a fair settlement. Over a period in the last 17 years FPL has entered into five multi-year settlement agreement that have provide a customer with a degree of rate stability and certainty. Our core focus will be to pursue a fair and objective review of our case that supports continued execution of our successful strategy for customers and we'll continue to provide update throughout the process.  Turning now to expectations, for 2016, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $5.85 to $6.35 and in the range of $6.60 to $7.10 for 2018, applying a compound annual growth rate of a 2014 base of 6% to 8% we continue to expect to grow our dividends per share 12 to 14% per year through at least 2018 of a 2015 base of dividends per share of $3.08.  As always our expectations are subject to the usual caveats including but not limited to normal weather and operating conditions. Before moving on let me take a moment to discuss the expected impacts on the business of the recent phased down extension of bonus depreciation. Let me start by saying that we had already assumed the extension of bonus depreciation in our 2016 financial expectations. In addition after analyzing the recent extension we do not expect bonus depreciation to impact in NextEra Energy's earnings per share expectations through 2018. At NEP as I mentioned earlier, yesterday the board declared a fourth quarter distribution of $0.3075 per common unit or $1.23 per common unit on an annualized basis representing the 58% increase over the comparable distribution a year earlier. From this base we continue to see 12 to 15% per year growth in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through 2020 subject to our usual caveats. As a result we expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2016 distribution to be in a range of a $1.38 to $1.41 per common unit.  The December 31, 2015 run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA of $540 million to $580 million, and cap fee of $190 million to $220 million reflect calendar year 2016 expectations for the portfolio at yearend December 31, 2015. The December 31, 2016 run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA of $640 million to $760 million and cap fee of $210 million to $290 million reflect calendar year 2017 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at yearend December 31, 2016. Our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and our net of expected IDRPs as we expect these fees to be treated as an operating expense. As we have said before in the long run in order for NEP to serve its intended purpose we need to be able to access the equity markets at reasonable prices. For 2016 beyond the ATM program, we continue to plan to issue a modest amount of NEP public equity to finance the growth included in our December 31, 2016 annual run rate. However we will be smart, flexible and opportunistic as to how and when we access the equity markets. If the equity markets are not accessible at reasonable prices we expect to have sufficient debt capacity at NEP that together with proceeds rates or at the market dribble program should be sufficient to finance currently planned 2016 transaction. Where conditions are appropriate one alternative would be to raise equity privately, prefunding drops before they are publicly announced. However this is just one option that we're considering and we may access the equity markets in other ways when market conditions permit. In addition we expect our drops to be smaller in magnitude in order to manage the capital required to finance the acquisitions.  As I mentioned earlier the at the market dribble program has proven to be successful as NEP raised approximately $26 million of equity during the fourth quarter and we will continue to seek opportunities to use this program to help finance potential future acquisitions. We continue to believe it is important that we remained focused on the fundamentals and given the strength of NEP's sponsor and the prospects for future renewables development the NEP value proposition which relies on projects organically developed by Energy Resources rather than third party acquisitions for growth is the best in the space.  We plan to continue to be patient with NEP and have taken the necessary steps to provide time for recovery at the equity markets. NEP benefits from a strong sponsor, de-risked and long term contracted cash flows with an average contract life of 19 years, strong counterparty credit and projects that in many cases have been financed predominantly through mortgage style financing that provides long term protection against interest rate volatility. We remain optimistic that the NEP's financing model can and will work going forward. In summary we have excellent prospects for growth. The environment for new renewables development has never been stronger and FPL, Energy Resources and NEP each have an outstanding set of opportunities across the board. The progress we made in 2015 reinforces our longer term growth prospects and while we have a lot to execute in 2016 we believe that we have the building blocks in place for another excellent year. With that we will now open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Steven Bird with Morgan Stanley, please go ahead.
Steven Bird: Wanted to just check in on the solar valid initiative, it looks like consumers for smart solar which you had supported has gotten the votes necessary. Could you just speak to the process for getting this on the ballot and just what we should be looking at going forward there?
Eric Silagy: Sure, hi Steven good morning its Eric Silagy, so the necessary votes were secured signatures, those have been verified and it’s just two tests, there is a number of votes or signature I should say and then also a number of congressional districts that seek at least half of the congressional districts, those two tests have been met. So the next step right now is at this language, consumer referred solar amendment language has to be verified by the Supreme Court as being valid to be on the constitutional ballot, that has to take place by April 1, briefs have been filed by number of groups in front of the Court. Oral arguments have not been scheduled, they’re not required actually. So the Court could possibly rule without the oral arguments, where they’ll set oral arguments being heard and then by April 1, at the latest the Court will. If the Court approves the language, it will onto the ballot for November elections. 
Steven Bird: Okay. That's very clear. Thank you and then shifting over to resources. We're obviously very happy about the expansion of the ITC and PTC. Wanted to get your sense of the state of the tax equity market given continued growth in renewable, we had heard some reports that the market is -- some of the players maybe exiting and overtime there could be a bit of a squeeze in terms of who is actually able to secure tax equity. Would you mind talking at a high level, in terms of your take on the health currently of the tax equity market and where you see that and whether or not that might be an advantage for you all given your position versus say smaller competitors?
John Ketchum: Sure Steven. Actually we see the opposite, we see the tax equity market actually strengthening. One of the benefits of having a global banking network that as we have, gives us the ability to access different tax equity providers and one of the things that we do at the beginning of each fiscal year and we just completed this process, is work on our tax equity allocations going forward. So we feel very good and to the extent that others that maybe having poor financial performance and don't have the same prospects for future growth may not have the same access to tax equity going forward that we do given the strength of our renewable pipeline and our track record which speaks for itself.
Steven Bird: Very helpful. Thank you very much. 
Operator: And we'll go next to Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Dan Eggers: Just John, going back to the bonus depreciation comment, in fact that is not early affecting any of your funding or growth expectations, can you walk us through where you guys expected to be from a tax cash payout respective and then how far into the future does that take you with the bonus depreciation to the extent [indiscernible]?
John Ketchum: Yes, we don't expect bonus depreciation really to have much of an impact as to when we become a cash tax payer and the reason for that is that at Energy Resources we use tax equity financing because we used tax equity financing it really doesn't result in that much of a deferral of our deferred tax asset balance.
Dan Eggers: And it doesn’t affect the FPL, why?
John Ketchum: Well, if you walk through the impacts on the business, at FPL what you would expect to see is, a lower amount of equity required to be put in the business because you have a lower tax liability, Energy Resources, we used the tax equity financing but on a consolidated basis at NextEra Energy the lower tax liability we have at NextEra Energy result in higher FFO to debt which gives us additional flexibility in terms of having to issue less equity and so having to issue less equity really offsets any impacts that we have at FPL and that's the reason why on a consolidated basis net-net bonus depreciation really is not expected to impact our financial expectations going forward.
Dan Eggers: Okay and I guess then we’re early on the idea of what's going to happen to the pipeline for a renewable development that in your past conversations suggest there is a lot of focus trying to jam in projects in '16 to catch the solar ITC. Are you guys having discussions right now about your shifting the timing and magnitude of the shape of when the [indiscernible] get done and given the fact that the customers have more flexibility in than?
John Ketchum: No, not the way our contractual structure.
Dan Eggers: Okay, great, thank you. 
Operator: And we'll go next to Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please go ahead.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: So, first just on the capital markets and balance sheet needs, just to be very clear about just in terms of equity expectations for this current year, I think, I heard you say, you don't really expect any at the corporate level, can you just explain upon the assumptions baked there in and specifically discuss capital recycling, I presume that equity does not presume further capital recycling and how you think about more specifically what that recycling might look like? Obviously in light of the Texas decision, is there more merchant divestment coming is what I’ve asked just kind of the follow up.
John Ketchum: In terms of our equities needs for 2016, our base case is that we're recycling opportunities available in our merchant generation portfolio that we'll continue to explore somewhere to what we do with the Lamar-Forney transaction back in 2015. We also have some renewable assets that may be rolling off of contracts that could be good opportunities as well and then we have some renewable assets on the balance sheet that we have not previously put debt financing up against that could provide additional sources of capital for 2016 offsetting what would otherwise be a modest equity needs in 2016 for NextEra Energy.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it, but just to be clear on equity here are you assuming further asset sales beyond the Lamar and Forney to make sure -- to hit that in your equity?
Jim Robo: Julian this is Jim, you know I think the way you should think about it is, everything we have is always for sale and if there is an opportunity to sell something that's accretive to the creeds or earnings going forward and makes sense from a strategic standpoint we're going to sell it. But we're also not betting that we're going to have to sell in order not to have to issue equity this year. You know, how much equity content we need in any given year is always driven by how much capital we're going to deploy, what the opportunities are, how we're doing against all of our financing activities and we have a whole host of things that we, a whole host of levers at our disposal that we go to, and obviously issuing equity is very -- and the team knows this is a very low on my list of the kind of things that we want to do, to do finance the plan. Now obviously the flip side of that is we need a strong balance sheet and we're committed to strong ratios to maintain a strong balance sheet, so you know what we said is I think very clear in the script. We said we don't believe we're going to have an equity need this year and if there is one, it's going to be very modest.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Great, very clear and then just lastly on natural gas and obviously the dip we see here, does that impact at all your rate based gas effort in Florida or your solar efforts in Florida?
John Ketchum: Well on the one hand you could say it should create more opportunities given the distress nature of that space and potential assets coming up for sale. On the other hand it does provide somewhat of a limitation in that you have to able to identify producer operators that are willing to sell, in today's lower natural gas price environment at a price that makes sense for Florida customers, but we're working hard to identify those opportunities through the FPL origination efforts.
Eric Silagy: Julian, this is Eric, I'll just add that on the three solar projects it has no impact, those are underway and remember those were advantage sites that we had because we had the property, the transmission was there and so we're moving forward with those that provide customer benefits right up front.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Great, thank you very much guys.
Operator: And we'll go next to Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research, please go ahead.
Steve Fleishman: Hi, good morning, so first just on the current renewable backlog opportunity, I know you mentioned we'll have more specifics on the Q1 call, but just could you, just give a little bit and I might have missed it in the commentary, just a little bit of a high level color on how you're looking at the extensions to the CPP kind of moving the needle on these things. I think you said like maybe more like after a big push, after '19 was that, just want to make sure I understand what you -- the high level color you gave.
John Ketchum: So Steve, I think the first thing we looked at is, if you go back over the last several years you probably had a renewable market in the US of 8 gigawatts to 9 gigawatts, it's lumpy though as you know. When we look at '17 through '20 we see a market that's probably much closer to 13 gigawatts to 15 gigawatts and there are some out there that would say that towards the latter part of the decade that that market could get up to 18 gigawatts to 20 gigawatts. So when we look at it we say well, you know gee whiz we've gotten our fair share in the past and so our expectation is to continue to get our fair share in the future. If you look at wind, on its own and by the way it’s often very difficult to separate how much of that is going to be wind and how much of it's going to be solar, although I will tell you that solar is more and more competitive the longer you go out. But if you look at the near term if you look at '17 and '18 on the wind side certainly the expectations are that there's going to be an awful lot of wind built, right, especially if the IRS comes through with what we think they're going to come through, the same interpretation of in construction as they've had before you're going to likely get a 100% PTCs for CODs on wind all the way through the end of 2018. 2017 remains to be seen whether that will be a banner year for wind or not but I think combined '17 and '18 we'll be pretty good on the wind side. Then you look at wind a little further out obviously you got CPP, we and others have provided comments to EPA on CPP, one of those comments that EPA asked for was what do we do with the clean energy incentive program right. So right now states have to have a state implementation plan that could go in as late as the fall of 2018, before that plan goes in you can't really get under the incentive plan for renewables, so that's probably a '20 to '21 billed that you see there, we're hoping that comes up a little bit, we do see CPP making a difference for wind, probably starting in '19, but certainly no later than '20. On the solar side, the way that it's been structured, you could potentially get 30% ITC on solar all the way through 2020. I'd say this over and over again in the past, we continue to be surprised by the demand for solar, out there, it’s certainly more competitive but there is lot of demand for solar. So we see fairly steady solar growth from '18 through '20. I think it was Dan asked the question before about '16 maybe go to '17, which I don't -- I agree with what John said but the point there also on solar is you may actually see a smaller '17 because still much is getting build in '16. So, is that good?
Steve Fleishman: Yes, that's helpful and just the reason you’re going to do the updated into Q1 versus now, versus later as you just have better visibility on the backlog, again to Q1?
John Ketchum: It will have -- I know that a lot of people read the CPP, we've read at 100 times, it's complicated. We want to make sure that we understand what we think it's going to happen in the market but in addition, we're talking to all of our customers and make sure that we understand what their plans are for the next couple of years. 
Steve Fleishman: Okay. One other question on the gas pipeline business, Jim, I guess, how are you thinking about -- are the projects on time, are you seeing any counterparty risk and maybe more importantly given the rest on the business just, do you see that as acquisition opportunities or stay away, to be careful, just how are you looking at what's going on in that space?
Jim Robo: We're making good progress, in terms of timing on the projects and so I feel good about on the pipeline projects, I feel good about that. There is always pressure on timing and certainly FERC has been little slower in terms of pipeline permitting and it's been historically, but we're feeling good about that. In terms of counterparty risk, obviously we feel good with our portfolio projects that vast majority of the counterparties that we have on all the pipelines across both the Florida pipelines, Mountain Valley pipeline and the Texas pipelines, they all are very strong credit worthy entities and so we don't have that counterparty risk that some of the other folks in the pipeline business do and our average contract length is quite long, it's probably close to 20 years. So, given where the market’s at, obviously there is a lot of distress in this market, we'd have interest only in pipeline with strong credit counterparties and long-term contracts. And so, if there are those that become available and there maybe some of those become available given some of the things going on the industry, we'll be interested in that, obviously we'll be disciplined as we always are vis-à-vis acquisition but it would be something that we'll look at. But I have no interest in adding anything with commodity exposure and short contracts
Operator: And we'll go next to Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Michael Lapides: Congrats on a good quarter. Two questions, one FPL related, one near, at FPL, how much of the rate increase request is related to the total change in depreciation meaning, you mentioned the D&A study and then the incremental 200 million, but we've also got the roll off of the RAG [ph] amortization, is that part of that 200 million, is that incremental to it. And then Armando if you won't mind, can you just talk about what the PTC roll off is not just in '16, but -- does that accelerate in '17m does it decelerate or stay at a constant level over the next couple of years?
John Ketchum: Okay, Michael. This is John, I will take the first one then turn it over to Armando for the second one. On the depreciation question about 200 million and the surplus amortization balance, I think the 263 that I've mentioned earlier for '16 rolls off by the end of the year as part of our settlement agreement that expires.
Armando Pimentel: And Michael, we again have to get back to everybody, obviously, it's 37 in the next year which John mentioned in the call, I don't recall what it is in the following year.
Michael Lapides: Okay and just on the FP&L question the 200 million from the D&A study, that drives part of the rate increase request, but then you had multiple years of accumulated regulatory amortization, should we assume that all of that flows back in and not just the amount for 2015 but the multiple years into depreciation at -- in 2017 and beyond at FP&L?
Jim Robo: I think the way you should think about the impacts of -- was there amortization, first of all when you do depreciation study, everything gets washed out in the study, so you're looking at things fresh, looking at the current, what we currently depreciate in terms of our ongoing depreciation expense and we do a new study and we come up with a new revenue requirement from that study. And there are a lot of puts and takes in it and you know the fact that we had some surplus amortization over the last several years has led to our rate base being a little bit higher than it otherwise would have been had we not had the surplus amortization, but actually doesn't have a giant impact on the ongoing depreciation expense in the study.
Michael Lapides: Got it, last one Jim, just curious, any thoughts on the bipartisan energy bill that's kind of weaving its way to the U.S. Senate right now? You mentioned, there were was some commentary earlier in the call about some of the investments in storage and I think there is some terms in that legislation, if it were to make its way through that would have a pretty big impact on storage on the grid.
Jim Robo: So Michael, I give the sponsors a lot of credit for working to try to get something done in this environment, that in this environment of Washington, that said I think it’s highly-highly unlikely that anything gets done this year.
Michael Lapides: Got it, thank you, much appreciated guys.
Operator: And we're out of time for questions here, thanks everyone for joining the program today, you may disconnect and have a wonderful day.

John W. Ketchum - Senior Vice President-Finance: Thank you, Amanda, and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy delivered solid third quarter results driven by new investments at both FPL and Energy Resources. Adjusted earnings per share increased 3%, or $0.05 per share, against the prior-year quarter. Along with our strong performance in the first and second quarters and excellent progress against our objectives for the full year, NextEra Energy is well-positioned to close out 2015 in the upper half of our $5.40 to $5.70 range of adjusted EPS expectations, subject to our usual caveats. At Florida Power & Light, earnings per share increased $0.02 from the prior year comparable quarter. It was a warm summer season with above-normal weather-related usage, increasing both retail base revenues and our reserve amortization balance, while allowing us to continue to earn at the upper end of our approved ROE range. We remain focused on delivering customer value through best-in-class daily operations and execution against our initiatives to drive down costs, reduce fuel expenses, and improve reliability. During the quarter, FPL filed to lower electric rates again by about $2.50 a month on average in 2016, compared with current rates. We are very pleased to be able to deliver award-winning customer service with monthly bills for a typical residential customer lower than $100, and lower than they were a decade ago. We continue to have an outstanding opportunity set ahead of us and all of our major capital projects are on track. At Energy Resources, our results were in line with our financial expectations for the quarter and Energy Resources is well-positioned to attain its full-year expectations. Adjusted EPS at Energy Resources declined by $0.04 against the comparable prior-year quarter. The core Energy Resources story is unchanged as we continue to benefit from growth in our contracted renewables portfolio. In addition, our renewables origination results remain very strong. The team signed contracts for approximately 725 megawatts of new wind and solar projects since the last call, including approximately 600 megawatts of wind for 2016 delivery. Based on everything we see now, we are on track to exceed the high end of our previously announced 2015 to 2016 wind-build range. We continue to believe that the fundamentals for the renewable business have never been stronger. NEP remains on track to meet its distribution per unit expectations of $1.23 on an annualized basis by year-end, subject to our usual caveats. Since the last call, the financing and acquisitions of NET Midstream and the Jericho wind project were completed. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA and CAFD, which did not include contributions from either of these acquisitions, were slightly below our expectations due to wind resource. Wind resource was 93% of the long-term average for the NEP portfolio, while the long-term average for the Energy Resources portfolio was slightly higher at 97% for the quarter. The NEP board declared an increased quarterly distribution of $0.27 per common unit, or $1.08 per common unit on an annualized basis. Not only do we expect to deliver on our financial expectations for 2015, but we also are well-positioned against our 2016 financial plan. At FPL, we expect to earn in the upper half of the allowed ROE band and, as we have done this year, we expect continued strong execution against our capital deployment program for the benefit of Florida customers. For Energy Resources, we expect increased contributions from new renewables to drive adjusted earnings growth. Overall, we remain very comfortable with the 2016 adjusted EPS expectations we communicated in the second quarter earnings call. Let me now take you through the details of our third quarter results, beginning with FPL. For the third quarter of 2015, FPL reported net income of $489 million, or $1.07 per share, up $0.02 per share year-over-year. Regulatory capital employed increased by 7.8% over the same quarter last year and was the principal driver of FPL's net income growth. This rate of growth in regulatory capital employed was higher than comparable measures in the first and second quarters this year and we expect another increase in the fourth quarter. As we discussed in the last call, we continue to expect the bulk of this year's earnings growth for FPL to be in the fourth quarter. Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.5% for the 12 months ended September 2015, and this remains our target for the full year. For 2016, we continue to target a regulatory ROE in the upper half of the allowed band of 9.5% to 11.5%. As always, our expectations assume, among other things, normal weather and operating conditions. As a reminder, under the current rate agreement, we record reserve amortization entries to achieve a predetermined regulatory ROE for each trailing 12-month period. During the third quarter, due to higher retail based revenues driven by weather-related usage and customer growth, we reversed $115 million of reserve amortization. As part of the Cedar Bay settlement agreement with the Office of Public Counsel, we agreed to reduce the total available reserve amortization balance by $30 million, leaving us with an available reserve amortization balance of approximately $330 million at the end of the third quarter, which could be utilized in the remainder of 2015 and 2016. We continue to execute on our overall customer value proposition by delivering clean energy, low bills, and high reliability for Florida customers. Each of our capital deployment initiatives to provide low-cost, clean energy continues to progress in accordance with our development plans. Our generation modernization project at Port Everglades is on schedule to come online in mid-2016 and remains on track to meet its budget. Development of our three new large-scale solar projects remains on schedule, with each of these roughly 74 megawatt projects expected to be completed in 2016. These projects, once complete, will roughly triple the solar capacity on our system and add to the overall fuel diversity of our fleet, which is important for FPL and its customers. As a reminder, consistent with our focus on delivering cost-effective renewables for our customers, these projects reflect specific opportunities that take advantage of the remaining 30% ITC window, while leveraging existing infrastructure and prior development work. Aside from these specific projects, utility-scale solar, which is by far the most cost-efficient form of providing renewable energy in our service territory, particularly as compared to residential roof-top applications, is becoming more cost-effective across our entire service territory. We continue to expect that there will be additional opportunities for utility-scale solar on FPL's system by the end of the decade. During the quarter, the Florida Public Service Commission issued its final order on its approval of modified natural gas reserve guidelines for up to $500 million per year in potential additional investments, which we continue to view as an important step in what we hope will be a larger program. The development team is actively evaluating new investment opportunities to lock in historically low natural gas prices for the benefit of Florida customers. Also during the quarter, we closed on our acquisition of Cedar Bay, and filed a determination of need for the approximately 1600 megawatts, $1.2 billion Okeechobee Clean Energy Center to be placed into service in mid-2019. FPL also continues to execute on its investments to improve reliability for Florida customers by upgrading its transmission and distribution network. We expect to invest approximately $3 billion to $4 billion in infrastructure improvements through 2018, with roughly $900 million of this amount being deployed this year. I am pleased to report that on a year-to-date basis, FPL has achieved its best-ever period of system reliability and is on track to deliver its best-ever reliability performance on a full-year basis. Last week, FPL won multiple national awards, including being recognized as the most reliable electric utility in the nation. Looking ahead, in 2016 we expect to deploy approximately 28,000 smart grid devices across our system as we continue to execute on our program to further improve system reliability. All of these initiatives are focused on delivering superior customer value. Our residential bills are 30% below the national average, the lowest among reporting utilities in the state, and lower than bills paid by FPL customers 10 years ago. Overall, we are extremely pleased with the execution at FPL and our relentless focus to deliver low bills, high reliability, clean emissions, and excellent customer service. The Florida economy continues to improve. The state's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in September was 5.2%, down 0.6 percentage points from a year ago and the lowest since early 2008. Over the same time period, Florida's job growth was 3%, a continuation of a five-year trend in positive job growth with close to 1 million jobs gained since the low in December 2009. Along with the strong growth in jobs, retail activity has increased markedly since the trough in mid-2009, and July retail activity grew 8.6% since last year. At the same time, the September reading of Florida's consumer sentiment remained close to the pre-recession highs. With the Florida housing sector, the Case-Shiller Index for South Florida shows home prices up 7.5% from the prior year, and mortgage delinquency rates continued to decline. As an indicator of new construction, new building permits remain at healthy levels. Third quarter retail sales were up 2.6% from the prior-year comparable quarter, and we estimate that approximately 1.4% of this amount can be attributed to weather-related usage per customer. Our weather-related retail sales increased 1.2%, comprised of continued customer growth of approximately 1.6%, reflecting the growing population of our service territory, offset by a decline in weather-normalized usage per customer of approximately 0.4%. This measurement reflects a residual from our estimation of the impact of weather. This is particularly challenging in periods with relatively strong weather comparisons such as we have had in the first three quarters of the year. However, based on the average of negative 0.3% for this reading over the last 12 months, we have reduced our outlook for weather-normalized usage per customer. Looking ahead, we expect year-over-year weather-normalized usage per customer to be between flat and negative 0.5% per year, primarily reflecting the impact of efficiency and conservation programs. As we had discussed last quarter, we do not expect modest changes in usage per customer to have a material effect on our earnings. For this year and next, any effects of weather-normalized usage are expected to be offset by the utilization of our reserve amortization and, after the expiration of our current settlement agreement, will be taken into account in our regulatory planning. The average number of inactive accounts in September declined 16% from the prior year and the 12-month average of low-usage customers fell to 7.8%, down from 8% in September of 2014. We remain encouraged by the positive economic trends in Florida and continue to expect above-average growth in our service territory. Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported third quarter 2015 GAAP earnings of $375 million, or $0.82 per share. Adjusted earnings for the third quarter were $221 million, or $0.48 per share. Energy Resources' third quarter adjusted EPS decreased $0.04 per share from last year's comparable quarter. NextEra Energy benefited from continued growth in our contract to renewables' portfolio reflecting the addition of more than 1,900 megawatts of wind and solar projects during or after the third quarter of 2014, as well as positive contributions from the customer supply and trading business in the existing generation portfolio. Wind resources were roughly 97% of the long-term average versus 95% in the third quarter of last year. Offsetting the positives, among other things, were higher interest expense due to growth in the business and higher corporate expenses due largely to timing differences and increased renewables development activity in light of what we consider to be a very positive landscape for the renewables business. Results also were impacted by share dilution and lower state and federal tax incentives versus the prior-year comparable quarter. Year-to-date adjusted EBITDA increased 9% and operating cash flow was strong. We continue to expect full-year cash flow from operations to grow 20% to 25% subject to our usual caveats. As I mentioned earlier, the Energy Resources' development team had another very successful quarter of origination activity, adding approximately 725 megawatts to our contracted renewables backlog since the last call. Let me spend a bit of time now on where each program stands. Since our last earnings call, we have added approximately 600 megawatts to our wind backlog, reflecting projects for 2016 delivery. Based on the strength of our wind development pipeline, we now expect to exceed the high end of our previously announced 2015 to 2016 wind-build range. The origination of new solar projects has also been strong. The team signed a 125 megawatt power purchase agreement for another new solar project for post-2016 delivery since last quarter's call, demonstrating once again continued demand for solar projects even after the anticipated expiration of the 30% ITC support. The accompanied slide updates information that we provided at our investor conference in March, showing our excellent progress against our objectives for the 2015 to 2016 development program. As we discussed last quarter, we are encouraged that the Senate Finance Committee passed the tax extenders package in July that includes a two-year extension of the production tax credit. Although this is just one step in the process, we are pleased with signs of bipartisan support for a potential extension. We expect to update our 2017 and 2018 wind-build estimates by our first quarter earnings call next year. Overall, we believe that the strong fundamentals for the renewables business will continue to strengthen with continued equipment cost declines, improved efficiency advancements, a potential PTC extension, and the expected demand created by the EPA's new renewables targets under the clean power plan. Let me now review the highlights for NEP. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was approximately $99 million, and cash available for distribution was $15 million. These results were slightly below our expectations for the quarter, primarily due to weak wind resource, but the portfolio remains on track to achieve the distribution per unit expectations that we have shared for the fourth quarter distribution, payable in February. Since the last call, NEP completed the financing and acquisitions of NET Midstream and the 149-megawatt Jericho Wind project. The NEP Board declared an increased quarterly distribution of $0.27 per common unit, or $1.08 per common unit on an annualized basis. Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the third quarter of 2015, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $879 million, or $1.93 per share. NextEra Energy's 2015 third quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $730 million and $1.60 per share, respectively, with adjusted EPS up 3% over the prior-year comparable quarter. As we have discussed on the prior two quarterly calls, our earnings per share account for dilution associated with the settlement of our forward agreement of 6.6 million shares that occurred in December of 2014 and the June settlement of approximately 7.9 million shares associated with the equity units that were issued in May 2012. In the third quarter, the settlement occurred for approximately 8.2 million shares associated with the forward contract component of the equity units that were issued in September 2012. The impact of dilution in the third quarter was approximately $0.05 per share. Adjusted earnings from the corporate and other segment increased $0.07 per share compared to the third quarter of 2014, due to consolidating tax adjustments, earnings that are in pipeline and transmission business and other miscellaneous corporate items, none of which were individually notable. The development of both the Sabal Trail Transmission pipeline and the Florida Southeast Connection pipeline continue to progress well through their respective processes. We continue to expect to be in a position to receive FERC approval in early 2016 to support commercial operation by mid-2017. The Mountain Valley pipeline project concluded the scoping process as part of the pre-filing procedure and filed its application with the FERC this month. The project also added Roanoke Gas as a shipper and its affiliate as an equity partner. Mountain Valley is an approximately 2 Bcf per day project with 20-year firm transportation agreements, providing NextEra Energy a capital investment of $1 billion to $1.3 billion. The project schedule continues to support commercial operations by year-end 2018. We are very pleased with our progress so far this year at NextEra Energy. As we discussed on the last call, we are in a strong El Niño cycle that tends to be correlated with below average continental wind resource. And we also know that meteorological expectations are for the El Niño phase to potentially continue through the fourth quarter and into the first quarter of 2016. Nonetheless, based on the overall strength and diversity of the NextEra Energy portfolio, we expect to end the year in the upper half of the $5.40 to $5.70 range of adjusted EPS expectations that we shared with you previously. We continue to expect NextEra Energy's operating cash flow adjusted for the potential impacts of certain FPL clause recoveries and the Cedar Bay acquisition to grow by 10% to 15% in 2015. For 2016, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $5.85 to $6.35 and in the range of $6.60 to $7.10 for 2018, implying a compound annual growth rate off a 2014 base of 6% to 8%. For the reasons I mentioned earlier, we feel particularly good about the opportunity set at both FPL and Energy Resources and are well positioned going into 2016. We expect to grow our dividend per share 12% to 14% per year through at least 2018 off a 2015 base of dividends per share of $3.08. As always, our expectations are subject to the usual caveats, including but not limited to normal weather and operating conditions. Let me now turn to NEP. We continue to expect the NEP portfolio to grow to support a distribution and the annualized rate of $1.23 by the end of the year, meaning the fourth quarter distribution that is payable in February 2016. After 2015, we continue to see 12% to 15% per year growth in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through 2020, subject to our usual caveats. Our expectations for 2015 adjusted EBITDA of $400 million to $440 million and CAFD of $100 million to $120 million are also unchanged, subject to our usual caveats. In addition, last month, we introduced run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA and CAFD. The December 31, 2015, run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA of $540 million to $580 million and CAFD of $190 million to $220 million reflect calendar year 2016 expectations for the portfolio at year-end December 31, 2015. The December 31, 2016, run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA of $640 million to $760 million and CAFD of $210 million to $290 million reflect calendar year 2017 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at year-end December 31, 2016. These expectations are subject to our normal caveats in our net of expected IDR fees as we expect these fees to be treated as an operating expense. With that, I will turn the call over to Jim.
James L. Robo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. It's been a very strong first three quarters. At both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners, we've executed well both financially and operationally, and we've had strong execution of our growth plans all across the board. At FPL, the team continues to make excellent progress against our core strategy of investing to further improve our customer value proposition. FPL has typical residential bills 30% below the national average, one of the cleanest emission profiles in America, and was recently recognized as the most reliable electric utility in the nation. As we prepare to file a rate case at FPL in 2016, I've never felt better about the quality of FPL's customer value proposition. Ultimately, as I've said before, our goal at FPL is nothing less than to be the cleanest, lowest-cost, and most reliable utility in the nation, and we're well on our way to achieving that. At Energy Resources, we've made terrific progress against our core strategy of being the world's largest generator of wind and solar energy. The fundamentals of the renewable business have never been stronger and Energy Resources continues to build what I believe is the largest and highest-quality renewables development pipeline in the space. John mentioned that Energy Resources now expects to exceed the high end of its range for 2015 to 2016 U.S. wind development that we shared with you in March. Based on the future demand we expect from the EPA's Clean Power Plan and the potential extension of the PTC, we now see opportunities to increase even further the scale of our wind and solar development capabilities in order to seize an even larger share of the growing North American renewable market. We are significantly increasing our internal resource commitment to renewables development and we expect to as much as double the development resources committed to these activities over the next few years. I'm also very pleased with our natural gas pipeline and competitive transmission development efforts. Total expected capital deployment in our pipeline business, including pipelines underdevelopment and recent acquisitions, is now approaching $5 billion. In our competitive transmission business, we expect to invest more than $1 billion by the end of the decade. Although competition is fierce for both of these businesses, customers value our development capabilities, our engineering construction expertise, and our stakeholder relationships across North America. As with renewable energy, we expect the markets for new pipelines and new transmission will continue to grow, driven in part by the emissions targets under the Clean Power Plan. As with renewable energy, we believe NextEra Energy is well-positioned to capitalize on these new opportunities. Across the board, NextEra Energy is ahead of the goals we shared with you in March. Our announcement last quarter of increased earnings per share and dividends per share expectations for NextEra Energy was a reflection of this performance and we're well-positioned to achieve these expectations. Notwithstanding recent volatility in capital markets, we continue to have confidence that the yieldco model can work and work well for a partnership like NEP that has the right structure and the support of a world class sponsor like Energy Resources, giving it access to the largest and strongest portfolio of potential future acquisition opportunities. While we need to position ourselves to work through a period of potential uncertainty and settling out, which we have done with our modified 2015 financing plan now successfully executed, in the long run, we think the capital markets' reevaluation of the yieldco space can play to our competitive advantage both at NEP and at Energy Resources. Times of challenge are often also times of opportunity. I continue to believe that the NEP value proposition is the best in the space. NEP offers investors average annual growth expectations and LP unit distributions of 12% to 15% through the end of the decade. NEP's existing cash flows are backed by long-term contracts, which at the end of the third quarter, had an average contract life of approximately 19 years and strong counterparty credits. NEP also has a portfolio that is largely insulated from commodity risk and a well-aligned incentive structure, with the sponsor owning incentive distribution rights in a significant limited partnership position in the vehicle. We're also pursuing several options to minimize NEP's need for significant amounts of public equity through 2016 to ensure that we have plenty of time for markets to settle down. We continue to evaluate the optimal capital structure for NEP as it has some additional debt capacity that can help finance future transactions, being mindful, of course, that we don't want to over-lever the vehicle. And, of course, in the long run, in order for NEP to serve its intended purpose, we need to be able to access the equity markets at reasonable prices. We plan to issue a modest amount of NEP public equity to finance the growth included in our December 31, 2016, annual run rate. However, we will be smart, flexible, and opportunistic as to how and when we access the equity markets. And to that end, I'm pleased to announce that the board of directors of our general partner has approved putting in place an up to $150 million at-the-market equity issuance or dribble program. At the same time, NextEra Energy has also authorized a program to purchase from time to time, based on market conditions and other considerations, up to $150 million of NEP's outstanding common units. The ATM program gives the partnership the flexibility to issue new units when the price supports new unit issuance, while the unit purchase program gives NextEra Energy the ability to demonstrate its commitment to the partnership by purchasing units at times when they're undervalued. We will be patient with NEP and have taken the necessary steps to provide plenty of time for recovery of the equity markets. We remain optimistic that the NEP financing model can and will work going forward. In summary, I am as enthusiastic as ever about our future prospects. FPL, Energy Resources, and NEP all have an outstanding set of opportunities across the board and we continue to execute well against all of our strategic and growth initiatives. FPL continues to have an excellent story with a growing service territory and a strong customer value offering, while Energy Resources is strategically positioned to capitalize on what is expected to be one of the best environments for renewables development in recent memory. Overall, we are well-positioned to leverage these great businesses to continue to build growth platforms to drive our growth in the future. With that, we'll now open the lines for questions.
Operator: We'll take our first question from Dan Eggers. Your line is open.
Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hey, good morning, guys. I guess just kind of the first question, Jim, following up on a couple of things you made comments on today – the doubling of development resources into renewables is a lot given where your baseline is already. Are you talking about operating expenses to try and find more projects or are you thinking about the idea of actually doubling the amount of renewables you're doing on an annual basis?
James L. Robo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: So, Dan, we would expect that for an increase in development expenses that we would get a pro-rata increase in the amount of megawatts that we will be able to develop. And so I said, up to double; we're going to be obviously smart and opportunistic about it. I think all of the things that we've said about the renewable markets – the economics are getting better; the Clean Power Plan is coming; there continues to be good federal support and the potential extension of the wind production tax credit. And, frankly, the chaos in the yieldco space creates an opportunity for us, with some of our competitors not being as well-positioned as they were four months ago, for us to be able to continue to gain share in a market – you know, last year, we gained share in the wind business. We were the number one player – we've been the number one player for many, many years, and last year we gained share. And that's – my goal for the team is to continue to build to gain share and to build profitable projects that make sense for our shareholders and for our customers.
Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): So I guess maybe extending that conversation, when you talk about the targets for NEP's CAFD run rate for next year, does the $150 million dribble equity, is that enough to get you within that band or is there an assumption that NEE is going to put more equity capital into NEP to help get into that guidance range?
John W. Ketchum - Senior Vice President-Finance: Dan, this is John. We need a minimal amount of equity for NEP next year. Obviously, the ATM dribble program would be a good start to be able to build on an equity position heading into what our growth plans are for next year. But we have a lot of levers around NEP as well. You've seen the guidance, so we have some flexibility around the capital structure. But the ATM program would allow us to get off to a start on what we see as a minimal equity need for NEP next year.
Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): And you guys feel good about hitting the increased growth rates from last year, even if NEP's at the lower end of their growth range or the equity capital markets are still stayed tight for them?
James L. Robo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: We do.
Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Our next question is from Stephen Byrd. Your line is open.
Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning.
James L. Robo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, Stephen.
Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I wanted to at a high level talk about usage of your balance sheet. You've positioned the company with quite strong credit stats and at the high end of the range for many of your ratings targets. When you think about opportunities to deploy that balance sheet at the corporate level, we saw just very recently a big utility buy a small LDC, so there are corporate opportunities versus M&A for assets versus more organic growth, and obviously it sounds like you're very bullish on more organic growth at Resources. But at a high level, when you think about all of the opportunities for deploying your balance sheet, what do you think is likely to create the most economic value for shareholders?
John W. Ketchum - Senior Vice President-Finance: Well, one, there have been a couple of deals that have gone off at pretty high multiples, and leverage has been used to finance those transactions. From our standpoint, having a strong balance sheet is key to reaching our growth objectives and we have no intention of compromising our current credit metrics. That being said, there are opportunities perhaps to optimize our existing balance sheet, and so we always look at particularly projects that may not have debt financing on them and other opportunities within the portfolio where we could optimize our current position without compromising our credit metrics.
James L. Robo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: So Steven, this is Jim, just to add to what John said. I think to use your balance sheet to lever up to acquire assets at massive premiums and transfer much of the value from that leveraging up over to someone else's shareholders, I have a hard time – I scratch my head, honestly, and I have a hard time understanding how that makes sense for the acquirer's shareholders. And so, that's not something that we would be running up and down, jumping up and down, in terms of trying to do something like that. The other thing from an acquisition standpoint, that I would say, just overall from an M&A standpoint, I would say is we have great organic growth prospects. I feel really good about our organic growth prospects. We do not have to do anything other than execute on our organic growth prospects to deliver the expectations that we've laid out to you here, and anything that we would ever do on M&A would have to be accretive to what we're telling you in terms of our expectations going forward.
Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Very much understood. That's very, very helpful. When you think about wind growth potential, obviously, we may not know the PTC outcome till very late in the year. In your dialogue with states and utilities that may go out and procure more wind, how should we likely see this unfold? Is this likely to involve very quick action by states and utilities to start to – I'm assuming that the PTC does get extended – do you think it's going to be a fairly rapid movement by states to try to take advantage of the PTC, just given that it's always uncertain how long subsidies do last, or do you think it's more of a gradual evolution throughout 2016 and 2017? How should we think about how this might actually unfold?
Armando Pimentel, Jr. - President & Chief Executive Officer, NextEra Energy Resources, LLC: Stephen, it's Armando. I think the first thing, let me just talk about what we're seeing right now. What we're seeing right now is really a significant amount of interest in the wind space to get projects signed up for next year. Some of the customers that we're signing up are very clearly telling us that they don't necessarily know where the Clean Power Plan is going to end up, but they are taking steps today in order to address what they see as potential issues that they have under the Clean Power Plan. Others are telling us that, look, we would like to take advantage now while the PTC is here because with the PTC the prices that are being offered in the market are very economic to us on a very long-term basis. When we are having discussions with customers about 2017 and 2018, there is obviously some concern as to whether the production tax credit gets extended or not in the near term. But what's encouraging is that, once you kind of get past that, it looks like that wind has a lot of opportunities, I would say, through 2020 at least, whether it's early action credits under the Clean Power Plan or whether it's, with or without PTCs, what customers are seeing as a trend to go more renewables is very positive for us. So I'd say where we sit on wind 2017 and 2018, I would expect on a combined basis to be pretty good for us.
Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's great. Thank you very much.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith. Your line is open.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: Hey, good morning.
James L. Robo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, Julien.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: So let me actually start by following up on the last question a little bit. When it comes to CPP, I'd be curious, you have this dynamic around 2020 to 2021 of early action. To what extent is that creating kind of another boom/bust in the cycle? Obviously, you got a PTC extension here, but are folks holding off to get projects qualifying for their early action program?
Armando Pimentel, Jr. - President & Chief Executive Officer, NextEra Energy Resources, LLC: Yeah, Julien, it's Armando again. Just to follow up on what I said before, in the near-term here there is obviously some discussion with our customers about the Clean Power Plan, and they're taking advantage because they don't know whether the Clean Power Plan is going to work out, but they see that it's a huge benefit while there is a production tax credit to sign up cheaper wind. The 2017 and 2018 discussions that we've been having on wind – a lot of folks are obviously concerned about whether there's going to a production tax credit or not, but in my view, whether there is a production tax credit or not, the combined 2017 and 2018 years I think will be pretty good for us. If there is no production tax credit, my expectation would be that the amount of wind that you see get built in 2017 would be below what we would otherwise have seen and what we have seen in the last couple of years, but I think that's only a temporary blip before 2018 starts coming back. The economics for wind and, honestly, the economics for solar from the customer standpoint are very attractive today with the PTC and with the ITC for solar. They're very attractive without the 30% ITC when you get out to the 2018, 2019 timeframe, and we believe that for wind, they will be very attractive, even without the PTC by the end of the decade. So customers are aware of that. There is obviously some uncertainty about the Clean Power Plan, but I think that uncertainty is actually playing in our favor. People want to take action early.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: Great. Two further quick clarifications. Your credit expectations here for S&P and Moody's, what are your expectations for financing in 2016 here? You obviously are well within the range on both. Just to be very clear about this?
John W. Ketchum - Senior Vice President-Finance: Yeah, Julien for financing activity in 2016, we continue to evaluate where we are from a CapEx standpoint. We still have another quarter of wind origination to go. We've had strong cash flow growth as well. We've got some other levers within the portfolio that we're looking at, a couple of balance sheet optimization opportunities. Kind of a long way of saying that we're still working on framing up exactly what that's going to look like. But....
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: Perhaps to be more specific, the projections of 26%, for instance, for SMP, that does not contemplate incremental equity, or just I know it's a moving target given the size of the CapEx budget, but...
John W. Ketchum - Senior Vice President-Finance: Yeah. We don't know yet. There are factors at play, again, having the strong quarter of origination on wind at 725 megawatts, looking to see how we come in on the fourth quarter, looking to see how we finish up from a cash flow perspective, and then looking at 2016, what the CapEx need might be and then looking at the other levers within the existing portfolio and some of the optimization things that are on our list. Obviously, the goal is to keep any equity issuance down as low as possible if we have to do something.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: And last quick one. Where do you stand on merchant divestment, specifically Texas. Just curious what your thoughts are broadly about it because you seem to have commodity sensitivity, be it from wind projects or combined cycles in Texas.
James L. Robo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, so Julien, I'll start out with the general comment that you guys will ho-hum to. But I mean it's true. I mean we look at that portfolio, our entire merchant portfolio every year and try to determine whether it still makes sense for us from a shareholder perspective to retain those merchant assets based on our view, which is not necessarily the market view, based on our view of what we think those markets are. We're going through a process in Texas on Lamar and Forney. I warn folks all the time, we've gone through processes before on our merchant assets. And that doesn't necessarily mean at the end of the day that we divest those assets. We sometimes go through the process and we retain those assets, but we believe that there may be folks that are very interested in those assets; they've been great assets for us. We believe that there might be a shareholder base or other bases out there that believe those assets are worth more to them than they would be to our shareholders. So we're going to take it, look at that very seriously here over the next couple of months. And if we decide that it make sense, then we will likely make the decision to divest. But those should not be the – I know there has been a focus on those assets; those should not be the only assets that investors and analysts believe that we're looking at. I mean, we look at all of our assets every year, and determine whether it makes sense for us to continue to hold them. Those are just, honestly, the ones that are public at this point.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Steve Fleishman. Your line is open.
Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC: Yeah. Hi, good morning. Just on the – curious kind of the latest updates on the gas reserve additions in Florida and just with the environment continuing to maybe get more attractive to buy reserves, how you're thinking about that potential?
Eric E. Silagy - President & Chief Executive Officer, Florida Power & Light Company: Yeah. Hi Steve, this is Eric Silagy. So we are – you know, with gas prices coming down, we'll see how the market plays out, but we think there's going to be opportunities. We're going to be very judicious in how we approach this and making sure that we're locking in long-term positive deals for customers. So we have a program that's underway right now at – in one play in Oklahoma and that's going well. And we've got origination teams that are talking to multiple counterparties on opportunities. So I think we'll see how everything plays out in the market from a gas perspective, but right now we see this as presenting actually some potential opportunities.
Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC: Okay. And then, separate question. Just on NEP, maybe, Jim, is there any way to give some color on your intentions with this buyback in terms of just, you know, is this something where you'd want to be in right now doing; is this something that's kind of there if there's another kind of attack on yieldco, so to speak, or just how should we think about the buyback?
James L. Robo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: So, I think I probably should limit what I said to what I said in my remarks, Steve, but I am certainly not going to lay out prices at which we're buying or the prices at which we're interested in doing the ATM. You know that's – part of the thinking behind this is to give us the flexibility to issue units when we think the price supports new issuance and the buyback gives us the opportunity to show our commitment to the partnership by buying units when we think they're undervalued, and...
Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC: Okay.
James L. Robo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I think it's as simple as that, honestly.
Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC: So it's kind of a buy low, sell high – kind of a new concept. Okay. Makes sense.
James L. Robo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: You said it, not me, Steve.
Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC: And then, lastly, just could you maybe give us any color or latest thoughts on the Hawaiian Electric deal?
James L. Robo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Sure. So we continue to work hard to get the final hurdle, which is state regulatory approval in Hawaii. We have recently gotten a couple intervenors to either fall away or announce their support, and I was very pleased that the IBEW announced their support for the transaction last week. And we continue to work it. I think my expectation, based on timing right now, is that we're not going to get any kind of decision from the PSC until next year, and so we're going to continue to work it and continue to talk to the parties to try to get it across the finish line.
Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC: Great. Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Paul Ridzon. Your line is open.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: One of the drivers you discussed on the reduction in years earnings was a drop-off of state tax incentives. How does that unfold over the next several quarters? And was that just a concentration risk of your adding some assets in a particular region?
John W. Ketchum - Senior Vice President-Finance: Yeah. A couple things there, Paul. One was just pushing part of a CITC project out into the next year. And then the second was, when you look back at our Q3 results for 2014, I think we had about 500 megawatts of projects that we had built in Oklahoma. Only had about 100 megawatts this quarter, and so, you know, Oklahoma has that state ITC, so it was really a combination of those two factors.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And then at FP&L, it looks as though we're actually seeing some modest demand destruction. As you think about your rate case, I mean, decoupling – is that on the table? Or maybe an annual look for a true-up, and how are you thinking about that strategically?
Eric E. Silagy - President & Chief Executive Officer, Florida Power & Light Company: Yeah, Paul, this is Eric Silagy. No, we're not looking at any decoupling. Again, I think you go look overall at both our performance as well as the fact that the state continues to grow, we feel very good about our prospects going forward.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Is that something you'll try to put into your regulatory strategy?
Eric E. Silagy - President & Chief Executive Officer, Florida Power & Light Company: How we look at moving forward – our base – our rates are set on a projection of test year. And so, it will take into account that we have strong customer growth coming in as well as more modest growth from the standpoint of usage or potentially negative usage. So both of those factors get factored into looking at what our revenue requirements are.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And then lastly, there was a large swing at corporate – was that just a timing issue or could you delve a little bit deeper into what drove that?
John W. Ketchum - Senior Vice President-Finance: Yeah. Some of that, as we mentioned in – or I mentioned in the script was the consolidating tax adjustment, and with PMI or the customer supply and trading business having a good year, the apportionment factors that are used by many states are revenue based, and so that can kind of skew results in the more favorable tax jurisdictions, and that's really one of the main drivers there.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: So none of these is a marked shift, and look for improvement going forward?
John W. Ketchum - Senior Vice President-Finance: That's something that's really dependent on the business mix and kind of where our revenues are coming from, what states. So it's not something you can necessarily count on quarter to quarter.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you for your help.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Jonathan Arnold. Your line is open.
Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, guys.
John W. Ketchum - Senior Vice President-Finance: Good morning, Jonathan.
Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Quick one. So, Jim, you mentioned a couple of times, I think you called it chaos in the yieldco space, and I think you stressed that you see that helping you from a competitive positioning standpoint in the development business. My question, I guess is, do you see some M&A opportunities falling out of that situation? Or is that really less your focus here; it's more about winning new projects yourself?
James L. Robo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, Jonathan, we have always felt that organic development creates more value than project acquisitions do or, frankly, even overall company acquisitions unless it's a pretty unique situation. So our focus is going to be on organic growth. We have always had project acquisitions as a part of our mix, and we will continue – I do think there will be some opportunities here. I think there's a real question about whether folks are going to realize that when they're selling projects that they're not going to get the same kind of value that they perhaps would have gotten four months ago, and there is also – we're very picky about the quality of the project, when we're looking at it from a project acquisition standpoint. So I would expect there to be more opportunities there than there would have been a few months ago, but, honestly, our focus is really on – and I think the most high-value added opportunity for our shareholders is to be focused on growing our organic capabilities.
Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: It sounds like priorities are organic, then possibly projects and last on the list sort of whole portfolio company type things?
James L. Robo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I think that's a fair prioritization, Jon.
Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. And then just one other thing on Canadian Wind; anything to report on the recent Ontario RFP? And if you – what are your – line of sight on some success there, and when would we hear about it in the backlog?
Armando Pimentel, Jr. - President & Chief Executive Officer, NextEra Energy Resources, LLC: Jonathan, it's Armando. I think the first – realistically, the first that we would hear about it would be very late this year. I – and that's the very earliest. My expectations are actually that we would hear some time first quarter of next year. We feel good about the bids that we put in. I always want to put things in context, though, right, I mean Canada or Ontario was looking for, roughly, I think it's 500 megawatts or 600 megawatts in total of renewables, right. So I mean we wouldn't think that it – nobody should think it's a 5,000-megawatt bid or something. I mean it's still reasonable; it's still chunky, but it was 500 megawatts. We have several projects that we think are very competitive in the process the way it's laid out. And so we're hopeful that we're going to get some of that 500 megawatts or 600 megawatts.
Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you, Armando.
Operator: Our next question is from Michael Lapides. Your line is open.
Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey Jim, coming back to M&A a little bit, but maybe a different angle. How are you looking at – you've grown your midstream business, meaning you've got Mountain Valley and Sabal Trail in the development process. You did the NET Midstream deal down at NEP. How has the share price reaction in the midstream market and valuations for privately held midstream assets – how has that impacted the opportunity set that may be available for either NEE or NEP to add via M&A more midstream, and how do you think about how you would structure that, whether you would want it up at the NEE level or down at the NEP level?
James L. Robo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: So, Michael I think, when I think about what we're doing in the pipeline space, it's really focused on very long-term contracted pipeline assets. And things that we think look a lot like our renewable business in terms of the quality of the counterparty, the consistency of the cash flows, and the ability for us to deploy our development expertise against those things. And so we have no interest in adding any midstream assets that would have any kind of commodity risk to the portfolio. We would be focused, again, first and foremost on organic development of long-term contracted pipeline opportunities, and that's really what the team is focused on. I think the NET deal was a very unique deal in that it was a very long-term contracted set of assets. There are very few of those, really, out in the marketplace. If there was one that will become available, we would look at it. And I think, honestly, it would depend on the capital markets and where we think the most efficient financing would be, where we would put it, whether we would put it at NEE or NEP, but just again, our focus there in the pipeline space is first and foremost on organic development.
Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thanks, Jim. Much appreciated.
Operator: Our next question is with Brian Chin. Your line is open.
Brian J. Chin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi, good morning.
John W. Ketchum - Senior Vice President-Finance: Good morning, Brian.
Brian J. Chin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: I think when you guys talked about others using the balance sheets and levering up to buy other companies and then you put that in the context of buying shares of NEP and continuing to execute on your wind resources, and your regulated opportunities, I mean you guys have made a pretty strong and consistent statement about where you think your capital deployment ought to be. I guess within that context, what I'm curious about is how close are you with regards to looking at NEP versus, say, NextEra shares as a good place to deploy capital and execute on buybacks. Can you give us a little bit of color of how you frame it and are the two relatively close in your opinion? I mean, obviously, you think NEP is the more interesting place at the moment. But can you give us a sense of how you frame that discussion and under what conditions you might consider deploying capital towards NEE buybacks as opposed to NEP?
James L. Robo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well I said this last month, I think, Brian that I – relative to NEE, I think NEP is extremely undervalued right now. So...
Brian J. Chin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Any...
James L. Robo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I think our announcements today are pretty consistent with that.
Brian J. Chin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: And I agree. But just any sense of color as to how you frame it, Jim, that would be great?
James L. Robo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: We look at a variety of metrics and kind of the classic metrics. And we think about it in terms of – fundamentally in terms of future cash flows.
Brian J. Chin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: This does conclude today's NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners 2015 third quarter earnings conference call. You may all now disconnect your lines. Thank you, and everyone have a great day.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners 2015 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Amanda Finnis.
Amanda Finnis: Thank you, Noah. Good morning everyone, and welcome to the second quarter 2015 combined earnings conference call for NextEra Energy and for NextEra Energy Partners. With me this morning are Jim Robo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; Moray Dewhurst, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; Armando Pimentel, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources; and Mark Hickson, Senior Vice President of NextEra Energy, all of whom are also officers of NextEra Energy Partners; as well as Eric Silagy, President and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light Company; and John Ketchum, Senior Vice President of NextEra Energy. Moray will provide an overview of our results and then turn the call over to Jim for closing remarks. Our executive team will then be available to answer your questions. We will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release, in the comments made during this conference call, in the Risk Factor section of the accompanying presentation, or in our various reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found on our websites, nexteraenergy.com and nexteraenergypartners.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. Today's presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of the non-GAAP measure to the closest GAAP financial measure. With that, I will turn the call over to Moray.
Moray P. Dewhurst: Thank you, Amanda. Good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy delivered solid second quarter results and continued to make excellent progress towards meeting its objectives for the year. NextEra Energy Partners completed the acquisition of four projects from energy resources during the second quarter and just recently signed an agreement to purchase a portfolio of seven natural gas pipelines located in Texas. As a result of NextEra Energy's strong financial performance during the first half of the year as well as this NEP acquisition announcement, we are increasing our financial expectations for both businesses. NextEra Energy's adjusted earnings per share increased $0.13 or 9%. Growth was particularly strong at Energy Resources driven by continued strong contributions from new wind and solar project additions. The impact of weak wind resource was roughly offset by another period of good performance from the customer supply business and increased contributions from the balance of the existing asset portfolio, including the absence of an outage of Seabrook in comparison to the second quarter of last year. Energy Resources had another excellent quarter of origination activity signing contracts for roughly 555 megawatts of new wind and solar projects since the last call, including an additional 125 megawatts solar project that is expected to be delivered late in 2016 that was not in our earlier development forecast. Energy Resources growth in adjusted EBITDA and operating cash flow continues to be strong year-to-date reflecting the addition of new contracted renewal projects due to the portfolio. Florida Power & Light remains on track to achieve its full year objectives. The relatively modest growth in second quarter earnings per share from the prior year was generally in line with our expectations and was impacted by share dilution timing considerations in a number of smaller items, regulatory capital employed, the capital on which FPL was able to earn a return continued to grow quarter-on-quarter with a gradual increase expected throughout the year as FPL continues to make excellent progress on its major capital initiatives. The Florida economy continues to expand at a healthy pace leading to an increasing customer accounts and a decline in inactive meters, while a warm spring led to higher weather-related usage increasing both revenues and our reserve amortization balance. FPL expects to earn in the upper half of the allowed ROE band through the remainder of the settlement period. We continue to invest in the business with a focus on delivering value to customers and I'm pleased to note that we received approval from the Florida Public Service Commission on our modified Cedar gas reserves guidelines which we expect will allow us gradually to build a portfolio of gas producing assets to act as a long-term hedge for our customers. We also announced our plan to move forward with the Okeechobee Clean Energy Center to meet a capacity need in 2019 and we entered into a settlement agreement with the Office of Public Counsel, the consumer advocate in Florida regarding our proposal to acquire the Cedar Bay generation facility. While the Florida Public Service Commission approval was still needed, we view this as a positive development. Overall we are very pleased with FPL's year-to-date results. Both FPL and Energy Resources continue to deliver excellent operating performance, the powerful [ph] and renewables generation fleet had one of their best periods ever with EFOR, or the equivalent forced outage rate, at less than 1% for the first half of the year. FPL continued to provide excellent reliability to our customers and was recently named one of 2015 Most Trusted Brands according to a nationwide study conducted by Market Strategies International. NextEra Energy Partners continues to execute against its growth plans while at the same time it's sponsor NextEra Energy Resources further extends its industry-leading pipeline of potential dropdown assets in addition to closing on four project acquisitions from Energy Resources during the quarter supporting growth in the second quarter distributions NEP has signed an agreement to acquire NET Midstream, a developer, owner and operator of seven natural gas pipelines located in Texas. NET Midstream's pipeline assets are all strategically located serving residential, commercial and industrial load in Houston, Texas and in the Eagle Ford Shale area, while the largest of the pipelines interconnect at the U.S.-Mexican border with one of Mexico's critical natural gas pipelines serving as a gateway to providing low cost Eagle Ford sourced gas to important load centers in Mexico. These assets carry with them future growth and expansion opportunities, have an industry-leading 16-year average contract life and are expected to provide attractive yields to NEP's investors. In addition, the pipelines will form an excellent complement to NEP's existing portfolio by providing high-quality predictable, long-term cash flows that will reduce the resource variability in the overall NEP portfolio. Finally, this transaction is expected to drive NEP's near term distribution growth higher, extend NEP's growth runway and at the same time be accretive to NextEra Energy's ongoing earnings. I will provide additional details on the acquisition later in the call along with our latest growth expectations for both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. In addition, the NEP Board declared a quarterly distribution of $23.5 cents per common unit or $0.94 per common unit on an annualized basis up $0.12 per common unit on an annualized basis from the first quarter. Overall, we're very pleased with the second quarter results and are in excellent position leading into the second half of the year. Now let's look at the results for FPL. For the second quarter 2015 FPL reported net income of $435 million or $0.97 per share up $0.01 per share year-over-year. Continued investment in the business was the principal driver of modest year-over-year growth offset primarily by the impact of share dilution. During the second quarter average regulatory capital employed, the capital on which FPL was able to earn a return, increased 5.6% from the prior year comparable quarter with gradual increases expected in each of the third and fourth quarters as FPL completes its full-year capital investment program. Results through the second quarter are generally in line with our expectations and we continue to expect the bulk of this year's earnings growth for FPL to be in the fourth quarter as the business remains on track for the year to deliver financial results consistent with our expectations. Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.5% for the 12 months ending June 2015 and this remains our target for the full year. As a reminder, under the current rate agreement we record reserve amortization entries to achieve a predetermined regulatory ROE for each trailing 12-month period. We entered 2015 with a reserve amortization balance of $278 million and finished the first quarter with a balance of $179 million to be utilized for the remainder of 2015 and 2016. Due to higher revenues driven by weather-related usage and customer growth, supported by a strong Florida economy, during the second quarter we reversed $66 million of reserve amortization leaving us with a balance of $245 million at the end of June which could be utilized in the remainder of 2015 and 2016. Looking beyond 2015 we continue to expect that the balance of the reserve amortization coupled with current CapEx and O&M expectations will allow us to support regulatory ROE in the upper half of the allowed band of 9.5% to 11.5% through the end of our current rate agreement in 2016. As always, our expectations assuming normal weather and operating conditions. Let me now take a moment to discuss updates since the last call on key capital initiatives. We are very pleased that we received approval from the Florida Public Service Commission on Cedar gas reserves guidelines that will allow FPL to invest up to $500 million per year in future natural gas projects. Although the amount we invest in each year will depend on the opportunities at that time, we view this as an important step in what we hope to be a larger program to provide long-term hedges against potential volatility in the market price of natural gas for the benefit of customers. Additionally, since the last call we've announced our plans to move forward with the 1622 megawatt Okeechobee Clean Energy Center to fulfill the need for additional generation capacity in 2019 as Florida continues to grow. With a projected cost of approximately $670 per kilowatt we expect this to be the most cost-effective combined cycle unit built to date in our fleet. We intend to file for regulatory approval in the coming months and expect a comprehensive process of review over a 14 to 16 months timeframe. Contingent upon receiving only due to approvals we expect to be in construction in 2017 with commercial operations mid-2019. In a positive step forward on our proposal to purchase the Cedar Bay generation facility we have reached a settlement agreement with the Office of Public Counsel to support the transaction. We expect a decision from the PSC on the settlement agreement later this month. All other major capital initiatives, including the Port Everglades modernization, infrastructure improvements to our transmission and distribution system, the addition of roughly 223 MW of cost-effective solar PV to our generation portfolio and the implementation of an upgrade solution to our peaker fleet remain on schedule and on budget. The economy in Florida continues to grow at a healthy pace. During the quarter the state passed another milestone by regaining older jobs lost during the great recession and in June reached 39 months of consistently outpacing the nation's rate of annualized job growth. Strong jobs growth has also been reflected in the states' increased levels of personal income and consistently low rates of seasonally adjusted unemployment which are now around levels last seen in mid-2008. Leading indicators in the real estate sector have also maintained a stable pace reflecting the continued strength of the Florida housing market. Finally, despite declining slightly from March the June reading of Florida's consumer sentiment remained close to the post-recession highs. Turning now to our customer usage metrics, the second quarter retail sales were up 7.6% with warm weather driving very strong cooling demand the primary driver of overall growth. We estimate that approximately 6.1% of the total 7.6% growth in retail sales can be attributed to weather related usage per customer. After adjusting for the effects of weather, second quarter retail sales increased 1.5% of which customer growth exceeded expectations by accounting for approximately 1.7% with weather normalized usage per customer declining by approximately 0.2%. As we discussed in the first quarter, it can be difficult to know how much to attribute to weather, particularly in periods with relatively strong weather comparisons. Looking ahead, we expect year-over-year weather normalized usage per customer to be close to flat after taking into account the impact of efficiency and conservation programs. We do not expect modest changes in usage per customer to have a material effect on our earnings. As a reminder, for this year and next any effects of weather normalized usage are expected to be offset by the utilization of our reserve amortization and after the expiration of our current settlement agreement will be taken into account in our regulatory planning. A number of low usage customers and inactive accounts continue to decline. The 12-month average of low usage customers fell to approximately 7.9% while the average number of inactive accounts for the quarter declined to levels not seen since before 2000. Let me now turn to Energy Resources which reported second quarter 2015 GAAP earnings of $273 million or $0.61 per share. Adjusted earnings for the second quarter were $251 million or $0.57 per share. Energy Resources' adjusted EPS increased by $0.09 per share year-over-year. The core business results were driven by continued strong contributions from growth in our contracted renewables business. New wind and solar projects placed into service during or after the second quarter of 2014 added $0.10 per share. Although the impact of all other effects was relatively minor, there were a number of individually significant items. Of particular note, year-over-year results from our existing generating assets were significantly affected by generally weak wind resource which accounted for negative $0.14 per share versus the comparable quarter. Wind resource was roughly 93% of the long-term average versus 109% in the second quarter last year. The fleet-wide resource was the fifth lowest second quarter on record over the last 37 years with particularly poor results from the western part of the portfolio. Unfortunately for reasons I will discuss later, this resource weakness may continue for some time. There are a number of offsetting effects as shown in the accompanying slide. Energy Resources growth in adjusted EBITDA and cash flow has been strong year-to-date. As compared to the first half of 2014 adjusted EBITDA and operating cash flow have increased 12% and 28% respectively, although the latter number was boosted by temporary changes in working capital. Nevertheless, we continue to see full-year cash flow from operations growing 20% to 25% assuming no major changes in commodity prices and assuming normal operating conditions. From an economic perspective NextEra Energy investors cash flow profile benefits from the LP unit distributions received from NEP as well as from the IDRs which we expect to begin receiving in the third quarter of this year. The Energy Resources development team had another successful quarter of origination activity. Since the first quarter call, we signed power purchase agreements of 400 MW of wind as well as 155 MW of solar of which 125 MW is for 2016 delivery and 30 MW is for post 2016 delivery. The 400 MW of wind added to backlog since the last call leaves a balance of 500 to 700 MW necessary to satisfy our previously announced 2016 forecast from the March investor conference. Given the strength of our wind development pipeline, our origination run rate this quarter and last and the historical customer push to find power purchase agreements before the expiration of production tax credits we expect to be able to find another approximately 700 MW of wind contracts before the end of the year, which would bring us to the high-end of our previously announced 2016 wind build range. We are very pleased with our solar development assets for the quarter as well. The new 125 MW solar project for late 2016 delivery was not included in our previous development forecast and we have increased our expectations for new contracted renewable opportunities by this amount. Turning now to the 80 MW solar contract that we mentioned on last quarter's call, recent origination activity includes another 30 MW of solar signed for post 2016 delivery which continues to demonstrate that there is demand for solar projects based on post 2016 economics after the anticipated expiration of the current special IDC support. The accompanying chart updates information we provided on last quarter's call reflects the 125 MW increase in our overall range of expectations for the development program that I just mentioned. In rounded terms, we now expect to bring into service a total of approximately 4,800 to 5,200 MW of renewables from 2015 through 2018. Our forecast assumes PTC's expire at the end of 2016 with a further extension representing a potential upside to these numbers. We are encouraged that the with Senate Finance Committee recently passed a tax extenders package that includes a two-year extension of the production tax credit, while that is just one step in the process we are pleased by continued signs of bipartisan support. In addition, we continue to pursue development of solar, wind, and storage projects in Canada including the submission of development projects this September into the Ontario Power Authority's new RFP process which also represents a potential upside to our current forecast. Let me now review the highlights for NEP. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA was approximately $102 million and cash available for distribution was $50 million. These results were slightly below our expectations for the quarter primarily due to weak wind and solar resource. We have made excellent progress delivering future growth opportunities for NEP. As you may recall, last year we made a decision to undertake a near term acceleration in NEP's 2015 growth rate in order to reach the high IDR splits by the end of the year. We believe this offers a very attractive value proposition for both NEP and NEE investors. Against the objective we completed the acquisition of four projects totaling approximately 664 MW during the quarter supporting growth in second quarter distributions in line with our previously stated expectations. The NEP Board declared an increased quarterly distribution of $23.5 cents per common unit or $0.94 per common unit on an annualized basis. NextEra Energy Partners has also entered into an agreement to acquire NET Midstream a privately held developer, owner and operator of a portfolio of seven long term contracted natural gas pipeline assets located in Texas. The NET Midstream opportunity represents the first third party acquisition for the Partnership and establishes NEP's presence in the long term contracted natural gas pipeline space. The combined portfolio includes 3.0 BCF per day of ship-or-pay contracts with on average investment-grade counterparty credit and a 16-year average contract life. The acquisition is expected to provide attractive yields to our investors and complements the Partnership's existing renewables portfolio by reducing the impact of resource variability on the oval NEP portfolio. In addition, the acquisition provides a platform for future growth and expansion opportunities associated with the NET Midstream pipeline assets for both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. From a NEP perspective, the portfolio has planned growth and expansion projects that are expected to provide an additional 1.0 BCF per day of long-term contracted volumes. $200 million of the purchase price is contingent on signing contracts representing roughly 60% of this expansion opportunity. From a NextEra Energy perspective, the acquisition provides economies of scale in pipeline operations and a platform for future growth as we build out the Sabal Trail, Florida Southeast Connection and Mountain Valley pipeline projects while civil trial for the Celtic connection amount Valley pipeline projects while continuing to look for further investment opportunities in the pipeline space. The seven natural gas pipelines in NET Midstream portfolios are power producers and municipalities in South Texas, processing plants and producers in the Eagle Ford Shale and residential, commercial and industrial customers in the Houston area and provide a critical source of natural gas transportation for low-cost U.S. sourced shale gas to Mexico. The two largest pipelines in the NET Midstream portfolio have an average age of approximately two years. The largest pipeline in the portfolio, the NET Mexico pipeline is 120-mile, 42-inch diameter natural gas pipeline that delivers low-cost Eagle Ford Shale gas to the Mexico border under a 20-year ship-or-pay contract with a BBB+ rated wholly-owned subsidiary of PEMEX a Mexican state owned oil and gas company. This pipeline is the largest connecting the Eagle Ford to the Mexican border and it has the lowest tariff. There is a strong alignment of interest with PEMEX as it owns 10% of the NET Mexico pipeline which in turn interconnects with the U.S.-Mexico border with a large strategic natural gas pipeline system, the initial part of which is jointly owned by PEMEX and Sempra. We believe this pipeline system called the Los Ramones pipeline system is critical to PEMEX's growth plans to ensure the adequate supply of natural gas to the three largest demand regions of Mexico that account for approximately 75% of Mexico's gas demand. Natural gas demand in Mexico has been growing substantially over the last five years, while at the same time Mexico based natural gas supply has been declining, which we believe increases Mexico's need for U.S. gas imports. As a result, we believe the NET Mexico pipeline is strategically positioned as a gateway to providing low-cost U.S. sourced shale gas to meet the increasing demand of Mexico load centers and growing natural gas markets. The second largest natural gas pipeline in NET Midstream's portfolio, Eagle Ford pipeline is an approximately 158-mile large diameter natural gas pipeline located in the Eagle Ford Shale anchored by a long-term ship-or-pay commitment from an investment-grade producer. The systems connection to the Agua Dulce Hub with access to multiple pipeline interconnects as well as Mexican markets uniquely positions the system to attract additional Eagle Ford Shale volumes. The third largest pipeline in the portfolio, Monument pipeline is an approximately 156-mile, 16-inch pipeline that transports gas from the Katy hub to the growing city gates of Houston as well as to the Houston ship channel and into Galveston County. There are also four smaller Texas pipelines in the portfolio that serve a variety of pipelines and residential loads. NextEra Energy Partners has elected not to hold the NET Midstream assets in a master limited partnership format, since the pipeline assets are expected to create and utilize their own tax attributes to shield taxable income for a period generally consistent with that of the partnerships renewable assets and as a result our expectations regarding the overall tax shield for NextEra Energy Partners remain largely unchanged. The transaction is valued at $2.1 billion. The total transaction size includes initial consideration of $1.8 billion which NEP expects will be financed in part by approximately $600 million of non-amortizing debt secured by the acquired assets. The transaction also contemplates a future expansion investment of roughly $300 million in 2016. This $300 million investment includes the $200 million contingent payment I mentioned earlier, payable only upon signing the expansion projects and is expected to be financed primarily with debt. Overall permanent financing is expected to consist of approximately $1.2 billion of equity and $900 million of debt. NEP has secured a $1.0 billion bridge loan facility that is available to draw on subject specified conditions to support funding requirements. NEP expects to close the transaction within the next 75 days. The acquisition is expected to contribute 2016 adjusted EBITDA and CAFD of roughly $145 million to $155 million and $110 million to $120 million respectively. Assuming the expansion projects are completed as planned the acquisition is expected to contribute 2018 adjusted EBITDA and CAFD of roughly $190 million to $210 million and $135 million to $155 million respectively. The transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to NextEra Energy Partners' distributions or unit and NextEra Energy's earnings per share. We believe the acquisition price is attractive as it compares favorably against precedent transactions in the pipeline space for similar assets with similar cash flow profiles and is expected to provide an attractive yield to NEP investors as well. In addition, this acquisition opportunity extends NextEra Energy Partners runway for future drop-downs by eliminating the need for an acquisition of certain assets from Energy Resources that would have otherwise been required to meet its growth expectations for the year. In addition, the strong renewals origination growth at Energy Resources continues to expand the pipeline of generating and other assets potentially available for sale to NextEra Energy Partners in the future. We continue to believe that the ability to demonstrate a strong and highly visible runway for future growth is an important distinguishing factor for investors and a core strength of the NEP value proposition. We are very pleased with this particular acquisition opportunity and our future prospects for growth. Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy for the second quarter of 2015, GAAP net income attributable to NexEra Energy was $716 million or $1.59 per share. NexEra Energy's 2015 second quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $699 million and $1.56 respectively with adjusted EPS up 9% over prior year comparable quarter. As we discussed on the first quarter call, our earnings per share account for dilution associated with the settlement of our forward agreement of 6.6 million shares that occurred in December of 2014. In June the settlement occurred for the forward contract component of the equity units that were issued in May 2012. The impact to dilution in the second quarter was approximately $0.03 per share. Adjusted earnings from the corporate and other segment increased $0.03 per share compared to the second quarter of 2014 primarily due to miscellaneous corporate items none of which was individually notable. As a reminder, results associated with NexEra Energy transmission and gas pipelines are reported through the corporate and other segment. During the quarter our transmission team continued to work on the execution of awarded projects as well as our pipeline of development projects. Additionally, our current gas pipeline initiatives continue to make solid progress. The development of both Sabal Trail and Florida Southeast Connection continue to remain on track and we are expected to be in a position to receive FERC approval in early 2016 to support commercial operation by mid-2017. The Mountain Valley pipeline project concluded the scoping process as part of the pre-filing process with a FERC application targeted for the second half of this year. We continue to expect approximately 2 Bcf per day of 20 year firm capacity commitments with an expected capital opportunity for NexEra Energy of $1.0 billion to $1.3 billion supporting commercial operations by year-end 2018. Despite the strong performance in the first half we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share for 2015 to be in the range of $5.40 to $5.70. The very strong recovery of our customer supply and trading business in the first half was largely offset by poor wind resource. Unfortunately, although we cannot draw any firm numerical conclusions, we do know that the strong El Niño cycle that we are now in tends to be correlated with below average continental wind resource and we also know that meteorological expectations for the El Niño phase to continue. Nonetheless, we expect the overall strength and diversity of the NexEra Energy portfolio to enable us to meet the expectations originally established on our third quarter 2014 call. We also expect NexEra Energy's operating cash flow adjusted for the potential impacts of certain FPO close recoveries in the Cedar Bay acquisition to grow by 10% to 11% in 2015. Looking beyond 2015, the team has made excellent progress firming up some of the investment opportunities that we have previously discussed and the strength of the recent origination activity of Energy Resources has increased our expectations for growth opportunities in the years ahead. Having completed a closer evaluation of the 2016 through 2018 timeframe, combined with the anticipated contribution from the Texas pipeline acquisition we just discussed, our outlook has improved from the expectations we have previously shared. We expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $5.85 to $6.35 f or 2016 and in the range of $6.60 to $7.10 for 2018 implying a compound annual growth rate of 2014 base of 6% to 8% through 2018. As always our expectations are subject to the usual caveats including but not limited to normal weather and operating conditions. Turning now to NEP, the acquisition of NET Midstream increases our expectations for near-term growth. We now expect the NEP portfolio to grow to support a distribution at an annualized rate of $1.23 by the end of the year, meaning the fourth quarter distribution that is payable in February 2016. Our expectations for 2015 adjusted EBITDA of $400 million to $440 million and CAFD of $100 million to $120 million are unchanged. After 2015, we continue to see 12% to 15% per year growth in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through 2020. Assuming trading level is consistent with current market conditions this implies 2016 adjusted EBITDA of $710 million to $760 million and 2016 CAFD of $250 million to $280 million. These expectations are net of expected IDR fees of $30 million to $40 million for 2016 as we expect these fees to be treated as an operating expense. With that, I will turn the call over to Jim for closing remarks.
James L. Robo: Thanks Moray and good morning everyone. It's been a terrific first half of the year. At both NEE and NEP we've executed well both financially and operationally and we've had strong execution of our growth plans all across the board. At FPL the team continued to make excellent progress against our core strategy of investing to further improve our customer value proposition. Our goal at FPL was nothing less than to be the cleanest, lowest cost and most reliable utility in the nation and we are well on our way to achieving that. At Energy Resources we've made terrific progress against our core strategy of being the world's largest generator of wind and solar energy. I feel better than I ever have about our renewables growth prospects and the quality of our renewables development pipeline. In our gas pipeline business I am very pleased with NEP's announced acquisition of seven high-quality and long-term contracted pipeline assets in Texas. When combined with Sabal Trail, Florida Southeast Connection and the Mountain Valley pipeline, the transaction is expected to expand our scale and scope in the natural gas pipeline space serving as a platform for future growth. NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners form an excellent strategic partnership. I think NEE is a terrific sponsor for NEP with an industry-leading and growing runway of potential long-term contracted assets. NEP offers NEE the ability to highlight the value of these assets and is a significant source of cash flow for NEE as well. In addition the expected growth of general partner incentive distributions from NEP to NEE will be an increasingly important source of cash and potential value to NEE shareholders. Based on all of these factors, together with the strong growth in our underlying cash flow from operations, I'm pleased to discuss an announcement by the Board of NextEra Energy to implement a new dividend policy for NEE shareholders. As you may recall, in 2012 the Board of NextEra Energy approved a dividend policy targeting a 55% payout ratio for 2014 that was based on an analysis of appropriate payout levels for regulated utilities, contracted assets and other portions of our business mix. At that time the new policy were the two years of roughly 10% growth per year dividends per share. In thinking about longer-term dividend policy the Board takes into account amongst many other factors the changing mix of NextEra Energy's portfolio of businesses and the ongoing levels of dividend payout generally supportable by each major segment of the portfolio, as well as the payout ratios of competing businesses in each of those major segments. Through the launch of NEP and other yieldcos we believe there is new market evidence regarding payout ratios supported by a strong and balanced portfolio of contracted assets. What has become clear is that a business like Energy Resources that is largely composed of contracted generation assets and cash flows can and should support a higher dividend payout ratio. Applying higher market comparable payout ratios to the contracted portfolio of Energy Resources yields a higher portfolio average payout. In addition, when looking at the payout ratios of a broader peer group of yieldcos other infrastructure companies and regulated utilities targeting a higher level would more closely align NextEra Energy with its peers. Combining these market factors with the expectation for energy resources contracted EBITDA and cash flow to continue to increase through 2018 as a result of new project additions and the receipt of proceeds from NEP for asset acquisitions, limited partnership distributions, and incentive distribution rights fees, we feel it is warranted to highlight more directly the strong underlying cash flow productivity of the Energy Resources business. Although the decision by the Board of Directors to pay a dividend must consider all the facts and circumstances at the time of declaration, the Board presently expects to increase our dividend payout ratio from its current level of 55% to a target dividend payout ratio of 65% by 2018. We expect this new dividend policy along with our expectations for growth in adjusted earnings per share to yield dividend per share growth of 12% to 14% per year through at least 2018, of a 2015 base of dividends per share of $3.08. The Board of Directors of NextEra Energy declared a quarterly dividend of $0.77 per share. Based on the timing of the increased cash flow from the year in relationships with NEP that I just described, we expect the dividend to begin to increase within the framework of the new dividend policy that I just described in 2016 in a manner designed to continue to support our target credit metrics and our strong credit position. As a result, we do not expect this change to have any material effect on our credit ratings. In summary, I am as enthusiastic as ever about our future prospects. FPL, Energy Resources and NEP continue to make excellent progress across the board against all our strategic growth initiatives. Today's announcements of increasing our expectations for both NEE and NEP as well as an increased payout ratio at NEE are reflections of that enthusiasm. With that, we'll now open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Daniel Eggers with Credit Suisse.
Daniel Eggers: Hey, good morning guys. On the NEP acquisition this morning you guys have been telegraphing that you wanted to do something out in the market, but you kind of go in the pipeline side versus renewable side, can you just talk about the returns you are seeing in those different asset classes and then also kind of what sort of IRRs you're seeing on that project since you have to keep goading us to look out for the value of these projects?
Armando Pimentel: Good morning, Dan, it's Armando. First of all, the way we looked at it is its pipelines, right, so we have different metrics, different economics that we' re looking at in that business than in the renewable business and it is not a Greenfield opportunity so the returns are you know, certainly not what you would expect from Greenfield renewable assets. But having said that, it is based on all of the market metrics that we looked at, a very positive acquisition, both in just terms of EV to EBITDA which is around 12, 12.5 times, but also in terms of CAFD, but its cash available for distribution. It's important to note that we did the acquisition because it's a good acquisition economically for NEP. This wasn’t an acquisition that we did for other reasons, i.e. IDR reasons at NEE. It is a very positive acquisition and we're very happy with it.
Moray P. Dewhurst: Just the expenses you asked about the IRRs without going into the numbers they are very consistent with other investments that we've been seeing in the pipeline space and significantly above the IRRs that we’re seeing in the third party acquisition market for renewable assets at the moment.
Daniel Eggers: So these returns are better than what we've seen in the renewables market?
Moray P. Dewhurst: In the third party acquisition market there are substantially yes, that market as I think you know become, they are down, returns have come a down significantly.
Daniel Eggers: Okay, and then I guess just on the increase in both the EPS growth rate and the dividend growth rate, how should we think about long-term equity financing and funding needs of the company as more dollars or underlying growth are going to be returned back to shareholders through the dividend?
John Ketchum: Dan, this is John. The change in the dividend policy was all about cash flows at Energy Resources. You know, we've executed very well on our long-term contracted renewables plan. We've had strong growth at NEP as well. And then looking out at the peers in terms of where the payout ratios are for other yieldcos and infrastructure plays, we thought that justified a higher payout ratio. And when you look at what the financing requirements will be long-term in that to finance the dividend we have a lot of underlying cash flow that's going to be available to support that and then we also have a lot of levers available that we can pull internally to go ahead and finance what is going to be a small cash need.
Daniel Eggers: Okay, thank you guys.
Moray P. Dewhurst: Dan, just to supplement that, remember that one of the effects of having NEP is that we really are accelerating the realization of the underlying cash flows from the projects, so effective financing needs are lower than they were in a pre-NEP world. 
James L. Robo: We’re ready for the next question.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. 
Jonathan Arnold: Hi, good morning guys.
James L. Robo: Good morning Jonathan.
Jonathan Arnold: Just a quick one, just I'm not sure we heard this correctly, but on the expansion at NET, is it $300 million of additional spend, but that breaks down, $200 million as consideration and only $100 million of CapEx, do I understand that right?
Armando Pimentel: Yes, that’s roughly right, it is about $200 million in additional consideration about $85 million in CapEx. We rounded that to about $300 million.
Jonathan Arnold: And so, but then $50 million of incremental EBITDA, can you just give us a little sense of how then it looks like a pretty decent return on that just if we ignore the consideration piece, what exactly is going on.
Armando Pimentel: Well, I think what’s going on there is, we wanted to make sure that for other incremental opportunities, that we both were not paying the same thing as we were for the opportunities that were already in the door. So that’s why you’ve got a roughly six times EBITDA, EBIT to EBITDA multiple on that and roughly about 12.5 times on the whole deal.
Jonathan Arnold: The expansions Armando are they contracted and what yet has to be done to…?
Armando Pimentel: It will, well the contracts would have to be signed. Right? They’re not signed. If they were signed then it would be just be part of the deal, but we feel pretty good about them based on the details that we know about the opportunities themselves, but we also feel like there is a good alignment of interest between the sellers and the buyers that there is an opportunity obviously to increase the purchase price by couple $100 million. So we feel good with the alignment of interest and we feel good with the underlying opportunities which will again be long-term contracted type opportunities in the 20-year range.
Jonathan Arnold: Okay and did you say what sort of timeframe you expect for clarifying that?
Armando Pimentel: Yes, our expectation is that they'd be done in 12 months. 
Jonathan Arnold: Okay and then just, if I may, just one other thing we noticed this typical slide on the financial outlook, the resources businesses is no longer in the deck is that, has that gone permanently or is it just well digesting some of these new things?
Moray P. Dewhurst: It’s the latter. The introduction of the NET Mexico acquisition is likely to change our thinking about further acquisitions for any NEP. While we have made a rough aggregate cut of that we haven’t yet rippled all that down to the level of the individual segments that are shown in the chart that you’re referring to Jonathan. So, rather than trying to doing something in haste and introduce the possibility of errors as we pulled it for this quarter, but we expect to bring it back with the third quarter.
Jonathan Arnold: Great, thank you very much.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Michael Weinstein with UBS.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning it's Julien here.
James L. Robo: Good morning.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: So, perhaps just to touch base on the credit implications in this all can you elaborate on how you’re thinking about the overall consolidated next year balance sheet from both the GPS, any acquisitions and perhaps in conjunction with that speaks to a potential desire to expand the platform more towards midstream and/or perhaps with a need to maintain a regulated mix in the portfolio?
Armando Pimentel: Let me ask Jim to comment on the second part, the strategy aspect and then John will comment on the credit metric side. Yes, looking at it from a credit metrics standpoint, we’re fine. We're within the range that we’ve committed to with the agencies. The acquisition opportunity again will be about $1.2 billion of equity, $900 million of debt. I'll let Jim speak more about the strategic elements.
James L. Robo: Good morning, Julien. So I think we’ve always said that we have liked the pipeline space, I think originally when we announced Sabal Trail and Florida Southeast Connection we said that, that was not going to be a one and done exercise for us that we felt like the pipeline space was both attractive. It was long term contract typically and it was attractive to our over business mix, both from a shareholder perspective as well as from a fixed income and credit perspective and I continue to believe that and we are going to be continuing to be looking for opportunities to expand our presence there and it is a - this acquisition we are announcing at NEP today is another piece of expanding and growing that platform.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent and then perhaps just the follow up [indiscernible] question here, current year guidance just to be clear about it, effectively you’re keeping your guidance in place because of your expectations for continued weak weather throughout the balance of this year?
Moray P. Dewhurst: This year, yes that is fundamentally right, we think that there is going to be some spill over from the El Nino effect into the second half of the year and that’s likely to offset the sort of goodness that we’ve had so far. Hopefully we’re wrong and if we got a normal weather year, but that is kind of how we’re feeling right now.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Actually just, and just trying to push on this a little bit and weather forecasting but just you would in theory last throughout the duration of this weather cycle? So it’s a multiyear effect just to be clear and you raised your guidance in despite multiyear weather headwinds from weaker weather or weaker winds specifically?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Yes, I think we’re only taking a view on the impact of the El Nino cycle on this year, let’s see how it goes. These correlations are not the strongest, but they are at least meaningful in the short-term, see how 2016 looks later on.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. All right. Well congratulations again. Thank you.
Moray P. Dewhurst: Thanks Julien.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI.
Greg Gordon: Thanks. Good morning.
James L. Robo: Good morning, Greg.
Greg Gordon: Congratulations on a great quarter despite the wind resource you were facing, is it a testament to the diversification of the business. Can you go over the timing on when this deal is going to close and when you’re expecting to finance it as per usual in this capital market over the last few weeks that deal close are responding very negatively to any financing overhang even if is an accretive deal like the one you have announced, so how do you plan on navigating that?
Armando Pimentel: So we plan to close a deal sometime before the middle of October. In terms of financing the deal, we’re going to look for opportunities in the market to raise that equity during that time period. Importantly, we have I think Moray mentioned it if I remember correctly in the prepared remarks. We already have a $1 billion credit facility that backs up the equity issuance. It’s a one year term facility at very attractive pricing. So we have obviously, we want to be able to meet the financing plans and issue the equity at some point before closing. But we’re not going to do something silly either and that’s why we have the backup credit to take down if we need it.
James L. Robo: And just to add to that, Greg this is Jim. I think it’s important to understand that even with this acquisition, remember we’re going to this acquisition replaces in part several assets that we would have dropped down this year anyway and the total equity needs in NEP was a little bit higher as a result of this acquisitions because we’re going to have a little bit higher distribution growth than we originally thought for this year aren’t actually meaningfully higher than what we’re going to have otherwise. And so I think it’s – I think from a funding standpoint, the reality is, is that we have a lot of different levels there and as Armando said we are going to be smart about it and we’re in this four, we’ve always said we’re in NEP for the long-term and we’re going to continue to do what’s right for both NEP unit holders and NEE shareholders.
Greg Gordon: Thanks. One other question that is a little bit bigger picture, obviously we are getting the big reveal today from the administration on the carbon rules, the visibility you have on your backlog through 2016 is very robust and it’s a little bit less. So have you said in your last update, we will go out in the decade, is your expectation that this should galvanize counterparties to want to enter into arrangements with you for post 16 or are we really waiting more for the tax situation to change in terms of getting patronage of the extension of the PTC?
James L. Robo: Well Greg, I think it’s a little bit of both, I think in the near term, most of the drivers behind incremental renewable contracting will be driven by getting clarity on the incentives, but there is no question that today’s announcement is positive for renewables and will be positive in the long-term for our renewable business at NextEra Energy Resources. So I would view it quite positively there from that standpoint.
Greg Gordon: All right, thanks again.
James L. Robo: Thanks Greg.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.
Michael Lapides: Hey guys. Real quick, this one maybe for Eric and team, when I go back and look at the Slide Deck on FP&L in terms of expected capital spending, the slide deck you gave it at the investor day, how has that changed? What is your expectation now both for 2016 and kind of the 2017, 2018 average level for expected CapEx and therefore rate base at the utility?
James L. Robo: Hey Michael, I would say it’s basically roughly the same, I don’t see any material changes, the reserves, guidelines were approved. We had that also in the presentation deck, so we’re moving forward with that. I think it’s, I think it would be safe to assume that we’re roughly in line with where we were. Okeechobee we’ve got, we still have to get a need for that, but the RP process is done and so we’re moving forward with that as well.
Michael Lapides: Okay. Next year is a rate case year. I know it’s probably too early to talk about the number side of it. Can you talk to us just about the process and what are some of the key – I don’t know the policy implications or things you might be looking for if any in terms of changes in Florida regulation as part of this process?
James L. Robo: Yes, I will start with the process, so as you'll recall Michael it requires a first to test letter is filed, we would expect that to occur late fourth quarter or early first quarter and then that kind of kicks off formally the process, the rate case it is an eight to nine months process. The PSC sets the schedule ultimately, but obviously we have to have it all done with the final order in place, sometime in the November timeframe so we can go ahead and set rates for beginning of January 17. As to the overall policy, we are in a strong position I think to from a standpoint of what we have delivered to customers, we will be spending a lot of time with the Commission reviewing what we’ve done in the past four years during this last rate agreement and we've maintained a lowest [indiscernible] and highest reliability and we will be focusing on that kind of performance and how do we maintain that going forward.
Michael Lapides: Got it, thanks guys. Much appreciate it.
Operator: We will take our next question from Brian Chin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Brian Chin: Hi, good morning.
James L. Robo: Good morning, Brian.
Brian Chin: Question for you on the pipeline transaction, I noticed that the debt is non-amortizing debt, can you just comment on thoughts around how we should think about that going forward, are there plans to potentially convert that to more amortizing debt down the road or is that not really on the cards?
James L. Robo: The non-amortizing debt which comes with the deal, we’re not actually we're adding a little piece of couple $200 million of non-amortizing debt to the dealers. So, we expect to potentially refinance that, but if we do refinance it, it’s a pretty decent terms on the debt. If we do refinance it, it will likely be non-amortizing debt, but we don’t expect at this point to add significantly to the non-amortizing debt from the deal.
Moray P. Dewhurst: Brian just to supplement, these non-amortizing debts fairly common in the pipeline space and I think for us one of the things that we’re really starting to think about is whether non-amortizing debt has more of a role on the renewable side than it historically has for us. Historical model has not employed non-amortizing debt but that maybe something that we won’t take advantage of later on given the longevity and the good fundamentals we are seeing for the renewables business.
Brian Chin: Can you just go into that Moray, a little bit more on the general thought process of why non-amortizing debt makes more sensible renewables and how that matches up with pipelines, just if you could expand on that a little bit more that will be helpful?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Yes sure, historically we've thought of individual wind contract, wind projects you see largely as standalone entities that need to recover their cost, their capital cost through the period of the contract. When you put them in a portfolio in a vehicle like NextEra Energy Partners and given the long-term outlook for the need for renewable capacity in the country, I think the I'm certainly taking the view now, that we’re seeing the potential for those assets to go on for longer in which case it makes sense to think about increasing the cash coming off them that's available for distribution earlier than would otherwise be the case. So that’s what pushes you down the path of thinking about the use of non-amortizing debt.
Brian Chin: That’s really helpful. Thank you very much.
James L. Robo: Hey, I think we have time for one more.
Operator: And we’ll take our final question from Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research.
Steven Fleishman: Yes, hi good morning and congrats. The couple things that I guess you didn’t mentioned, first is any kind of thoughts on the Hawaiian deal and just, there does seem to opposition in your ability to get that done?
James L. Robo: Steve this is Jim, obviously the state filed a testimony ten days ago saying that they opposed the deal in its current form and the Governor held a press release where he, press conference where he said he opposed the deal in its current form. I think the key, the keywords there in its current form, they also, the state also listed several conditions that would be, I think just positive for them to think about changing their view. And we are in the process of responding to that testimony and we think we have a very strong case to put forward to the Commission around the benefits to customers, the benefits to customers were actually pretty compelling and I think we’re going be able to make that case as we go forward.  So, this was not necessarily a surprise to me that the state filed a kind of testimony that they did and we are going to continued to move forward on laying out our arguments and we look forward to the hearings we’re going to have in December to make our case.
Steven Fleishman: Okay and my other question is just on the, there is some recent story that you might be looking to sell your Texas merchant assets. I don’t know if you could talk about that and but may be more if you can at a high level, how much are you looking at, may be monetizing some assets within the newer business, I guess assets are less contracted?
James L. Robo: So, Steve I think we’re not going to comment on any individual potential transaction that’s been rumored out there. I will say that and this is not a surprise, that we’ve been consistently pretty bearish about the merchant markets around the country. I think as we continue to see the technology trends in renewables both in solar and winds and their impacts in those markets where you see high penetration of solar and wind, we continued to be pretty bearish merchant markets around the country. So, I think, if anything our views are even more bearish and there were a year ago and we will, as we always say, we always evaluate our portfolio and we’re always looking for ways to optimize it and that hasn’t changed and won’t change in the future.
Steven Fleishman: Okay, thank you.
Moray P. Dewhurst: Thanks everybody. That I think completes our time.
Operator: And this does conclude today’s conference. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Amanda Finnis.
Amanda Finnis - Director-Investor Relations: Thank you, Orlando. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the first quarter 2015 combined earnings conference call for NextEra Energy and for NextEra Energy Partners. With me this morning are Jim Robo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; Moray Dewhurst, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; Armando Pimentel, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources; and Mark Hickson, Senior Vice President of NextEra Energy, all of whom are also officers of NextEra Energy Partners; as well as Eric Silagy, President and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light Company; and John Ketchum, Senior Vice President of NextEra Energy. Moray will provide an overview of our results and our executive team will then be available to answer your questions. We will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on our current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings new release, in the comments made during this conference call, in the Risk Factor section of the accompanying presentation, or in the latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found on our websites, nexteraenergy.com and nexteraenergypartners.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. Today's presentation also includes references to adjusted earnings and adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of the non-GAAP measure to the closest GAAP financial measure. With that, I will turn the call over to Moray.
Moray P. Dewhurst - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer: Thank you, Amanda. Good morning, everyone. Both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners enjoyed strong first quarters and are off to a good start towards meeting their respective objectives for the year. At NextEra Energy, adjusted earnings per share grew 12% with Energy Resources leading the way despite generally weak wind resource. The impact of weak wind resource was roughly offset by the recovery of the customer supply business to more normal levels of profitability, and the main driver of growth continued to be the growth of the contracted renewables portfolio. Energy Resources also had another good quarter of origination activity which I will discuss in more detail later. Florida Power & Light's contribution to earnings per share grew only slightly relative to the first quarter of last year. But this may be a bit misleading as earnings per share contribution was affected by a number of small items and timing impacts, as well as by share dilution. Growth in regulatory capital employed, on the equity portion of which we expect to earn a return of 11.5% for the full year, was 5.2% and we expect this to increase a bit over the course of the remainder of the year. We are very pleased with FPL's financial results. Both main businesses continued to deliver good operating performance with excellent reliability of the generation fleet as well as FPL's transmission and distribution system. Across the fossil and renewables generation portfolio, EFOR, or the equivalent forced outage rate, was approximately 1% for the quarter, while FPL's 2014 service reliability was more than 30% better than the state investor-owned utility average. Both main businesses also continued to make good progress on their major capital initiatives which we discussed at our Investor Conference last month. All major initiatives remain consistent with our presentation in March. At NextEra Energy Partners, operating performance was excellent and weak wind resource was largely offset by better-than-normal performance from the solar assets. Cash available for distribution for the quarter was reduced by debt service payments, but was consistent with our expectations. The NEP Board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.205 per common unit or $0.82 per common unit on an annualized basis. And today, we are also announcing the execution of agreements to acquire additional assets form energy resources to support NEP's growth, details of which I will provide later in the call. Given the strong start to the year, we continue to feel very comfortable with our financial expectations for NextEra Energy and for NextEra Energy Partners, both for 2015 and for the longer term. We are very pleased with the progress we're making. Now, let's look at the results for FPL. For the first quarter of 2015, FPL reported net income of $359 million or $0.80 per share, up $0.01 per share year-over-year. Average regulatory capital employed grew roughly 5.2% over the same quarter last year. Capital expenditures during the quarter were roughly $765 million. And, consistent with the expectations we shared at our Investor Conference last month, we expect full-year capital expenditures of $3.4 billion to $3.8 billion. Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.5% for the 12 months ending March 2015. As a reminder, under the current rate agreement, we record reserve amortization entries to achieve a pre-determined regulatory ROE. We entered 2015 with a reserve amortization balance of $278 million. And during the first quarter, we utilized $99 million in order to achieve the regulatory ROE of 11.5%, leaving us a balance of $179 million which can be utilized in the remainder of 2015 and 2016. As in prior years, we expect to use surplus depreciation in the early months of the year and then reverse that usage during the summer months when revenues are higher in order to maintain the consistent regulatory ROE. Looking ahead, we expect that the balance of the reserve amortization, coupled with current CapEx and O&M expectations, will allow us to support a regulatory ROE of approximately 11.5% in 2015 and to achieve the upper half of the allowed band of 9.5% to 11.5% through the end of our current rate agreement. As always, our expectations assume normal weather and operating conditions. Before moving on, let me now take a moment to update you on some of our key capital initiatives. We continue to make good progress on the modernization project at Port Everglades which remains on budget and on track to achieve commercial operation in mid-2016. During the quarter, we closed on the Woodford shale natural gas production project in Southeastern Oklahoma. We continue to view this transaction as an important first step in what we hope will be a larger program to provide long-term physical hedges that will help mitigate the effects of potential volatility in the market price for natural gas on customer bills. Although the evaluation of our proposed guidelines for subsequent investments has been extended beyond the expectations we shared with you last quarter, we are encouraged by actions of the Florida Supreme Court to enable the PSC to continue evaluation of the guidelines while the court reviews the PSC's approval of the Woodford project. We are now expecting further PSC activity on the guidelines in the coming months. As we announced in March, we are also pursuing a plan to acquire the 250 megawatt coal-fired Cedar Bay generation facility located in Jacksonville, Florida, which has a contract to supply capacity and energy to FPL through 2024. If approved by the commission, this transaction would lead to a change in plant dispatch that would likely significantly reduce the plant's operations and potentially enable earlier shutdown of the facility than would otherwise be the case. This plan is projected to save FPL customers an estimated $70 million and prevent nearly 1 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually. At the end of March, the PSC established a schedule for this proceeding and we are expecting a PSC decision in September. As we look toward the end of the decade, we anticipate a need for additional generation capacity as Florida continues to grow. And in March, we issued a request for proposals for 2019 capacity need. In May, FPL and an independent evaluator will each conduct separate reviews of proposals received in response to the RFP, as well as FPL's potential self-build combined cycle unit. We believe that our proposed unit would be one of the most fuel-efficient and cleanest combined cycle plants built to-date with an installed cost of approximately $670 per kilowatt. And we expect that it would be highly competitive with other alternatives. We continue to make good progress on the other opportunities we discussed at our March Investor Conference, including adding roughly 223 megawatts of cost effective solar PV to our system and implementing an upgrade solution to our aging peaker fleet. We continue to expect these projects to be completed by the end of 2016. The Florida economy continues to perform well with most indicators we track showing continued improvement. The March unemployment rate of 5.7% is the lowest level since mid-2008. The number of jobs in Florida was up approximately 284,000 compared with last year, an increase of 3.7%. And Florida is now within approximately 30,000 jobs of its pre-recession peak in employment. Florida's private sector continues to drive the state's job growth and more than 841,000 private sector jobs have been added since December 2010. The real estate sector continues to do well with new building permits remaining at a healthy level and mortgage delinquency rates continuing to decline. The Case-Shiller Index for South Florida shows home prices up 8.3% from the prior year. The overall improvement in the Florida economy appears to be reflected in consumer sentiment and Florida's consumer sentiment index level in March was the highest in 11 years. First quarter retail sales at FPL were up 1.0%. FPL's average number of customers increased by 66,000 over the prior year comparable quarter with an estimated impact on sales of 1.4%, which is consistent with our long-term expectation of 1.3% to 1.6% customer growth per year. Overall usage per customer decreased by 0.4%. While it can be difficult to know exactly how much of this to attribute to weather, particularly during a quarter where heating and cooling loads have differed significantly from long-term averages and historic correlations to mean temperature readings, we believe that weather comparisons should have provided a usage lift to about 0.8%, implying that weather normalized usage declined by about 1.2%. This is a relatively large decline, although as we have often noted, quarterly usage per customer can fluctuate somewhat randomly. While we believe that it is unlikely that we are witnessing any structural change that would suggest a continuation of weather normalized declines in usage, it is certainly possible that our expectations of roughly 0.5% increase for the full year may prove to be a bit optimistic. We will continue to analyze the usage data as they come in the months ahead and we'll update you on future calls. As a reminder, modest changes in usage per customer are not likely to have a material effect on earnings this year as we will adjust the level of surplus depreciation utilization to offset any effect and allow us to maintain the expected 11.5% regulatory ROE. Any changes we may make to our outlook for future years will, of course, be reflected in our expectations going forward. Let me turn now to Energy Resources, which reported first quarter 2015 GAAP earnings of $278 million or $0.62 per share. Adjusted earnings for the first quarter were $260 million or $0.58 per share. Energy Resources' adjusted EPS increased by $0.10 per share year-over-year. As discussed earlier in the call, customer supply and trading returned to more normal levels of profitability, adding $0.20 per share relative to last year's first quarter. You may recall that last year's first quarter results were impacted by polar vortex conditions in the Northeast that caused parts of our customer supply business to underperform, and we did not experience the same adverse effects in the first quarter this year. Existing assets mostly offset this positive with negative $0.17 per share primarily caused by below average wind resource of approximately 87% during the quarter versus 107% in the comparable period last year. Fleet-wide wind resource for the quarter was the second lowest first quarter on record over the past 37 years and the absolute lowest first quarter in Texas. Fortunately, the wind resources began to return to more normal levels in April. Contributions from new investment added $0.09 per share due to continued growth of our contracted renewables business. Gas infrastructure added $0.02 per share. Given current market conditions, we elected not to invest capital in drilling certain wells, which resulted in earlier recognition of income through the value of the hedges we had in place. This benefit more than offset increased depreciation expense as a result of higher depletion rates. Increased corporate G&A and other costs contributed negative $0.04 of the year-over-year change. All other effects were minor, as reflected on the accompanying slide. Energy Resources growth and adjusted EBITDA and cash flow were both strong. For the first quarter of 2015, adjusted EBITDA and operating cash flow increased 20% and 42%, respectively, from the prior year comparable quarter. While we expect considerable variability in cash flow growth from quarter to quarter, we see full-year cash flow from operations growing 20% to 25%, assuming no major changes in commodity prices and assuming normal operating conditions. The Energy Resources development team had another good quarter of origination activity. Since our last earnings call, we have added 200 megawatts of wind projects and roughly 300 megawatts of new solar projects to our renewables backlog and we are well-positioned to add further projects in the weeks ahead. We are particularly pleased that roughly 80 megawatts of solar capacity is for post 2016 delivery, suggesting that we can expect to see continued demand for solar projects even after the anticipated expiration of the current special ITC support. The accompanying chart updates information we provided at the March Investor Conference, but our overall expectations have not changed. We continue to expect to bring into service a total of approximately 4,700 megawatts to 5,100 megawatts of renewables from 2015 through 2018. Our forecast assumes PTCs expire at the end of 2016, with a further extension representing a potential upside to these numbers. In addition to our development efforts in the United States, our future development efforts in Canada were focused on leveraging our Ontario feed-in tariff experience and we intend to participate in the new RFP processes that are expected to occur later this year and in 2016, which may present additional opportunities for wind, solar and storage projects. Let me now review the highlights for NEP. First quarter adjusted EBITDA was approximately $70 million and cash available for distribution was negative $15 million. As I mentioned earlier, cash available for distribution was affected by debt service payments, which for some projects occur semi-annually, and the CAFD for the quarter was consistent with our expectations. Before accounting for debt service, cash available for distribution was positive $52 million. While weak wind resource adversely affected most of the portfolio's wind projects, performance of the solar assets was better than expected and the net effect was not material. During the quarter, in addition to the closing of the 250-megawatt Palo Duro contracted wind project in Texas that we announced in January, NEP closed on its agreement to acquire Shafter, a 20-megawatt contracted solar project in California, for approximately $64 million, through the use of its existing revolving credit facility. The project is expected to close on its financing and enter service by the end of the second quarter. We continue to execute on our plan to expand NEP's portfolio and I'm pleased to announce that the conflicts committee of the NEP board has reached an agreement with a sponsor to acquire four additional assets from the Energy Resources portfolio. This acquisition portfolio is a geographically diverse mix of assets, collectively consisting of approximately 664 megawatts with a megawatt-weighted remaining contract life of 18 years. The transaction represents another step towards growing LP unit distributions in a manner consistent with our previously stated expectations of reaching an annualized rate of at least $1.13 per unit by the end of the year. NEP expects to acquire the portfolio for total consideration of approximately $412 million, plus the assumption of approximately $269 million in debt and tax equity financing. The purchase price is subject to working capital and other adjustments and assumes additional project debt of approximately $60 million, which we expect to close within a few months of the acquisition. The acquisitions are expected to contribute 2015 adjusted EBITDA and CAFD of roughly $40 million to $50 million and $15 million to $20 million respectively and to increase the annual run rate of adjusted EBITDA and CAFD by roughly $75 million to $85 million and $28 million to $32 million respectively. We are currently evaluating a number of funding alternatives to finance the transaction, which we expect to close by the middle of May. Once completed, we expect to be able to grow our second quarter LP unit distributions to an annualized rate of approximately $0.94 per unit while maintaining our 2015 guidance of $400 million to $440 million and $100 million to $120 million of adjusted EBITDA and CAFD, respectively. Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy, for the first quarter of 2015, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $650 million or $1.45 per share. NextEra Energy's 2015 first quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS was $631 million and $1.41, respectively, with adjusted EPS up 12% over the prior year comparable quarter. Year-over-year growth in first quarter operating cash flow was also very strong at 16%. Consistent with the expectations we have previously shared for a slight improvement in our credit metrics in 2015, our results for this quarter account for the effects of dilution associated with the settlement of our forward agreement for 6.6 million shares that occurred at the end of 2014. The impact of dilution in the first quarter was an approximately $0.03 per share decline from prior year comparable quarter. As a reminder, our full year results will also be impacted by the settlements of the forward contract component of our equity units issued in May 2012 and September 2012, and the dilutive effects of these settlements will also have an impact on prior-period comparisons for the remaining quarters of this year. Adjusted earnings from the Corporate and Other segment increased $0.04 per share compared to the first quarter of 2014, primarily due to miscellaneous corporate items, none of which were individually notable. As a reminder, results associated with NextEra Energy Transmission and gas pipelines are reported through the Corporate and Other segment and our current infrastructure development initiatives continue to progress well during the first quarter. Florida Southeast Connection and the Sabal Trail Transmission are on track, and we expect to be in the position to receive FERC approval around the end of this year. The land easement process continues to progress appropriately to support project construction assumptions, and we continue to expect a mid-2017 commercial operations date. For the Mountain Valley Pipeline joint venture with EQT Corporation, we were pleased to announce during the quarter the addition of WGL Midstream as an additional shipper on the line, as well as the addition of WGL Midstream and Vega Midstream as additional partners. The project has secured approximately 2 Bcf per day of 20-year firm capacity commitments with an expected capital opportunity for NextEra of $1 billion to $1.3 billion. Development efforts continue to progress well with the FERC application targeted for the fourth quarter of 2015 and entering commercial operations by year-end 2018. During the quarter, our transmission team was selected by the Cal ISO to develop, build, own and operate two competitive transmission projects. These projects are the first non-incumbent utility awards for competitive transmission projects in California. While a relatively modest and expected investment size, we are very pleased with these recent successes. While our first quarter performance was strong, a number of the key drivers, such as the recovery in our customer supply and trading activities at Energy Resources, were well-established heading into the year. Based on what we see at this time, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share for 2015 to be in the range of the $5.40 to $5.70 per share. The expectations we provided in March for 2016 through 2018 are also unchanged. We continue to see adjusted EPS growth at a compound annual growth rate of 5% to 7% through 2018 off our 2014 base. As always, our expectations are subject to the usual caveats including but not limited to normal weather and operating conditions. Turning now to NEP, our expectation's taking into account all the asset acquisitions we are now contemplating are unchanged since the last call and the details we discussed at our Investor Conference last month. For the full-year 2015, we continue to expect the NEP portfolio to grow to generate adjusted EBITDA of $400 million to $440 million and CAFD of $100 million to $120 million. This would support a distribution level at an annualized rate of at least $1.13, which corresponds to the upper tier of the IDR splits by the end of the year or possibly slightly earlier. After 2015, we continue to see 12% to 15% per year growth in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations for at least the next five years. Assuming trading levels roughly consistent with current market conditions, this implies 2016 adjusted EBITDA of $580 million to $620 million and 2016 CAFD of $170 million to $190 million. These expectations are net of expected IDR fees of $20 million to $30 million for 2016, as we expect these fees to be treated as an operating expense. To sum up, we continue to believe that NEE and NEP offer some of the best value propositions in the industry. We remain very focused on the major initiatives we discussed at our Investor Conference last night – or last month, and we are off to a very strong start. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we will now open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our first question from Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.
Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hey. Good morning, guys.
Moray P. Dewhurst - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer: Good morning.
Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): I guess just following up kind of on the NEP dropdowns, at the Analyst Day, you guys brought up more discussion on acquisitions or the willingness to look at those kinds of projects coming available. Can you just discuss what you're seeing in the market as far as actual qualifying projects that could be bought? And then just walk us through how you guys think about the cost of capital and how you budget equity cost of capital relative just the low yield where NEP trades today?
Armando Pimentel - President & Chief Executive Officer, NextEra Energy Resources LLC: Okay. Well, that was a few questions; Dan, it's Armando. We continue to see – I mean, the reason we brought it up at the Investor Conference is we continue to see sellers of individual assets and small portfolios out in the market. Some have transacted. Some have come to market, taken their assets back, maybe waiting for a better time. We continue to participate, as you might expect, in anything of significance that comes to the market. But we're doing it, honestly, from a position of strength. I mean we have a very, very nice portfolio, that I think everybody would agree, sitting at Energy Resources and our expectations would be that we will continue to drop those assets down into NEP from Energy Resources. But we will pursue acquisitions in the market if they make some sense. If none happen this year, that's fine. I don't think anybody is going to be really disappointed. We're not going to try to be more aggressive than the next guy. We're going to try to be diligent in what we do. Having said that, I do believe that there will be, hopefully, some assets that work for our metrics and our portfolio. The metrics, by the way, that we use when we are taking a look at acquisitions, because you asked a cost of capital question, are not much different than the metrics that we would use at Energy Resources, right. I mean, obviously, we realize that we have a great currency at NEP and it's trading at a very nice yield. But in addition to CAFD and EBITDA multiples, which everybody seems to be focusing on, we continue to look at unlevered returns and ROEs even though the NEP units obviously trade very well compared to our other currency.
Moray P. Dewhurst - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer: Dan, just a couple of comments on the cost of equity question. I think partly because the space is relatively new and partly because market conditions are, shall we say, historically unusual, nobody can tell you exactly what the cost of equity for any of these vehicles is. It very clearly isn't simply the trading yield because that reflects expectations of growth which differ significantly from entity to entity; but it is also clearly true, at least in my judgment, that what we are seeing is with the creation of a vehicle like NEP, that we are accessing a lower cost of capital than we previously were able to take advantage of with respect to the long term ownership of the cash flow streams from these contracted renewable projects; though that's different from saying that there's been a change in the cost of capital for the development business.
Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): That's good. Thank you for clarifying that. And, I guess, just on the pipeline of renewable additions, you guys were able to get down some solar beyond the 2016 time line. Are you guys still seeing opportunity and interest in more projects getting done kind of beyond the two-year visible window and when do you think you might convert more of those into a bigger pipeline?
Armando Pimentel - President & Chief Executive Officer, NextEra Energy Resources LLC: We're seeing, actually, a couple of things, Dan. The first thing that we're seeing is we're seeing some folks coming into the market, in our view a little late, looking for 2016 projects. But having said that, we don't expect to sign any additional 2016 projects, as you can see from our disclosure. That doesn't mean that we may surprise ourselves and get something else in the pipeline. But the focus really now is on execution of everything that we have in the backlog: for 2015 wind, for 2016 wind and 2016 solar, in addition to taking a look at solar beyond 2016. And what we are seeing, with this first PPA that was signed beyond 2016, we are seeing more interests particularly in the 2018 and 2019 timeframe from some of our traditional customers. So I don't know whether that's going to mean that next quarter or the following quarter we've got a bunch of PPA announcements for 2018 or 2019. But what I like to see is that people are asking and inquiring as to what we could do in that timeframe. So I'm hopeful that we will be able to sign some way before the end of 2016.
Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. Thank you, guys.
Moray P. Dewhurst - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer: Thanks.
Operator: And next, we'll take a question from Brian Chin with Merrill Lynch.
Brian J. Chin - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Hi. Good morning.
Armando Pimentel - President & Chief Executive Officer, NextEra Energy Resources LLC: Good morning, Brian.
Brian J. Chin - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: You highlighted on slide 8 that the underlying usage growth of minus 1.2% was a point of note, and that you might use the surplus D&A balance to offset this if the trend continued. If you continue to track at this minus 1.2% for the rest of the year, would you expect that the surplus D&A levels, just given how you tend to use it at the beginning of the year and then you tend to add to it at the end of the year, do you think that that surplus D&A amount would be sufficient to offset a minus 1.2% trajectory? Would it be insufficient or still give you a nice degree of cushion? Can you just elaborate on that a little bit more?
Moray P. Dewhurst - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer: Sure. First of all, let me state clearly that we don't expect the negative 1.2% to continue and I'll come back to that a moment. Having said that, if it were, hypothetically, to continue, by itself that 1%, roughly, of total revenue, is well within the bounds of the available surplus deprecation, so that really wouldn't be an issue in terms of this year. As a practical matter, it wouldn't be an issue for a second reason, which is that the weather in April has turned out to be very favorable. So those things are going to bounce around a little bit. But I do want to comment a little bit more on the fundamentals of the negative 1.2%. That's a large number for an individual quarter, coming off a quarter where we had positive underlying usage rate. That kind of change doesn't happen from quarter to quarter. It doesn't represent actual behavioral change, most likely. So it's probably that there's a lot of statistical noise in our weather adjustment going on here. We had a quarter that was pretty mild so there wasn't a lot of either heating load or cooling load. And in that sort of situation, a traditional model doesn't behave particularly well. And so the amount that we're extracting for weather may or may not represent what the weather impact truly was. So I'm not particularly concerned about it at this stage other than that it is possible that we are going to see a little bit lower underlying usage growth going forward. You may recall that the 0.5% expected growth in underlying usage was really still based on cyclical economic recovery from the downturn. And our long-term expectation after this year or next year is really for underlying usage to be about flat.
Brian J. Chin - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: That's very helpful. Thank you.
Moray P. Dewhurst - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Brian.
Operator: And next we'll hear from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.
Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning.
Armando Pimentel - President & Chief Executive Officer, NextEra Energy Resources LLC: Good morning, Stephen.
Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Wondered if you could provide a little bit more color on how you may finance the acquisition at NEP in terms of the $412 million. I know, Moray, you talked a little bit about that but just trying to better understand the sort of net free cash flow yield that we could expect and how you're think about financing that?
Moray P. Dewhurst - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer: Sure. There's not a lot, really, to add to what we've said before. So, I divide the financing, really, into the strategic versus the tactical. Strategically, there is going to be equity financing to maintain a reasonable overall leverage ratio for NEP, consistent with what we've spoken about before. We've said that it's reasonable to expect that projects will be acquired by NEP with somewhere between 65%, 70% leverage on them or to be levered to that level. And so, over time, you can expect to see the balance be provided by equity. So that's the long term, or the strategic, answer. Then there's the tactical, which is how do you get there from any particular point in time, and that's really what we're more examining at the moment. So there are a number of options there which, in one way or another, are tantamount to some form of bridge financing to get you to the longer term equity position, but we haven't made any decisions yet on exactly what we're going to do there.
Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Understood. And then I wanted to flip over to storage. Moray, you had mentioned wind, solar and storage. I was just curious, generally, on your take in terms of the kinds of opportunities that you may see in energy storage, what that business model might look like? I know in the past you've talked about storage linked with wind. But just very interested in where you see storage opportunities coming from?
Armando Pimentel - President & Chief Executive Officer, NextEra Energy Resources LLC: Stephen, it's Armando. It's only been a couple of months since the Investor Conference, so I can't say we're seeing a lot more or a lot less. But we're seeing a steady request from many of our traditional customers and some, what I would call, non-traditional customers, commercial customers, asking about storage and asking about storage as behind the meter, asking about storage as part of a new wind plant, our new wind plant expansion, or part of utility scale solar. So on a regular basis now, I think I indicated this at the Investor Conference, we're responding to both RFPs and non-RFPs with a storage option. But as I also said: storage is very expensive. It continues to be very expensive. And so, outside of markets where there is a regulatory call to pursue storage, so you can think about California, you can think about Hawaii, you can think of parts of New York, I don't think you're going to see a large uptick in storage CapEx for us or anybody else. I've said internally that my expectation is if we can spend $100 million of capital in storage on an annual basis over the next couple of years, I think that'll be a good thing; but that by 2020 it should be, hopefully, a more significant part of what we spend on an annual basis. So we've got a lot of folks on it looking at that technology. We've got a lot of folks in the development, but I don't expect it to be a huge jump here in the next couple of years.
Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's great color. Thank you very much.
Armando Pimentel - President & Chief Executive Officer, NextEra Energy Resources LLC: Hey, Stephen, just one last thing on your previous question; I just want to make sure because – we gave everybody a lot of numbers on these NEP acquisitions, I want to make sure that something is not being lost. Moray said it today in the prepared remarks that there's roughly $60 million or so of financing that we would expect to get project financing on one of the assets. So although the CAFD metric, cash flow available for distribution is not something that we're fixated on; there are a lot of people that are fixated on that CAFD yield. And so, when you're doing – when folks are doing that calculation, you've got to make sure that it's the $412 million of equity value that we gave you minus the $60 million of expected financing, which is going to occur here in the next couple of years, divided by the mid-range of the CAFD we gave you, which is roughly $30 million. So that gets – if anybody's interested, that would get us to 8.7. Again, it's just one of very – a bunch of metrics that we look at.
Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. That's helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Moving on. We'll hear from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: Hi. Good morning.
Moray P. Dewhurst - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer: Good morning, Julien.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: So, I wanted to address M&A but in a more generic context when you think about regulated opportunities. Could you perhaps articulate the value proposition of pursuing more regulated assets within your overall corporate mix? Perhaps could you talk to some of the value either á la an NEP route or just what criteria might be vis-à-vis minimum accretion levels in pursing further opportunities on that side? I want to avoid the specific question but kind of get more tactical in understanding what the value proposition would be if you were to pursue any subsequent deals sort of ahead of time if you will?
James L. Robo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: So, Julien, this is Jim. I think we – I think talked a little bit about this last month at the Investor Conference. I think overall there are obviously a set of constraints in the industry to doing regulated M&A; those include the fact that you need to get state regulatory approvals, the fact that oftentimes synergies are shared with customers such that you can't afford to pay a very big premium. Management teams tend not to be particularly excited about doing deals in this industry particularly given that you can't pay, necessarily, a very big premium. So there are set of constraints that you have to operate and as you think about regulated M&A. That said, we've – for a very long time, have had a view that this is a – that scale matters in this industry ,that this is a very – for an industry that is as technology driven and is scale driven as it is – as this is, that it's very unconsolidated. That secondly, there is enormous differentials in performance across the industry; you just need to pull the FERC data and look at the FERC data on a cost-per-customer, cost-per-megawatt-hour basis for utilities across the country to see those kind of enormous operating cost differentials. There's also, frankly, enormous service reliability differentials. We see enormous differentials in terms of generation performance across utilities. And so, we've always had a view that we would have a lot to bring to a target in terms being able to run it better. And so the other constraints, as we think about regulated M&A, is that we have a very constructive set of regulatory jurisdictions right now. And as we think about regulatory – regulated M&A, it's important that the jurisdictions that you would consider would also be viewed as constructive. So that also was another constraint to being able to do it. But I think the main view of how you would create value over a long period of time is the combination of us being able to bring to bear our ability to run a utility much better than it's being run currently combined with, I think, a view that we have that we can deploy capital and technology in a way that can transform utilities for the betterment of both the customer and for the shareholder, much of how – much of which we have done over the last 15 years here in Florida. So, hopefully, that's helpful to give you a framework of how we kind of think about regulated M&A.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: But it's not necessarily á la NEP? There's no energy with that strategy?
James L. Robo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Julien, I think, in almost every state jurisdiction you would look at, I think it's very hard to think about putting a utility asset into a yieldco without a significant amount of regulatory risk.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: Yes. Okay. And then, subsequently, just to come back to a comment you made earlier on the call, with respect to Canada and opportunities there, Ontario, can you elaborate a little bit around storage, wind and solar? You don't seem to have a lot in your backlog, as far as I can tell, in kind of the longer data period.
Armando Pimentel - President & Chief Executive Officer, NextEra Energy Resources LLC: Sure. Sure, Julien; it's Armando. Several years ago, as many of you know, we were successful in winning a significant number of RFPs in the wind space. But even before that, we were successful in buying some solar assets and some wind assets in Canada. The nice thing – actually, the very nice thing about the success that we had a number of years ago is we built a great team in Canada. We have an office in Canada. We have continued to develop assets and properties both on the wind and solar side in anticipation for the next round of bids that were coming out. Those bids in Ontario have been delayed a couple of times. We're pretty sure that they're going to come out again this year. And we feel comfortable that we have a number of properties that should be competitive in the process. That's not saying that we're going to pick any up but we certainly haven't been sitting on our hands up there just building the assets and so we're hopeful to be competitive in this next round this year.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: So there's implicitly upside to your Canadian forecast with the backlog there?
Moray P. Dewhurst - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer: Absolutely.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you guys for the time.
Moray P. Dewhurst - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Julien.
Operator: And next we'll hear from Paul Ridzon with Keybanc.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Good morning. Congratulations on a solid quarter.
Moray P. Dewhurst - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer: Thanks Paul.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: I had three quick questions. What are you hearing in Washington as far as ITC, PTC extension, the latest kind of body language there? And then what's your outlook for the full year at corporate given the strength in the first quarter? And then lastly, how is your outreach program going in Hawaii as far as getting the vote out given the unique kind of approval process there?
James L. Robo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: So Paul, I'll – this is Jim. I'll answer those questions. First of all the PTC, ITC, on the ITC we fully expect at the end of 2016 that the solar ITC will step down from 30% to 10%. We support that step down and I think solar is going to be cost competitive without an ITC in the back half of this decade. And so I don't think you need it to continue to drive solar demand going forward. On the PTC front, we see work on extenders probably happening, starting sometime in the late summer, early fall, once they – folks have still not given up hope on tax reform just yet this year. That hope, I think, will probably be given up in the late summer, early fall and they'll get to work on trying to get to an extenders package. I think there's clear understanding on the part of the leadership in both the Senate and the House that extending the – doing a tax extenders bill on getting it signed on December 22 or December 23 like happened last year is not optimal for planning for companies and doesn't really accomplish much of anything. And so, I would expect them to try to get working on it earlier. I think my expectation, the most likely outcome for the PTC, is a – and for the whole extenders package is a one year, just a simple one year extension, kick the can down the road. I do think there is a chance that you would see a multi-year phase out of the PTC, one that we've supported over – in the last extenders discussion. We almost got there with the multi-year phase out and extension of the PTC. And I think there's a chance that that would happen this year again. But I think, as I said, the highest odds is just a simple one-year extension of all extenders in bonus depreciation by the end of the year. On – given we've had a good first quarter, it's still very early, and we still feel very comfortable with our expectations for the full year as Moray said on the call. And then in terms of Hawaii and the shareholder votes, the vote is really not until May 12. It's very early. Things have gone well so far, but it's very early and there's a significant amount of work going on in terms of outreach to both retail and institutional shareholders and so we'll have more visibility into that as we get closer to the May 12 date.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And then, if I could just add one more. Sorry. When do you expect the Florida Supreme Court to rule on gas storage or gas reserves?
Eric E. Silagy - President & Chief Executive Officer, Florida Power & Light Co.: Hey, Paul. This is Eric Silagy. It's always hard to predict when the court is going to rule. There's no set time line for the courts to have to rule, so we'll just have to wait and see. Unfortunately, there's no visibility in that.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you again.
Moray P. Dewhurst - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Paul.
Operator: Next, we'll hear from Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research.
Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC: Yeah. Hi, everyone. Just further on the Hawaiian deal, what's the latest in terms of timelines for approval?
James L. Robo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Steve, we're still hopeful that we're going to be able to get all regulatory approvals by the end of the year and that's the target that we're working towards.
Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC: Okay. Is there any movement toward like settlement discussions or still more formal process?
James L. Robo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I think, Steve, that we're very early in the process right now and discovery will be ongoing through the summer. And we expect all of the filings to be done by the end of August and so, anything on the settlement front would be very premature.
Moray P. Dewhurst - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer: Steve, just data; we filed formal testimony. I think we've had some 300 interrogatories or data requests so far. We can expect to have a lot more over the coming months. That's good. We want to make sure that all legitimate questions are appropriately aired and that people get the answers to the questions they have because we firmly believe this is fundamentally a good deal for folks in Hawaii, customers, as well as for shareholders. So we want to make sure that all the facts come out, but it will take a while and the schedule calls for that to go through the summer.
Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC: Okay. And then one, just, follow-up question to some of the questions that came up on storage. I'm curious if you've had any pre-insight to what Tesla is going to come out with tomorrow and if it's anything that's significant within your view of movement on battery storage.
Armando Pimentel - President & Chief Executive Officer, NextEra Energy Resources LLC: Nope. Unfortunately, I didn't get my pre-earnings Twitter feed. I have no idea, Steve.
Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And moving on, we'll go Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.
Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, guys. Question for you on electric transmission, really merchant electric transmission. Can you talk about the size and the scale of the California projects and then when you look around the landscape in North America, not just U.S. but Canada, how big of a potential opportunity and how long-dated?
Moray P. Dewhurst - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer: Just on the California projects, this is not huge. What's interesting about this really is, as we said in the prepared remarks, it's a landmark. It's the first competitive award to a non-incumbent. So total capital for the two projects is going to be south of $100 million, so not material by themselves. In terms of the longer-term opportunity, I mean, the longer-term opportunity is multiple billions, but as Armando, I think, indicated earlier, it takes a long time to get there. Certainly what I've observed since we have been actively working independent transmission development is that the development cycle is even long – we thought it was going to be long, but it's even longer than we thought. So there are many more instances of competitive solicitations that keep getting deferred for one reason or another, so that's really behind the statement that we made at the Investor Conference and would repeat here today: that if we can get, by the end of the decade, to a business that's got an annual net income contribution of $50 million to $100 million, that would be doing pretty well. And, obviously, you can figure out the CapEx that's required to get to that kind of level given typical transmission returns.
Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And how do you guys think about what is as close to a normal run rate for the customer supply business, for the retail business for your trading? Meaning, is 2015 a normal year? Is it still below normal and still some of the offshoots from what happened last year? Just if you could parse those three lines of business within the year (51:54) and where you think they are versus what's your view of what a potential normal could look like?
Moray P. Dewhurst - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer: Well, first of all, in terms of normal overall, I would say, you can look to the two charts in the back for the 2015-2016 expectations as to – I think those are normal expectations given what we see today. On the specific, I think the way to think about the customer supply business is that last year's first quarter was truly abnormal in the negative sense, because of the peculiarities of the way the market behaved in response to extreme weather conditions. This year, the weather conditions actually were not that dissimilar, but the market behaved very differently. And the customer supply business behaved much more as you would expect. If anything, it was actually, probably, a little ahead of where we would have steady-state profitability levels. But having said that, the profitability of that business does vary from period to period and year to year as people move in and out of the market. It gets more or less competitive at different times. So overall, I think the forward-looking numbers that we have in those two charts with 2015 and 2016 for EBITDA and cash flow are reasonable representations of what we can expect for a typical year for those businesses.
Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thanks, Moray, much appreciated.
Moray P. Dewhurst - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Michael. I think we have time for one more question.
Operator: And next we'll hear from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Good morning.
Moray P. Dewhurst - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer: Morning, Paul.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: The customer supply business, it looks to me like – and I apologize if you guys went over this at the conference – but it looks to me, just from quarter-over-quarter, that your expectations for that business are increasing. And of course, the quarter came out pretty well. Could you just elaborate a little bit more in terms of – you guys said it was getting back to more normal levels or something. Could you talk a little bit more about that?
Moray P. Dewhurst - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. Well, as I just said in response to Michael's question, last year's first quarter was very strongly adversely affected in the Full Requirements business by the impact of extreme weather conditions, winter weather conditions, up in the Northeast. That was not the case this year. The market behaved much more normally in response to similar weather conditions, and so the business behaved much more normally. If anything, it was, again, as I said, a little bit ahead of our expectations.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: But I guess what I'm – I'm sorry, I wasn't clear. The projections in your slides for 2015 and 2016, it looks to me like the customer supply, as opposed to last quarter, looks like the projections for 2015 and 2016 have increased annually, significantly, if I'm reading them correctly, compared to the fourth quarter of 2014, when you guys had those slides there. Do you follow me?
Moray P. Dewhurst - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer: There's a little bit of an increase in there. Yeah. Basically, based on some of the good news that we see in this year we're essentially assuming that it will continue into next year.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Okay. And that's simply because of the – okay. And did you think that last quarter because you guys were apprehensive about the – was there anything that actually changed...
Moray P. Dewhurst - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer: All right. I see where you're going. Yeah. The impact of the way the markets behaved in this quarter is what gives us a little more comfort that the levels of profitability that we're seeing now may be what we should expect for the next couple of years.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Okay. Thanks. I'm sorry if I didn't ask the question clearly enough.
Moray P. Dewhurst - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer: Okay. I didn't understand it.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: And then the legislation that – the PSC reform legislation, any – it looks like it's been – the House abruptly has adjourned, I guess. And it looks like – if I understand it correctly, maybe I don't, that the Senate is sort of left with either the original House bill because I guess they amended it and were going to send it back to the House; (a), any thoughts about the legislation? Does it have any significant – do you see any significant impact that the legislation might have on you, guys, positive or negative? And (b), does it look it like it's going to happen, I guess, given what happened I guess yesterday or something?
Eric E. Silagy - President & Chief Executive Officer, Florida Power & Light Co.: Right. So, this is Eric. What I'll tell you is you're correct that the House sent back just before they adjourned the original House language. So they stripped out the three amendments that the Senate had put on the House language when they sent it over to the House. And so, they sent it back to the Senate and then they adjourned, which means that the Senate has a choice of either passing it as presented to them or not passing it. They could not take it up, that kills it; or they could vote it down, that kills it; or they could pass it as it stands. I don't see any significant impact really at all. No kind of impact to us whatsoever; not worried about that. What the Senate will do, hard to predict. It's always a challenge to figure out what's going to happen so we'll see if they even take it up.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Okay. And if they did take it up, I mean, just if it was passed as, I guess, it came out of the House, do you guys see this is as significant? It just seems like some reforms of sort of some of the elements to it. It didn't seem like anything all that substantial. I just wanted to check – but I mean, maybe I'm wrong; is there any thoughts about it?
Eric E. Silagy - President & Chief Executive Officer, Florida Power & Light Co.: No. No. You're correct. There's nothing there. I mean, frankly, it codifies what in many respects are already the rules.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.
Moray P. Dewhurst - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer: All right. Thank you, Paul. Thank you, everybody. That completes our call. Thank you for your interest.
Operator: And, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Earnings Conference Call for NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. Today’s conference is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Amanda Finnis. Please go ahead ma’am.
Amanda Finnis: [Audio Gap] NextEra Energy Partners. With me this morning are Jim Robo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; Moray Dewhurst, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; Armando Pimentel, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources, all of whom are also officers of NextEra Energy Partners, as well as Eric Silagy, President and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light Company. Moray will provide an overview of our results and our executive team will then be available to answer your questions. We will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward- looking statements, if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today’s earnings news release, in the comments made during this conference call, in the risk factors section of the accompanying presentation, or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found on our Web site nexteraenergy.com and.nexteraenergypartners.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. Today’s presentation also includes references to adjusted earnings and adjusted EBITDA which are non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today’s presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of the non-GAAP measure to the closest GAAP financial measure. With that, I will turn the call over to Moray.
Moray Dewhurst: Thank you Amanda and good morning everyone. NextEra Energy delivered strong performance in the fourth quarter capping off an outstanding year overall. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share grew 8.4% while full year adjusted earnings per share growth was 6.6% even including a negative impact of $0.15 per share associated with the launch of NEP.  Just as important, we made excellent progress on our major capital initiatives and energy resources had one of its best years ever in terms of new project origination, signing contracts for roughly 1,400 megawatts of new renewable projects as well as partnering with EQT to begin development to the Mountain Valley Pipeline. As a result, we’re very well positioned for future growth and can reasonably expect to be able to extend our long-term track record of growing adjusted earnings in the 5% to 7% range at least through 2018. Cash flow from operations grew 7.8% leading to a slight improvement in our cash flow coverage metrics as expected and we maintained our strong credit position which remains an important competitive advantage in a capital intensive industry. In addition to all these developments, 2014 saw the very successful launch of NEP the initial assets which delivered operating and financial performance in line with expectations. A favorable development of energy resources contracted renewable portfolio coupled with other factors led us to conclude that it makes sense to accelerate the growth of the NEP portfolio in 2015 and we now expect to reach the so called high slits which implies LP unit distributions at an annualized rate of $1.13 by the end of this year. Late in December, the growth potential of energy resources and by extension NEP was further supported by the federal government’s action to extend the Wind PTC program another year which we expect will mean that we will be able to offer our customers very attractive pricing on Wind projects with delivery dates through the end of 2016. Longer-term, we continue to believe the growth potential for renewables will be strong, supported by both improving economics and the EPAs Queens power plant.  All in all, it was an exceptionally strong year with excellent current financial performance balanced with equally positive developments in terms of future growth potential. We’re very pleased with the progress we have made. Now let’s turn to the results for the quarter and the full year. For the fourth quarter of 2014, FPL reported net income of $286 million or $0.65 per share up $0.08 per share year-over-year. For the full year 2014, FPL reported net income of 1.5 billion or 345 per share up $0.29 per share versus 2013. As a reminder our 2013 results included a negative impact of approximately $0.07 from transition costs associated with project momentum, our enterprise wide productivity initiative. The principle drivers of growth our continued investment in the business and increased wholesale volumes associated with two long-term contracts. FPLs capital expenditures were approximately $832 million in the quarter bringing our full year capital investments to a total of roughly $3.1 billion and driving year-over-year growth and regulatory capital employed of 5.8%. We achieved significant milestones throughout the year bringing into service the Riviera Beach Clean Energy Center ahead of schedule and slightly below budget, starting construction on our generation modernization project at Port Everglades and continuing to invest in our transmission and distribution network to help us improve our already outstanding system reliability. Our regulatory ROE for the 12 months ended December 2014 will be approximately 11.5% achieving the 2014 target that we shared with you previously. As a reminder there is no longer an embedded negative impact to transition cost associated with project momentum. Under the current rate agreement you will recall that we record reserve amortization entries to achieve the pre-determined regulatory ROE in this case the 11.5% that I previously mentioned.  During the fourth quarter, we reduced our accumulative utilization of reserve amortization since 2013 from $155 million to $122 million, a reversal of $33 million leading us a balance of $278 million which can be utilized in 2015 and 2016. Relative to the expectations that we discussed on the last call, the smaller reversal reflects the unfavorable impact of mild weather in the fourth quarter on revenues. However, the $278 million remaining balance is better than we expected when the rate agreement began primarily as a result of our productivity initiatives which have been very successful. Total non-fuel base O&M costs in 2014 were more than $100 million below where we were in 2012.  Looking ahead, we expect the balance of the reserve amortization coupled with our weather-normalized sales growth forecast at 1.5% to 2% per year and current CapEx and O&M expectations will allow us to support a regulatory ROE of approximately 11.5% in 2015 and in the upper half of the allowed band of 9.5% to 11.5% through the end of our current rate agreement. We’re continually working hard to find new ways to strengthen the value proposition that we deliver to our customers and I’d like to provide updates on three recent positive developments.  First, in December, the Florida Public Service Commission approved Woodford project portion of our gas reserves petition and important long-term hedging opportunity against potential volatility in the market price for natural gas. We expect the PSC to decide in March on our proposed guidelines for subsequent investments in natural gas supplies. Second, 2014 was the second year of FPL’s current rate agreement and the second year for the gas and power optimization program that we proposed as part of that agreement which of course the PSC approved. I’m pleased to report that under this innovative gain sharing program FPL delivered roughly 54 million of incremental value to its customers through optimization activities and once reviewed and approved by the commission we’ll be able to record roughly 13 million of incremental pre-tax income in 2015 under the gain share and provisions. This is an obvious example of a win-win proposition. Third, we remain optimistic that there is greater potential for additional utility scale solar projects in Florida. Our recent focus has been on improving the economics of three roughly 74 megawatt solar PV projects on which we have already done significant development work and which we expect we’ll be able to enter service in 2016 and qualify for the 30% ITC. I’m pleased to report that yesterday we issued a press release confirming that we believe we can now move forward with these three projects with overall economic benefits to our customers. The total capital investment for these three projects is expected to be approximately $400 million to $420 million.  Florida’s economy continues to improve in 2014 and again did better than the U.S. average on most major measures. Florida’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in December was 5.6% down 0.7 percentage points from a year earlier and in line with that with of the nation. However, Florida’s labor force participation rate also increased as more people were attracted to healthier employment market. Florida added 230,000 jobs over the 12 months period ending December 2014 largely within the private sector. The corresponding growth rates in jobs are 3% outpaced that of the nation by 0.9 percentage points. In fact, Florida’s rate of job creation outpaced the U.S. and the majority of individual private sectors reflecting diversified growth. Florida’s population is also growing at a healthy rate. U.S. Census Bureau reported recently the Florida’s population increased by more than 290,000 people over the 12 month period that ended July 1st of last year reaching 19.9 million and moving Florida ahead of New York as America’s third largest state. In the housing market, the Case-Shiller index of South Florida shows prices up 9.5% from prior year and building permits appears to be stabilizing at healthy levels. The strengthening economy was reflected improvements in Florida’s Consumer Sentiment Index which by the end of the year reached its highest level since February 2007.  Fourth quarter sales volume was down 3.7% driven by mild weather. FPL’s average number of customers increased by approximately 68,000 or 1.5% compared to the prior year period with a roughly comparable estimated impact to change in sales of 1.4%. As a reminder, the remote connect and disconnect capability enabled by a smart meters was fully deployed by the fourth quarter 2013 consequently none of the fourth quarter 2014 customer growth is attributed to this impact. Usage per customer declined by 5% compared to the prior year with weather accounting for 5.3% of the decrease offset by a 0.3% increase in underlying usage growth. In the fourth quarter, inactive accounts were roughly 15% below the level of the prior year comparable period and new meter connections continue to show steady improvement by increasing almost 47,000 in 2014 which is over 20% higher than the 2013 additions. For the full year, customer growth in mix increased by 1.2% compared to 2013, year-over-year we have a normalized usage of a customer increased slightly by 0.1%. This metric was somewhat volatile in 2014 but our long-term expectation remains at approximately 0.5% for year net of the impact of efficiency and conservation programs through the period of the rate agreement and flat thereafter.  Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported fourth quarter 2014 GAAP earnings of $614 million or a $39 per share. Adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter were $178 million or $0.40 per share. Energy Resources contribution to adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter was flat compared to last year. Strong positive contributions from the new investments as well as improvements in customer supply and trading were offset by reductions in gas infrastructure largely driven by higher depletion rates and by the impact of refueling outages at our Duane Arnold and Point Beach nuclear facilities.  For the full year 2014, Energy Resources reported GAAP earnings of $985 million or 2.24 per share. Adjusted earnings were $833 million or 1.89 per share. As a reminder adjusted results include the negative impact of $0.15 per share associated with establishing and launching NEP. This in turn includes a $0.10 per share non-cash income tax charge driven by separating our Canadian projects to enable and to fit into the overall NEP structure.  The growth in Energy Resources contribution to adjusted earnings per share of $0.06 for the full year was driven largely by growth in our contract in renewables portfolio which added $0.29 per share. During the year, we installed roughly 1364 megawatts of new wind and 265 megawatts at new solar making 2014 the strongest year ever for new renewable capacity coming into service. We elected CITC for roughly 265 megawatts in solar projects in 2014 compared to approximately 280 megawatts in projects in 2013. We expect to elect CITCs on roughly 365 megawatts in new solar generation in 2050.  Contributions from our existing business were up $0.06 per share year-over-year. Wind resource for 2014 was slightly above our long-term expectations following a slightly lower resource in 2013. Customer supply and trading overall ended the year-up $0.04 per share, asset sales added $0.01 per share year-over-year. Offsetting these increases were the $0.06 decline in gas infrastructure mainly due to increased depreciation expense primarily related to higher depletion rates.  Increased interest expense negatively affected the comparison to last year by $0.09 per share due to growth in the business. Contributions from corporate G&A and other decreased $0.04 per share year-over-year primarily driven by share dilution.  As we did last year, we have included a summary in the Appendix to the presentation that compares Energy Resources realized equivalent EBITDA to the ranges we provided in the third quarter or 2013. In addition, we have updated Energy Resources projected adjusted-EBITDA and cash flow slides and included an additional year forward. The portfolio of financial information for 2015 and 2016 can be found in the Appendix to the presentation.  Please note that the slides now reflect the impact of the anticipated accelerated growth at NEP. All expectations associated with NEP assume the future training yields roughly comparable to the day’s level.  Energy Resources financial performance in 2014 was stronger than they appear from the simple calculation of adjusted-EPS growth in part because of the impact of the various costs and accounting charges associated with the establishment of NextEra Energy partners. Growth in the adjusted-EBITDA and cash flow both strong with adjusted-EBITDA growing by 12% and operating cash flow by 29% although the later number is affected by intercompany tax effects and working capital changes.  The strong growth in Energy Resources cash flow reflects the impact of new contracted renewable projects coming into service.  As I mentioned earlier Energy Resources had one of our best ever periods of origination activity for new contracted renewable in 2014. On the last quarterly call we discussed a number of strong prospects that the team was pursuing and I am pleased to report that since that time we have added roughly 500 megawatts to our backlog of wind and solar projects. All of these new projects have characteristics that we expect will make them attractive candidates to be made available to NEP over the course of time.  We are now well ahead of the expectations that we share with you at on March 2013 investor conference with positive implications for earnings and cash flow growth in 2017 and beyond. Contingent upon IRF guidance, we believe that the extension of the wind PTC along with our development activities and efforts to Safe Harbor equipment should be supportive to our U.S. program through 2016. The accompanying chart shows our current estimates of megawatts that can be delivered and their respective period. Over the last two years, we’ve brought into service approximately 2,285 megawatts of new renewable. And in addition, we have signed contract for another roughly 2,115 megawatts which we expect to bring into service by the end of 2016. If our development program goes as expected, we believe energy resources and NEPs combined renewable portfolios will reach at least 14,200 megawatts by the end of 2016 and likely will be significantly higher. We will provide a more detailed update on our origination and development activities at our March investor conference. Let me now review the highlights for NEP, as you know the launch of NEP came at the end of the second quarter consequently a discussion of full year results is not meaningful and we will instead simply focus on the fourth quarter. As a reminder NEP consolidates 100% of the assets and operations of NEE operating LP in which both NextEra Energy and NEP LP unit holders hold an ownership interest. Accordingly the financial values for NEP that we discussed in these prepared remarks or in the attached slides are presented on a 100% basis. At present NextEra Energy owns approximately 80% of the economic interest and NEP LP unit holders own approximately 20%. NEPs initial portfolio delivered fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA and CAFD of 54 million and 32 million respectively. The assets operated well, wind and solar resource were normal and financial results were generally aligned with our expectations. During the quarter, NEP also made its initial distribution payment to unit holders. Earlier this month, NEP completed the acquisition of Palo Duro the first of two previously announced agreements to expand its portfolio through project acquisitions for NextEra Energy Resources. Palo Duro is an approximately 250 megawatt wind project in Texas. It ended service in December 2014 and sell 100% of its output under a 20 year PPA. NEP paid approximately $228 million in cash consideration excluding post-closing, working capital and other adjustments and assumed a differential membership liability of approximately $248 million. NEP continues to expect a first quarter 2015 closing of its agreement to acquire Shafter, a 20 megawatt contracted solar project currently under construction in California for an estimated cash consideration of 64 million. As discussed on the third quarter call, these acquisitions are being funded by cash on hand including the 150 million of primary proceeds retained from the IPO and a draw on NEPs existing revolving credit facility. We expect to issue equity in order to support longer-term financing needs at some point in 2015. Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy; for the fourth quarter of 2014, GAAP net income attributable both to NextEra Energy was 884 million or $2 per share. NextEra Energy’s 2014 fourth quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $458 million and $1.03 respectively. For the full year 2014, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $2.5 billion or 5.60 per share, adjusted earnings were roughly $2.3 billion or 5.30 per share. For the quarter corporate and other segment was flat relative to 2013 on an adjusted EPS basis, for the full year the corporate and other segment was down $0.02 per share on an adjusted basis from 2013. On the development front, 2014 was a successful year for our pipeline projects, the development of both Sabal Trail Transmission and Florida Southeast connection continue to progress well through their respective processes and both projects submitted the necessary filings with FERC in 2014 and are on track to receive FERC approval in 2015 in support of a mid-2017 commercial operations date as scheduled. The Mountain Valley Pipeline joint venture with EQT Corporation continues to progress through the permitting process with the FERC application targeted for the fourth quarter of 2015. The project has secured approximately 2 bcf per day, a 20-year firm capacity commitments with an expected capital opportunity for NextEra of 1.0 billion to 1.3 billion. The project is expected to be operational by year-end 2018. NextEra Energy’s operating cash flow growth outpaced EPS growth year-over-year and our overall credit metrics improved and are in line with our expectations and consistent with our ratings. In the appendix of today’s presentation we have provided actual performance for 2013 and 2014 as well as our projections for 2015. Additionally you will see the corresponding ranges for the rating agencies indicate for those metrics at our ratings. Approximately 15 billion of financing transactions were executed in 2014 by our treasury team to support the growth of our business. As usual we employed conventional debt issuances and continued to make use of project level debt and tax equity partnerships at energy resources. Consistent with our well established strategy of recycling capital, proceeds generated through the inter relationships between NextEra Energy and NEP introduced another source of capital integrated into NextEra’s ongoing financing program. In light of the progress made against our execution objectives, we continue to be comfortable with the 2015 adjusted EPS expectations we shared with you last quarter 5.40 to 5.70 per share. For 2016, we are updating our expectations to a range of 5.75 to 6.25 and we expect to be able to provide more insight into the drivers of earnings and cash flows for 2016 and beyond at our Investor Conference in March. As always our expectations are subject to the usual caveats including but not limited to normal weather and operating conditions. Turning now to NEP; our expectations taking into account all the asset acquisitions we are now contemplating are unchanged since the last call. For the full year 2015, we continue to expect the NEP portfolio to grow to generate adjusted EBITDA of $400 million to $440 million and CAFD of $100 million to $120 million, this would support the distribution level at an annualized rate of approximately $1.13, which corresponds to the upper tier of the IDR splits by the end of 2015 or possibly slightly earlier. After 2015, we continue to see 12% to 15% per year growth in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations for at least the next five years.  Assuming current trading levels, this implies 2016 adjusted EBITDA of 580 million to 620 million and 2016 CAFD of 170 million to 190 million. That concludes our prepared remarks and we’ll now open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We’ll take our first from Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.
Dan Eggers : Thanks for the update. I guess question number one, Jim has been pointing to the idea that your 2016 would be a disappointment if it wasn't at $6. What do you guys, when you saw the guidance increase today, can you just talk about what you saw to give you confidence to move that number higher?
Moray Dewhurst: First of all we’ve had really since the investor conference the prior range of $5.50 to $6 so that was based on the initiatives that we laid out for you at time since then we have enable to push forward and execute successfully on I would say the vast majority of those initiatives and we indicated as we went longer way that we were feeling better about where we might be within that range. Separately, Jim very clearly articulated charge to the organization the challenge to the organization being at the $6 range hence the comment about being disappointed that we didn’t get that. And then in the third quarter we simply indicated that we would try and update now once we got pass the Florida election and had a chance to roll the numbers up again. So all that is preamble to say that based on the success we’ve had since laying out those capital initiatives in March of 2013, we now think that centering the range around that $6 mark is very consistent with our normal method that’s coming up with our expectation. So always we’re telling you what it is we see today we could be literally anywhere within that band but we think that band is appropriate given all the factors that we can see today.
Dan Eggers : Okay. And I guess, Moray, just on the wind additions and the warehousing of additional equipment to qualify for the PTC, can you just walk through what you guys are doing to key that up and then how we should think about the ability to sustain beyond what is contracted additional wind growth for 2015 and 2016?
Jim Robo : I’ll ask Armando to comment on the specifics on the development side but just the general context I’d say on the number of occasions that would see extension which congress now passed, we felt comfortable that that would provide us good opportunities for projects that through the end of 2016 and also said that if they were no further extension of the PTC we might well see a drop off in new development for a while but we would expect even without PTC extension to see development pick up again later in the decade is the influence of improving economics and EPA’s Clean power plant come into play so just with that is general context Armando you want to comment on what we’re doing in specific development activities to make sure that we can get them in by the end of ‘16.
Armando Pimentel: Right. So couple of things, first, we’re on I know we gave you these numbers on a quarterly basis but we’re on what I would consider a pretty decent role with our development activities in the renewable side so over the last couple of years we’ve signed long-term power purchase agreements for wind and solar that are just above 2900 megawatts of that 2900 Morey pointed out in the slides this morning that some of those will build in 2014 but we still at 2115 I believe the number is in megawatts, for contracts that we have in hand that will go COD in 2015 and 2016. That number does not include any potential for wind projects in 2016. We believe that the IRS is going to provide some more guidance on this PTC as they did last time. We hope that will be provided before the Investor Conference in March and at that time we will share with you what our expectations on the wind side, but it clearly would be a giant disappointment if we have zero megawatts in 2016. I just don’t think that’s going to happen.  On the solar front, really over the last 12 months to 18 months we have done very well in that market. I think it’s still way too early to talk about what’s going to happen with tax credits for solar beyond 2016. And as such we probably have just a couple of more orders here where we and others will be able to signed folks up for long-term agreements on the solar side, but we have got several very promising opportunities on the solar side that I hope will paying out.  To give you an indication though of what we have been doing 2014 was also our highest ever year in terms of bringing renewal energy megawatts COD. In 2014 we brought 1630 megawatts of COD. So we clearly have the capabilities to do that, and I hope we would do that. I am certainly not committing to that but we will have more information for you in March. 
Dan Eggers : That's great. And just to clarify one thing, that 980 MW of wind that you have on slide 11, that would be all for 2015 delivery because you do not have clarity on the 2016 from the IRS yet, is that correct? 
Armando Pimentel: Yes. 
Operator: Now we will take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. 
Julien Dumoulin-Smith : So I wanted to follow up on the solar announcement in Florida and just explore that a little bit further. First, can you expand a little bit on the regulatory process involved? Obviously you have kind of alluded to it and tried it a little bit in the past, but what mechanisms precisely you are looking for, what kind of recovery you are looking for? And then subsequently just in terms of the timing, can you talk about the ability to scale this up, or what total size do you see ultimately in Florida? I know you delineated at least the first batch here, but is there an ability to scale this up similarly as you described gas before in the state? 
Moray Dewhurst : True. On the first part, the regulatory needs to be recovered through base rates. So we have been working hard to make sure that we can deliver customer value by which I mean make the addition positive to our total system economics in the current environment. I am not surprising that has been working very hard on getting the initial cost down because that’s where so much of the economics part. And so we have now reached that point so since these projects have positive economics for customer we believe it’s appropriate to go forward and in due course we will recover them through basic rates.  On the second part of the question, there is some special characteristics of these projects that make them particularly attractive right now and we can’t quite yet see general scaling that up to much larger size, we are going to need some further improvements in the economics these are also assisted by the fact that we are going to benefit from the existing 30% ITC. So there is a question always about future projects from that perspective. So the answer to your second part of your question is, yes, we think there is huge potential longer-term, but we think what we need to get a little bit further still on the economics before we can go much beyond three projects that we are talking about here. 
Julien Dumoulin-Smith : Great. Excellent. And then coming to Hawaii, could you give us a little bit of an update on where you stand? Just as I imagine you have had conversations with folks in the state, I mean how do you feel about being able to execute that both from a timeline perspective and also just in terms of anything you might have to provide to get it all executed?
Moray Dewhurst : Sure, Jim will have a couple of words. 
Jim Robo : Julien, obviously its early days. The teams are working on the SEC filings as well as the Hawaii PUC filing for regulatory approval, and things are moving a pace. And as I said its early days and I remain optimistic that we are going to be able to finalize things within a 12 months period here by the end of the year. 
Julien Dumoulin-Smith : Great. And just a last detail, any updates on the rate base effort in Florida? Obviously you've got the first gas approval here, but just any issues or any changes in the program as you look towards getting the rest done?
Moray Dewhurst : Really no change. Obviously pleased that they approved this specific project they will take up a question of the guidelines in March.
Operator: And we’ll go next to Paul Ridzon from KeyBanc.
Paul Ridzon: If we look at the midpoint of your 2016 guidance, are you just kind of using the forward gas curves as they currently sit? 
Moray Dewhurst: Yes, all our expectations are always based on current forward curves both for commodities and for interest rates. And every time as part of our preparation for these quarterly calls we go through an update to that outlook we update all the major driving assumptions in which the commodity curves are won. So yes they recognize those curves bouncing around literally every day.
Paul Ridzon: Right. On play, you have a $0.50 range, I guess?
Moray Dewhurst: We’ll that’s one of the big factors, that causes the need for the range certainly.
Paul Ridzon: And Moray, over the past couple of years, you have kind of expanded your reach across the energy platform be it pipeline, gas reserves. Are there anything else on the back burner we need to look at as far as potential opportunities? 
Moray Dewhurst: I mean certainly we’re always looking to see whether there are logical extensions that flow from the current scale set and current opportunity set. But I think we have articulated to you and to others pretty clearly the ones that we’re active in at the moment, so obviously core is the power that we have extensive knowledge of the gas business build that over time, very capable at doing all kinds of large scale development in construction and infrastructure type projects, transmission development and definitely a focus. The other one that I probably should remind everybody is that we have a small effort going in storage in a variety of different aspects from sort of early stage, following early stage R&D, early stage production companies to actual projects have completed or have in process. So that’s kind of the suite of opportunities at the moment.
Paul Ridzon: You’re talking electricity storage?
Moray Dewhurst: Correct.
Operator: Now we’ll go to next Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research.
Steven Fleishman: A couple of quick questions. First, if you look at this year, I think you came in around $5.30, and if you added back the $0.15 of one timers of the NEP restructuring, you are almost kind of in your range for 2015 just doing that. Just to kind of round out 2015, is there anything that particularly hits this year -- kind of limits the uptick?
Moray Dewhurst: No I would say it’s the other way around, so let me just talk a little bit about ‘14. Why were we able to exceed our original expectations even while absorbing $0.15 of incremental and unanticipated at the time charges? There are a number of reasons, most of them frankly having to do with the energy resources portfolio, most parts of which ended up doing a little better than we originally expected. First we had just plain weather solar resource was better than long-term averages that was probably about $0.08 worth of goodness from that. Interest rates stayed lower than we - because of the implied responsible earlier we locked them to curve but that curve didn’t manifest itself over the years was probably corporate wide probably about $0.04 of goodness from there. And then the other big one was really performance in the northeast, so the NEPOOL portfolio was on the order of $0.10 or so better than we expected even more than compensating for the shortfall that we had in the customer supply business in the first quarter in the northeast and that business in turn made up that big short fall over the rest of the course of the year. So you add up all those different things and there was probably somewhere around the order of $0.24 to $0.30 of unanticipated goodness now to be fair there was also some unanticipated badness on smaller factors. But that was kind of the difference, so again when we do the expectations we just go back to sort of base line normal expectations where the commodity curves are right now. So it’s much more and that’s how ’15, son it’s much more matter of fact that we got $0.20 in the sense of unanticipated goodness in ’14 that we can’t automatically expect will carry over into ’15. We hope it will but we can’t count on it.
Steven Fleishman: Okay. And just on 2016 guidance in terms of the renewable backlog, should we assume what you lay out here that is already contracted gets you maybe to the midpoint, and if you are able to do more, that's how you get toward the higher end? 
Moray Dewhurst: No absolutely not, we’ve covered this actually on a number of occasions. The stuff that we’re doing now in new development is not going to have a significant impact until we reach ‘17 ‘18, in fact for the last year pretty the development effort is generating projects but that’s really going to help us in ‘17 ‘18 and beyond. So there maybe some slight timing impacts on ‘16 that’s not really going to be a big driver of where we are in the ‘16 range.
Steven Fleishman: Okay, great. And then finally -- 
Unidentified Company Representative : Just remember that historically when we build wind we get virtually all of the COD very, very late in the year. So when you’re building we don’t have anything new for ‘16 wind but we certainly hope to build some and I’d love to be able to build them in January, February, March but traditionally we put those in very, very late in the year, so there is just very little EBITDA that goes into the year. And on the solar front we’re getting to the point really at this point where it’s going to be very difficult to sign contracts over the next couple of months and expect that you’ll be have a COD at anything other than very, very late in 2016. So that’s why we just go back and look at history when we go in COD it’s very late in the year and really affects the future year’s earnings.
Steven Fleishman: Great. One last question. Just I think in the beginning of your remarks, you kind of reiterated the 5% to 7% I guess through 2018. But it does seem like your 2016 kind of got you effectively high-end or above that range. So just can you just maybe context the 2016 guidance with the 5% to 7%? 
Moray Dewhurst : ‘16, the percent of that range 6% is squarely within the 5% to 7% back from 2012. 
Operator:
. :
Michael Lapides: Congrats on a good 2014. I wanted to ask a P&L question. The commentary about staying above the midpoint or towards the higher end of the range in 2016, meeting the authorized ROE band, can you talk a little bit about what headwinds, if any, exist at FPL? You're highlighting really strong expected but weather normalized demand growth, and you have a lot of the regulatory amorts kind of in your back pocket to use over the next few years. Just trying to think about things that could offset those.
Moray Dewhurst : There is nothing in particular but recognize when we started out with the rate agreement, the beginning of the rate agreement looking forward in general you’re going to need to utilize little more surplus depreciation in the out years to maintain a given level of profitability just given the fundamental growth in the regulatory capital deployed. So there is nothing special we just again doing the same thing we’re taking a best view of the range of possibilities for 2016 revenue including where the variability against that expectations for 2016 cost, CapEx et cetera and the amount of surplus depreciation remaining. And all of those give us comfort that in ‘16 we can be at least above the mid-point of the formal range that somewhere between 10.5 and 11.5. 
Michael Lapides: Got it. And I know we will see this in the K and probably at the analyst day, but any insight you can give us on 2015 and 2016 CapEx expectations at just FP&L?
Moray Dewhurst : Again I differ on that one because I don’t the specific data in front of me. The K will be out pretty soon.
Jim Robo : Michael this is Jim the other thing I would say is that we’re going to layout in good detail our capital plans at FPL in the March Investor Conference on both sides of the business.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI.
Greg Gordon : Armando, I just want to make sure I heard correctly that practically speaking when I look at slide 11 and I look at the backlog for wind in the United States, you said that that doesn't have anything in 2016, so that 980 MW is really just all delivery in 2015. Is that right? 
Armando Pimentel: Yes, that’s correct and let me just clarify the point, that is correct right, and all of those 980 megawatts that you see on there we have committed to with the customer to bring those in before the end of 2015, if for some reason the customer comes back to us and said okay, now that we feel comfortable about 2015 and just slip into ‘16 we’ll obviously do that but what I really meant to say is we have signed no contracts right now none of the numbers that you see on here are based on a contract that we signed for 2016 COD.
Greg Gordon : That looks really good because your backlog went up from like 1860 MW to 2254 MW since the third quarter, and you still have good option on 2016 if you get the extension.
Armando Pimentel: Yes.
Greg Gordon : Is based on looking at those slides in the last quarter to today?
Moray Dewhurst : Yes, absolutely it has been a great period.
Greg Gordon : Shifting to another question, it has become a smaller and smaller piece of variability in your business, but the Texas market has obviously been under some duress in terms of gas prices coming down but also heat rates contracting in the wake of new supply additions and concern over the economy in Texas with oil prices having come down as much as they have. I know your guidance on 2015 EBITDA and cash flow has moderated a bit. Can you talk about market conditions there and maybe what you have done to hedge out that risk? 
Moray Dewhurst : Amanda may want to comment as well, but I would say that in general on the commodity front oil, gas and power nothing much great has happened recently and that definitely includes Texas. In the short-term because we do hedge expensively is a relatively modest impact, but I would certainly tell that my personal view of the Texas market is less bullish than it was. Amanda?
Amanda Finnis : I will add just a couple of more to that. When I look at our Texas assets it’s divided into three sets of assets. You have got Lumber Yard in Forney that 2800 megawatts combined cycle. You have got roughly 1800 megawatts of what we hedged wind and you have us much smaller 400 megawatts or 500 megawatts or so of contracted wind in Texas. The hedged wind really the first time that any significant hedges on the hedge wind start rolling off as 2017 and that’s not very significant portion, you have got hedges after 2020 to start rolling off. So I don’t worry in the near-term that much about the due to hedged portfolio, hedged wind portfolio or contracted wind portfolio.  As Moray mentioned on the combined cycle gas assets, we have leveraged those assets last year and part of what we did was we went out and hedged a good part of the margin for about 2.5 years and we have been legging into additional hedges when we can. That’s a market that does not have a lot of liquidity really past 2016 and even in 2016 it’s not like you can just hit the bid that you see on the screen. So it’s not something I am concerned about at all in the near-term but longer-term economics as Moray said on the market. I am certainly not as bullish as I was couple of years ago. 
Operator: And we will go next to Hugh Wynne with Sanford Bernstein. 
Hugh Wynne: Moray, you had emphasized in your presentation today the improvement in cash flow from operations and EBITDA, which was stronger even than the growth in earnings. Was wondering if you could drill down into that a little bit and just give us a feel for the primary drivers there and what were the differences with the growth in earnings? 
Moray Dewhurst : Sure, the Energy Resources level, I think the main observation to make is simply that the strong contributions to cash flow coming from these contracted renewable projects gets a little bit particularly in the early years by some other factors. So, I described two things, first of all simply in 2014 we had a number of non-cash items that affect earnings of which the largest and simply the impact in some of the NEP merge cost which obviously we would not picks back to continue. So that’s one source of difference between the picture that you will get if you look at earnings growth and the picture you get if you look at cash growth. But there is the more fundamental one is that by the nature of these contracted renewable projects you have virtually all of your investment upfront. And so in a sense the faster you grow that business the greater the disparity between your earnings profile, the impact that has on your earnings profile and your underlying cash flow profile. So the growth in the cash flow is coming from the project is kind of must in the early years by the fact that they not has accretive in the early years as they will be in subsequent years.  So there is just a, it’s almost like an arithmetical, mathematical thing goes on. So we simply wanted to highlight the fact that the cash flow growth of Energy Resources is very strong and just a flag for people that you probably want to look most that its contribution to earnings and its contribution to cash flow. 
Hugh Wynne: Okay. And if I could, just a quick follow-up on the solar initiative at FPL. If I remember correctly, those were three 75 MW projects, and you are estimating a cost of $400 million to $420 million? Is that correct? 
Moray Dewhurst: Correct. 
Hugh Wynne: And then you are saying that the economics would need to improve for the growth in utility scale and solar to continue? Can you amplify on that at all what you think would be sort of an economic cost per watt for utility scale solar? 
Jim Robo : Well, recognize that those projects are advantaged by couple of things. First of all eligibility for the 30% ITC and secondly I will call it good fighting condition. So development work has been done, access to transmission et cetera. So if you just look at the generic, supposing I wanted to add 200 plus megawatts of solar somewhere in Florida. You got to start from a clean-slate, find a new site, get transmission access all of those things, look at the full cost of the project. That would not be economic today at the 10% ITC level, so answer to the direct question of how much more do cost have to come down, I would have to look more closely at the economics I’m going a little bit off memory, but yes I would think somewhere in the order of 10% to 15%. And we certainly think that that’s likely to occur over the next few years, so again we’re very optimistic about doing more later in the decade.
Jim Robo : Hugh this is Jim. The only other thing I’d say is we’re very pleased within this historically low price commodity environment that we have some utility scale solar projects in Florida that are cost effective for customers. And so that 10% or 15% improvement going forward to offset the loss of the ITC and some of the special advantages that these projects have, one of the ways to do that is to have commodity prices come up a little bit, right. And we’re seeing this throughout the country now that solar is becoming increasingly cost effective -- utility scale solar is becoming increasingly cost effective compared to avoided cost at utilities around the country and I think that’s a very-very positive thing for our customers here in Florida and also for Armando's renewable business across the rest of the country.
Moray Dewhurst : And just as a reminder to everyone really, the challenge of making solar work here in Florida is actually quite a bit more than it might appear because of a low cost structure and hence low rate structure which is effectively what we’re competing against.
Operator: And we’ll take our final question today from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie.
Angie Storozynski: So first on the growth in your wind power installations, we have heard from other wind developers in the US who seem pretty confident that the projects that will start operations before the end of 2017 will still qualify for the PTC given the extension through the end of 2014. You seem to believe it is only until 2016. So where is the difference? Are you simply conservative in your assumptions or do you think that it is really still unclear given the lack of the IRS interpretation? 
Moray Dewhurst : Angie assuming that the IRS provides similar guidance to what they did last year on in construction. We think that, that will mean, these are my words Safe Harbor or projects that would get COD before January 01 of 2017. There is always been the question out there that because the IRS or Congress that the IRS is just interpreting, did not provide a what I will call a drop dead bed on COD that if you have continuous construction activities through the period of COD that you could qualify for the production tax credit beyond again what I call my Safe Harbor day. So I some folks are saying look, we can build at some point in 2017 because we believe it will have, we will meet continuing guidance and the IRS has provided some examples of what those activities are, that is I think that’s certainly doable, that’s certainly a more aggressive interpretation than we would take. Now we may have some projects just because of their circumstances that we would feel comfortable building in 2017 to build -- I am sorry to meet that IRS guidance. But I can tell you we will try to minimize those projects because we think they carry more of a risk than those projects to get done by the end of 2016. 
Angie Storozynski: Okay. And then separately on NEP, so I just wanted to clarify one thing. So if you are talking about 12% to 15% growth in distributions per share, you are assuming that you will be able to issue equity for each of the forward years assuming that the yield at the time of the issuance will be close to the 2.8%, 2.9% that we are currently observing using the projections of the distributed cash per share? Is that correct? 
Jim Robo : Yes, they doesn’t necessarily have to be exactly that, but that’s why we included the comment about the assuming roughly current trading levels. Yes. 
Operator: And at this time, that does conclude today’s presentation. We thank you for your participation.

===== 2014 Q3  (2014-11-02 08:00:00) =====
Executives:  Amanda Finnis – IR Moray Dewhurst – Vice Chairman and CFO Armando Pimentel President and CEO, NextEra Energy Resources, LLC Jim Robo – Chairman and CEO
Analysts:  Stephen Byrd – Morgan Stanley Dan Eggers – Credit Suisse Steven Fleishman – Wolfe Research Julien Dumoulin-Smith – UBS Shar Pourreza – Citigroup Greg Gordon – ISI Group Paul Patterson – Glenrock Associates 
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners’ Conference Call. Today’s conference is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Amanda Finnis.
Amanda Finnis: Thank you, Hanna. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the third quarter 2014 combined conference call for NextEra Energy and for NextEra Energy Partners. With me this morning are Jim Robo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; Moray Dewhurst, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; Armando Pimentel, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources, all of whom are also officers of NextEra Energy Partners, as well as Eric Silagy, President and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light Company. Moray will provide an overview and our executive team will then be available to answer your questions. We will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward- looking statements, if any of our key assumptions are correct or because of other factors discussed in today’s release, in the comments made during this conference call, in the risk factors section of the accompanying presentation, or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found on our websites www.nexteraenergy.com and www.nexteraenergypartners.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. Today’s presentation also references to non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to information contained in the slides accompanying today’s presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of the non-GAAP measure to the closest GAAP financial measure. With that, I will turn the call over to Moray.
Moray Dewhurst: Thank you, Amanda, and good morning everyone. NextEra Energy had a very good third quarter with strong performance at both FPL and Energy Resources. At Florida Power & Light, earnings per share increased approximately 6% over the prior year comparable quarter, driven roughly equally by our continued commitment of new capital to the business and by growth in wholesale power sales. Operationally, our performance was strong despite a challenging period of summer weather, as our investments in our transmission and distribution network are helping us deliver improvements in our system reliability. We continue to make good progress on the third of three generation modernization projects, at Port Everglades, which remains on track to achieve commercial operation in mid-2016. Our gas reserves petition advanced through the regulatory process and we expect the Public Service Commission to consider the matter in early December, which we expect will permit a decision either late this year or early next year. Also during the quarter, the Florida Supreme Court unanimously affirmed the Commission’s decision to approve our 2012 rate case settlement. The court’s order comprehensively rejected all the arguments raised by The Office of Public Counsel and made it very clear that, as long as the PSC follows appropriate procedures, as it did in 2012, it has wide latitude to determine whether a settlement agreement is in the public interest, taking account of all the prevailing facts and circumstances. We believe this is a very positive development that will encourage and support our efforts to negotiate future settlement agreements that, like the 2012 agreement have new and innovative elements in them. Energy Resources had an outstanding quarter. Adjusted earnings per share increased roughly 16% over the prior year comparable quarter, primarily as a result of additional investments in our contracted renewables business, and the business enjoyed great success in terms of new renewables origination activity, signing contracts for a total of approximately 445 megawatts of new wind and solar projects. Beyond this, we see strong prospects for signing another 600 to 800 megawatts by the end of the year. It was an excellent quarter for new origination activity, with very strong near-term prospects. At NextEra Energy Partners, operational performance during the quarter was solid and cash available for distribution was in line with our expectations. Yesterday, the NEP Board declared an initial quarterly distribution of $18.75 per common unit or $0.75 per common unit on an annualized basis. And just as important, we have made excellent progress around key decisions that will affect the future growth prospects for NEP. The Conflicts Committee of the NEP Board composed of independent directors reached agreement with the sponsor to acquire two additional assets from the Energy Resources portfolio. And more generally, we completed the first phase of our ongoing analysis of future growth, and concluded that it is in the interests of both the shareholders of NEE and the LP unitholders of NEP to undertake a short-term acceleration of the NEP growth profile, while still preserving the expectation of continued long-term growth in the 12% to 15% per year range for many years to come. I will provide more details on each of these later in the call. Overall, we are very pleased with our progress this quarter. Now let’s look at the results for FPL. For the third quarter of 2014, FPL reported net income of $462 million or $1.05 per share, up $0.06 per share year-over-year. Continued investment in the business and an expansion of wholesale operations were the two principal drivers of growth. FPL’s capital expenditures were approximately $670 million in the quarter, and we expect our full-year capital investments to be roughly $3.1 billion. Regulatory capital employed grew 5.2% over the same quarter last year. Our principal current generation initiative is the Port Everglades Energy Center, which will deliver fuel efficiency savings and emissions reductions to our customers when it enters service in 2016. This approximately $1 billion project remains on schedule and on budget. We are also focused on investing in our transmission and distribution network to improve its resilience during severe weather such as hurricanes, as well as to provide increased reliability to our customers on a daily basis. As I mentioned earlier, this year presented one of the more challenging periods of summer weather, and what we are seeing in terms of our ability to improve our already outstanding reliability is encouraging. Comparing against years that have had similarly challenging weather, we estimate that the reliability of our network measured in terms of system unavailability, has improved by 10% to 15%. This means fewer minutes of interruption for our customers and lower outage repair costs for the company. Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes for the 12 months ended September 2014 will be approximately 11.4%. As you may recall from prior quarters, this includes the impact of transition costs associated with our enterprise-wide productivity initiative, Project Momentum, incurred late last year. The impact of the 2013 transition costs will roll-off our reported regulatory ROE, as we move through the year, since the regulatory ROE is measured on a 12-month trailing basis. Absent these costs, regulatory ROE would have been 11.5%, and this remains our target for the full-year 2014. As a reminder, under the current rate agreement, we record reserve amortization entries to achieve a pre-determined regulatory ROE for each 12-month trailing period, in this case the 11.5% that I previously mentioned, excluding special charges, such as the Project Momentum transition costs. During the third quarter, we reversed all $131 million of reserve amortization that we had taken this year through June. The need for reserve amortization is generally the lowest in the third quarter, since the third quarter is typically our strongest in terms of revenue, and our non-fuel O&M expenses in the third quarter of this year were actually lower than in the third quarter of 2013, reflecting the excellent results of our productivity improvement initiative, Project Momentum. Relative to our expectations at the time we first discussed Project Momentum in the spring of 2013, we are seeing earlier delivery of results and likely greater overall savings. Incidentally, our ability to shift focus to a comprehensive multiyear effort like this is just one example of the benefits that will flow to customers over time from a settlement agreement like our 2012 rate agreement. During the fourth quarter, we expect to further reduce the amount of reserve amortization by reversing some of the amortization that was taken in 2013, the first year of the settlement agreement. As a reminder, we utilized $155 million of reserve amortization during 2013. Assuming normal weather and operating conditions, we expect to be able to reverse a third to a half of that amount in the fourth quarter. The economic recovery in Florida remains solid. A focused effort of the state’s leadership on economic development along with a consistent improvement in the business climate has helped to drive growth in employment. The number of jobs in Florida as of September was up 206,000 compared to a year earlier, an increase of 2.7%. Nearly 700,000 jobs have now been added since the bottom of the downturn in 2009. Florida’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in September was 6.1%, down 0.8 percentage points from a year ago. As an indicator of new construction, new building permits remain at healthy levels, albeit lower than their recent peak. The Case-Shiller Index in South Florida shows home prices up 10% from the prior year and mortgage delinquency rates continue to decline. Turning now to our customer and usage metrics. FPL’s average number of customers in the third quarter increased by 82,000 or 1.8%, with an estimated impact on sales of 1.2%. Similar to prior quarters, the estimated impact on sales is slightly lower than the customer count growth, because the remote connect and disconnect capability enabled by our smart meter program continues to account for a portion of that customer growth, and these new customers are disproportionately low usage and residential. We began deploying the remote connect and disconnect switches in the third quarter of 2013, and were fully deployed by the end of the fourth quarter. Consequently, we expect the growth in customer count year-over-year to revert in coming quarters to an underlying rate of about 1.3% to 1.5% percent or 60,000 to 70,000 customer additions annually. Overall usage per customer grew by 1.9%, of which, weather accounted for roughly 0.8%. Weather normalized usage per customer increased 1.1% compared to the same quarter last year. This was a very strong rebound from the year-over-year decline in the second quarter, but as we have often said, this measure can be volatile on a quarterly basis. Through the period of the rate agreement, our expectations of underlying usage growth are unchanged at approximately 0.5% per year. The average number of inactive accounts in September declined 20.8% from the prior year and the percent of inactive accounts is now at a level well below the 20-year average. As of September, the 12-month average of low usage customers fell to 8.0%, down from 8.3% in September 2013. Before leaving FPL, let me update you on the two capital initiatives that we discussed in the spring of last year, that have been pushed back a bit. First, we are continuing to monitor the actual emissions profile of our peaking units in Broward County. Based on the results of this testing, we will determine what the most cost-effective upgrade path will be for our customers. We continue to expect the need to modernize and upgrade these assets, but the exact size and scope of the project remains uncertain. Construction is not likely to start before 2016. Second, since completing our first 110 megawatts of solar in Florida, we have been working hard to identify ways in which we can cost-effectively introduce more solar capacity into our system. Distributed solar, especially residential, remains extremely high cost relative to our efficient generation fleet, and will only serve to drive up customer rates if pursued in any quantity. Even utility-scale solar, which is by far the most cost-efficient way of adding renewable energy in our service territory, is not yet at a stage to be generally cost-effective across our entire service territory. However, we have continued to work to identify specific opportunities and now believe we can bring forward three roughly 75 megawatt solar PV projects that can take advantage of the 2016 ITC window, leverage available land, transmission capacity, as well as prior permitting and development work, and that will prove cost-effective for our customers. We expect to bring these projects into service in 2016. Moreover, we continue to believe that with reasonably foreseeable continued improvements in solar economics, there could be greater potential for utility-scale solar by the end of the decade. Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported third quarter 2014 GAAP earnings of $204 million or $0.46 per share. Adjusted earnings for the third quarter were $231 million or $0.52 per share. Before reviewing the details, let me provide a reminder about the interrelationship between Energy Resources and NEP. As you know, the launch of NEP closed on July 1. Energy Resources will continue to consolidate NEP for accounting purposes, but beginning with this quarter, you will see a deduction for income representing NEP LP unitholders’ interests in NEP’s results. Energy Resources’ adjusted EPS increased by $0.07 per share year-over-year. The contribution from new wind and solar additions placed into service during or after the third quarter of 2013 was $0.09 per share and this continued growth in our contracted renewables business was the primary driver of Energy Resources’ growth. Our customer supply and trading business had a modest positive increase in contribution of $0.03 per share, driven mostly by favorable summer results in retail and wholesale full requirements. A mild summer is typically favorable for these parts of the portfolio. Wind resource came in at roughly 95% of the long-term average, which was roughly comparable to last year, and the existing asset portfolio added 1$0.01 per share overall. Offsetting these gains was a $0.03 per share decline in contribution from our gas infrastructure business, due to increased depreciation expense, primarily related to higher depletion rates. All other factors reduced results by $0.03 cents per share. For the full-year, we continue to expect to elect CITCs on roughly 265 megawatts for our Mountain View solar project and the portions of Genesis and Desert Sunlight solar projects that are expected to enter service in 2014. This equates to roughly $60 million in adjusted earnings, down from roughly $70 million in 2013 on 280 megawatts of solar projects. As I mentioned earlier, the team has driven significant growth in our portfolio of contracted renewables opportunities. Let me spend a bit of time now on where each program now stands. Our total 2013 to 2016 U.S. solar program is now roughly 1,400 megawatts. This includes roughly 304 megawatts newly added to the backlog since the last call, and is approximately 300 megawatts better than the high-end of our expectations at the time of the March 2013 Investor Conference. All of these new projects are expected to be in operation by the end of 2016. There are also a number of other projects that we continue to pursue, and we now believe that our total 2013 to 2016 U.S. solar program could be 1,600 to 1,800 megawatts. Turning to our wind programs, our U.S. development program for 2013 to 2015 is now nearly 1,900 megawatts. This includes 91 megawatts newly added to the backlog since the last call. Based on everything we see at the moment, we now believe our total 2013 to 2015 U.S. wind program, could exceed our previously stated range of up to 2,500 megawatts. In Canada, we added a new approximately 50 megawatt project to the backlog, which we expect to enter operations in 2016. Since the last call, we brought into service roughly 75 megawatts of solar, 199 megawatts of U.S. wind and 133 megawatts of Canadian wind, a total of over 400 megawatts. Not only are these very attractive assets in their own right, but we also believe that we have unlocked the potential to better highlight their value by isolating a portion of the portfolio and making the cash flows visible to investors through the creation of NEP. Let me now review the highlights for NEP. During the third quarter, NEP’s initial portfolio delivered cash available for distribution or CAFD of $27 million, which was in line with our expectations. Full financial results will be available when we file the 10-Q. The assets operated well and wind and solar resource were near normal. Overall, there is nothing at this time that causes us to change the expectations that we have previously shared for these assets for the 12-month period ending June 30, 2015. As I mentioned earlier, NEP has entered into agreements to expand its portfolio through two project acquisitions from NextEra Energy. The first of these is Palo Duro, an approximately 250 megawatt wind project in Texas that will sell 100% of its output under a 20-year PPA. It is expected to enter service in the fourth quarter of 2014. Palo Duro is not part of the ROFO portfolio. We expect to earn PTCs on the project and to enter into a differential partnership or tax equity structure that we expect will make the project very attractive to NEP investors. In essence, we expect our tax equity partners to make a portion of their contributions to the project through ongoing payments in exchange for receiving PTCs. We expect this to result in an overall project cash flow profile that fits the NEP model. The second acquisition is Shafter, a 20 megawatt solar project in California that will sell 100% of its output under a 20-year PPA. It is expected to enter service in the second quarter of ‘15 and is a part of the ROFO portfolio. NEP expects to acquire both projects in the first quarter of 2015 for total consideration of approximately $291 million, plus the assumption of approximately $250 million in tax equity financing, which is expected to close in December for Palo Duro, and subject to working capital adjustments. The $150 million of primary proceeds retained from the IPO will support a portion of the acquisition. The remaining consideration of roughly $141 million will be financed in the short-term through the utilization of NEP’s revolving credit facility, in addition to cash on hand at the time of the transactions. Since the revolver is not expected to be utilized for longer-term capital requirements, we expect to replace this interim financing with equity and potentially incremental project debt at some point in 2015. NEP expects the impact of these acquisitions to increase 2015 adjusted EBITDA and CAFD by roughly $60 million to $70 million and $15 million to $25 million respectively, and to increase the annual run rate of adjusted EBITDA and CAFD by roughly $65 million to $75 million and $20 million to $30 million respectively. We expect additional acquisition opportunities to become available as well, and I will talk more in a moment about our current thoughts on overall expected growth. Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the third quarter of 2014, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $660 million or $1.50 per share. NextEra Energy’s 2014 third quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $688 million and $1.55 respectively. Adjusted earnings from the corporate and other segment decreased $0.01 per share compared to the third quarter of 2013. The development of both Sabal Trail Transmission pipeline and Florida Southeast Connection pipeline continue to progress well through their respective processes. Florida Southeast Connection filed its FERC certificate application in September 2014, and Sabal Trail continues to refine the route with the expectation to file its FERC certificate application in November 2014. Both projects expect FERC authorization by year-end 2015 to support commercial operation by mid-2017. During the quarter, we completed the formation of our Mountain Valley Pipeline joint-venture with EQT Corporation. In addition, the joint-venture completed a binding open season for the roughly 300 mile natural gas pipeline designed to connect the Marcellus and Utica shales with markets in the Southeast region of the U.S., in order to support growing demand and improvements in reliability. After concluding the open season, the project has secured approximately 2 Bcf per day of 20-year firm capacity commitments. Based on our expected ownership share, the expected size of our capital opportunity is approximately $1.0 billion to $1.4 billion. Both companies have received Board approval to move ahead with the project. Looking ahead at NextEra Energy, we continue to expect full-year EPS to be in the range of $5.15 to $5.35 and this range includes the negative impact of about $0.15 associated with the launch of NEP that we discussed in the second quarter earnings release. Having completed a closer review of the 2015 outlook, we now see a range of $5.40 to $5.70 as being reasonable. We expect to see a few cents of drag associated with the combination of the accelerated transfer of assets to NEP, which I will discuss further in a moment, as well as higher capital spending associated with the more rapid evolution of the Energy Resources’ backlog. The accelerated transfers would give us more equity than we need to maintain our target credit metrics, other things being equal. And we can utilize this extra equity to support the additional CapEx without recourse to the equity markets. These effects are reflected in the $5.40 to $5.70 range. In the slides accompanying today’s presentation, we have also provided new disclosure for our expectations for the Energy Resources portfolio, focusing on our expectations for adjusted EBITDA and cash flow for 2015. Please note that this view of 2015 does not yet reflect the impact of the anticipated accelerated growth at NEP. For 2016, we are maintaining our current expectations of $5.50 to $6.00 for the moment, and we expect to be able to provide an update with the fourth quarter earnings release in January. As always, our expectations are subject to the usual caveats, including but not limited to, normal weather and operating conditions. Starting in 2016, we expect to see reflected in GAAP income the effects of asset transfers to NEP. Because of the subordination provisions governing NEE’s LP unit, gains on these transfers are currently deferred until one year after NEP pays distributions at a level of $1.13, corresponding to the high splits in the IDR structure. At that point, we expect to start amortizing any gains from sales of assets to NEP over the life of the assets. Looking beyond 2016, while we are not yet in a position to provide a specific numerical range for earnings, it is clear from the development of our capital deployment initiatives, that we are well positioned to sustain our strong growth profile. We expect to be able to sustain the 5% to 7% per year growth in EPS off a 2014 base, at least through 2018, assuming all our capital initiatives continue along their current path. In addition, everything we see suggests that our operating cash flow will continue to grow more rapidly than EPS during this period, and we expect average growth of operating cash flow in the 8% to 10% per year range through 2018. With the proposed acceleration in the growth of NEP, which I will detail in a moment, we should also see the IDR cash flow stream at NEE grow rapidly, so that by 2018 this could amount to somewhere between $75 million and $100 million per year. This is included in our overall expectations of cash flow growth. Turning now to NEP. We expect the initial portfolio to deliver roughly $270 million to $280 million of adjusted EBITDA in the first 12 months, yielding cash available for distribution or CAFD of nearly $85million to $95 million. For the full-year 2015, taking into account all the asset acquisitions we are now contemplating, we expect the NEP portfolio to generate adjusted EBITDA of $400 million to $440 million and CAFD of $100 million to $120 million. This would support a distribution level at an annualized rate of $1.125, which corresponds to the upper tier of the IDR splits by the end of 2015 or possibly slightly earlier. Again, the disclosure in the appendix does not yet reflect the impact of this acceleration of growth at NEP, since we have not yet determined the specific projects that will be made available to NEP. We expect to update our disclosure when a more specific plan is in place. After 2015, we currently see 12% to 15% per year growth in LP distributions, as being a reasonable range of expectations for at least the next five years. Let me now spend a moment explaining our logic for accelerating the short-term growth of NEP, and why we think it will be good both for NEP LP unitholders, and for NextEra shareholders. We have spent the last few weeks examining in more detail different scenarios for NEP acquisitions of Energy Resources’ projects. We’ve also spent considerable time asking questions of our investors and considering their input. While we retain accountability for our decisions, we recognize that many investors have been thinking about the same issues and we value the input we have received. We recognize that, other things equal, if there is value to be created by transferring an asset to NEP, in general, it will be better to do so earlier rather than later, subject to the project being sufficiently far along in development and construction to fit the NEP competitive model. At the same time, NEP’s competitive positioning is strongly supported by the long runway of growth that it can reasonably expect to offer investors, given the large portfolio of Energy Resources projects that it can hope to acquire. As we have studied in the portfolio more closely and considered how it may evolve, we have come to the conclusion that we can support a short-term acceleration of growth, while still preserving reasonable expectations of growth in the 12% to 15% per year range for several years thereafter. We think this profile is more attractive to NEP investors than simply continuing the 12% to 15% growth rate and maintaining more assets in the Energy Resources portfolio for a longer period of time. Two factors in particular have changed, since we launched NEP. First, as we’ve discussed, we’ve been working on a tax equity structure that we now think will enable us to make some projects available to NEP, earlier than we had previously expected. And of course, the Palo Duro project discussed earlier is an example of this. Second, again as discussed earlier, the development pipeline and backlog at Energy Resources have continued to evolve in a very positive fashion over the last few months, and nothing has changed our view that the longer term prospects for renewables development in the U.S., particularly with the prospect of EPA regulation of carbon dioxide emissions are very favorable. These factors in our judgment support an acceleration of NEP growth. From an NEP LP unitholder’s perspective, there are two other secondary factors that also support this proposed shift. First, investors have noted that NEP currently offers limited liquidity simply because of its size, and accelerating the growth in the short-term should improve liquidity. And, second, although the initial portfolio is broad and diverse, accelerating the growth will enable the portfolio to become broader and more diversified, which again should be a positive for NEP investors. Finally from a NextEra Energy shareholder perspective, accelerating the growth of NEP will also mean that the upper tier of the IDR splits will be reached more rapidly than we had originally thought. While this doesn’t change the fundamental value proposition, we think it will serve to highlight a portion of the NEE value proposition, which perhaps today is not widely recognized among NEE investors. We estimate that the IDR cash flow stream could be worth $5 to $10 per share later in the decade. For all these reasons, we have concluded that accelerating the growth of NEP over the next twelve months or so, while still retaining reasonable expectations of sustained growth in the 12% 15% per year range for several years thereafter, makes sense for both sets of investors. At this point, we are not prepared to discuss the specific assets that NEP expects to acquire, as we are still working through the details. However, this accelerated growth profile is still likely to be dominated by the same kinds of high-quality, long-term contracted renewables projects that characterize the initial portfolio. Longer term it may well make sense to broaden the NEP portfolio into new asset classes, but for the short-term, we believe continuing to focus primarily on renewables projects makes sense. To sum up, both NEE and NEP had excellent quarters. Current performance is strong, the outlook at least through 2016 is highly visible, and we continue to believe that we have some of the best long-term growth prospects in our industry. All this is supported by a very strong financial position, which we expect to maintain. Our fundamentals are excellent and our growth initiatives continue to evolve in a very positive fashion. With that, we will now open the line for questions. Since this is a combined conference call for NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners, it will be helpful if you can be clear which entity you are referring to in your questions. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And we’ll take our first question from Stephen Byrd from Morgan Stanley.
Stephen Byrd – Morgan Stanley: Good morning.
Moray Dewhurst: Good morning, Steve.
Stephen Byrd – Morgan Stanley: Moray, I wanted to explore the PTC structure that you outlined, that could permit perhaps more assets to be dropped down to NEP earlier than we had expected. Can you generally speak to that – you mentioned some of the assets could be eligible. Is this something we should be thinking as fairly broadly eligible for your assets with PTCs or is it a more limited field of assets? Just trying to, sort of, generally get a feel for how significant this structure is.
Moray Dewhurst: Sure. I guess the first point to be made is it applies to new projects going forward, so anything that’s already in the portfolio either has a structure against it or probably is very far along in its 10-year window of eligibility and it wouldn’t make sense for us to go back to some of those, but potentially for all PTC projects going forward, subject to available market capacity, this could be applicable. Now when I say available market capacity, the tax equity market is a relatively specialized part of the overall capital excess possibilities that we have available to us. And the capacity of that can vary from year-to-year. So depending upon just how much capacity there is, we determine really how much we can do in any particular year, but I think it could be quite broadly applicable going forward.
Stephen Byrd – Morgan Stanley: That’s helpful. And then, just looking at the wind business, obviously you’ve had some great progress in terms of additional contracts, and it looks like the outlook is positive for additional contracts. Could you speak broadly to which parts – within the U.S., which part of the U.S., which regions look most attractive in terms of growth, is it more the upper Midwest, more Texas or which parts of the country are you and your colleagues seeing the most opportunities in?
Moray Dewhurst: Sure. I would ask Armando to offer a few more – a little more color, but broadly speaking our development efforts have been and will continue to be concentrated on the best wind resource areas because that drives the best economics, and that tends to be all up and down in the middle part of the country, but Amanda can speak more specifically to some of the areas we’re focused on.
Armando Pimentel: Sure. I think it’s – number one, it’s the middle part of the country. I call it the Midwest, but I’m not a geography teacher when I talk about the Midwest, it’s a very broad section, starting up in the Dakotas, going all the way down to the Texas region, including a little bit of Colorado, but I would include the Northeast in that. So it’s a wide area. We’ve developed very well in the area in the past and we continue to do well. I think what you’ll see as some of the newer projects come forward that we do have now some projects actually out in California, some wind projects that are starting to make sense. And we continue to look at the Canadian development for new projects. And just this past quarter, we’re able to sign another 50 megawatt PPA.
Moray Dewhurst: Yes, Stephen just to add on. We have traditionally not focused a great deal of effort on the Northeast and the East Coast and that continues to be the case. The development challenges are greater, our projects tend to be smaller and the wind resource tends to be weaker. So the overall economics get much more challenging. So we tend to go where the economics are most favorable.
Stephen Byrd – Morgan Stanley: Great. Thank you very much.
Moray Dewhurst: Thank you.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.
Dan Eggers – Credit Suisse: Hi. Good morning, guys.
Moray Dewhurst: Good morning, Dan.
Dan Eggers – Credit Suisse: It’s very good job with the pipeline additions on the renewable side at NEER. Can you maybe talk a little more, A, on the wind side, if you’re going to qualify for the PTCs, or if you need an extension on PTCs to hit the upper end of the new guidance range? And then, on the solar additions, kind of, what markets you’re seeing better opportunity, or you’re even to add more significant backlog?
Moray Dewhurst: Sure. Again, I’ll ask Armando to comment.
Armando Pimentel: All right. Good morning, Dan. Everything that we announced today on the wind side and including the potential to go over the high-end of the range would be built in 2015 or by the end of 2015. And we feel very comfortable that they would all qualify for the production tax credits. Interestingly enough, I’d say over the last two to three months, we’ve started to get into discussions with some customers that are looking for 2016 wind. Now obviously those contracts, if we sign them with those customers, would be PTC contingent, but everything that we talked about today would be built by the end of 2015 and would qualify for the PTC. In terms of solar, I’d say it’s just about everywhere. We’re seeing good activity all the way from the south, and from the south, I would mean anywhere from Texas, all the way really to the Southeast United States, but we’re also seeing interest really because of the improvement in economics that the reduction in the panel prices, the reduction in the balance of plant, we’re seeing interest all the way up to the Canadian border, which is a positive. The contracts that we announced today, we announced I think roughly 304 megawatts of new projects. Those projects span from California, all the way to the Southeast United States.
Dan Eggers – Credit Suisse: Okay, very good. And then, Moray, on the 375 megawatts projects at the utility. Can you remind us, how those will go into rates, or how you guys will get recovery on those in the midst of the four year deal you have in place?
Moray Dewhurst: We would not be looking for any adjustment to the rate agreement. So we will live with the base rates that we have in place.
Dan Eggers – Credit Suisse: Okay, very good. Thank you, guys.
Moray Dewhurst: Thank you.
Operator: Next we’ll take our question from Steven Fleishman – Wolfe Research.
Steven Fleishman – Wolfe Research: Hi Moray, how are you?
Moray Dewhurst: Good morning Steve.
Steven Fleishman – Wolfe Research: Just the first question and I’m not sure if you can answer this now, but you mentioned the 5% to 7% long-term earnings growth but 8% to 10% long-term cash flow growth. Could you maybe give us some sense or if Jim’s there, when you’re thinking about dividend policy, are you going to focus more on earnings growth or cash flow growth?
Moray Dewhurst: If you recall how we got to – the logic that got us to the current target 55% payout ratio, it was fundamentally based on a shift in portfolio mix. So with the portfolio shifting to a higher concentration of regulated and long-term contracted assets, we felt that that supported and justified slightly higher payout ratio than we have had in the past. If you carry that logic forward, while the same trend continues from 2014 on, it’s sort of really at a slower pace. So at this point, I don’t see a particular logic for recommending a change in that payout ratio with one possible exception, which I’ll come back to in a minute, but assuming that we go on that obviously means, dividend growth roughly in line with EPS growth. The exception that I have noted on a couple of occasions is, should we at some point in the future get to a position where our capital deployment opportunity set starts to slow down, then the rapid growth in the cash flows would quickly move us into a free cash flow positive position. And if you saw that being a sustained phenomenon for multiple years, then in that circumstance, I think we would be inclined to recommend an increase in the payout ratio. So I think those are kind of the two broad policy things that keep in mind. Obviously, we are always sensitive to the overall dividend position and how it compares with other companies we are competing for capital against, so we will always be taking that into account but from a policy perspective those were the two points I will make.
Steven Fleishman – Wolfe Research: Okay. And then I guess, a question, maybe this is for Jim, just historically while you’ve talked about the 5% to 7% growth, and Jim has said it several times, he would be disappointed if he didn’t hit the upper end of that, is that still the view? And just with all these kind of different moving parts, it seems like you’re executing really well on the growth investment. Is that going to show up into what kind of you’ve said on getting to the higher end?
Jim Robo: Yes, Steve. I will continue to say that I’ll be disappointed if we don’t in ‘16 earned at the top end of the range at $6, and we’ll be giving an update on that ‘16 guidance in January, as Moray said earlier on the call.
Steven Fleishman – Wolfe Research: Okay. One last quick thing on the Florida solar, and you might have answered this, but how would those projects work, would you just do them and sell the utility under just the current rates, or would you look for like the solar clause [ph] or something of that sort?
Moray Dewhurst: No. It would be recovered within the current base rates. Obviously we want to make sure that they are those cost effective solution for our customers, we’re pretty close on that. We think that we can demonstrate that’s the case, because these are kind of specific projects where we’ve already done a lot of work and they happen to be in a particular locations work from a transmission perspective. So if we can do that, we would expect to go ahead and construct them and demonstrate that, net-net they are a good deal for customers from a total build perspective, in which case, they should roll into base rates going forward.
Steven Fleishman – Wolfe Research: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith – UBS: Hi, good morning.
Moray Dewhurst: Good morning, Julien.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith – UBS: So just following up on the latest NEP GP guidance. The $200 million that was depicted for the end of the decade, is that consistent with the 12% to 15%, and to the extent to which it is, can you give us a sense for dropdown assumptions etcetera, that would be baked in?
Moray Dewhurst: Julien, I’m not quite sure I followed the question. Today, we talked about $75 million to $100 million around the 2018 time. If you carry the growth forward a couple of more years, yes, I think you can reasonably see getting to the $200 million a year level. I believe that was the number that I mentioned in speech I gave at Platts the other day. So it’s really just an extension of the growth profile. As I said in the prepared remarks, we are right now really working through one of the specific asset that it makes most sense to make available to NEP for the short-term acceleration, but the longer-term growth profile and expectations are continue to be supported by all the projects in the Energy Resources’ portfolio that we talked about in the past, including potentially contracted fossil assets and including potentially pipeline projects.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith – UBS: In order to be more specific, what about the dropdown multiples that you’re thinking about broadly, is it still kind of in that 9% to 11% range?
Moray Dewhurst: As a broad generalization, yes. Although one of the things that I’ve observed as we’ve gone through these first transactions is that EBITDA multiple and not necessarily a very good metric for thinking about dropdown valuation, because the profile of the projects can be quite different and it depends if you have a project where you have, CITC for example, whether it’s pre or post the tax effect. But we haven’t really changed our view of the long-term valuation, which as I said on several occasions is going to depend upon the individual project first and foremost.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith – UBS: Got you. And then secondly, you’ve talked about disproportionate cash flow growth. Obviously some discussions are laid around large utility acquisitions. What are you thinking about use of cash flow structurally, is the business orienting towards more resources-like businesses, or are we talking about more utility growth in the future, be it outside of FPL or within it etcetera?
Moray Dewhurst: Well, as this actually implicit in the part of my answer to Steve’s question earlier, both sides of the house continue to have very strong growth prospects. And so as we go forward, the balance is remaining roughly equal. We still continue to become a little bit more regulated and long-term contracted, but not greatly so over the next few years. And so we will continue to pursue the opportunities that we see in the existing portfolio as much as we can. In terms of third-party acquisitions or corporate large deal acquisitions, as we’ve said before, we are in principal open to the possibility. We don’t need to do a big deal. We continue to be very successful. We’re going to be very disciplined if we do look at anything, but it’s not fundamental to our strategy.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith – UBS: Got you. And then just a quick clarification to Dan’s last question on the solar PV side, while you might not be filing for it in the immediate sense, once you are through the current stay out, those would indeed roll into base rates?
Moray Dewhurst: Sure, I would. Assuming that they indeed act to reduce total customer builds over the long-term then they would roll in the rate base and they’d be reflected in our filings in 2016 assuming we file as we expect to in 2016 and for what revenue rates would go into effect in 2017.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith – UBS: Great. Excellent, thank you
Moray Dewhurst: Thank you.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Shar Pourreza with Citigroup.
Shar Pourreza – Citigroup: Good morning everyone.
Moray Dewhurst: Good morning.
Shar Pourreza – Citigroup: Just on the solar in Florida. When you mentioned it’s the most cost-effective solution for the rate payers, are you referring to the projects being at retail rate parity, or are we talking more an LCOE reaching like a natural gas high heat rate peaking asset. So can you just maybe comment on what you mean by cost-effective?
Moray Dewhurst: Sure. The way to think about cost-effective is for these projects is to think of them in the context of a constantly evolving integrated resource plan. So solar in Florida obviously has energy value, it also has capacity value based on its coincidence or degree of coincidence with the load curve. So essentially what we do is in the IRP, we plug in different combinations or potential future generation and figure out on a present value basis, which of those are cheaper for our customers. And so if we can get to the stage where, as we think we now can with these three specific projects, we can introduce them into the mix and have the overall present value as seen through the customers eyes lower. That’s a good thing for our customers and something that we want to go ahead with.
Shar Pourreza – Citigroup: Got you. And then, with the latest solar projects you’ve added to your pipeline, and then maybe comments that the solar to become very economical at the end of the decade. Can you just maybe talk about the current LCOE trend versus a higher heat rate peaking asset, or are you – with and without the investment tax credit?
Moray Dewhurst: I can try, but it’s very hard to think about LCOE, because you really need to think, as I’ve just described for the FPL situation, in how these assets work into an integrated system. So you’re really not, or you shouldn’t compare assets side-by-side. That would maybe be appropriate if you were thinking about building new system from scratch, but in our case we’re talking about introducing new capacity into an existing system. With that as a caveat however, I would say that we are getting to the stage where potentially by the end of the decade, assuming that we revert to the 10% ITC that’s embedded part of the tax code, that in many regions of the southern part of the country, we could see something that is competitive on an energy basis with combined cycle unit. Whether or not that makes it fully competitive on an integrated basis, then depends upon capacity value and shape of the load curve and a whole variety of other things in the region that we’re talking about
Shar Pourreza – Citigroup: Got you. That’s very helpful actually. And then just lastly, on the rate basing of the E&P reserves. Is there any potential in how large this could be relative to what FPL’s gas needs are?
Moray Dewhurst: I think for the next few years, we’re going to be limited more by sort of the pragmatic factors than theoretical long-term potential. So in theory, if we could get to 30%, 40%, 50% of the gas burn, I think that would be a very attractive proposition from a customer perspective, but I think it’s going to take us time to get there. I think first of all, we’ve got to get the initial deal approved and up and running and show that, that works as we anticipate it will. And then, I think we want to build on that at a moderate pace, and demonstrate that the overall strategy is effective. I think the other factor that could be limiting here is simply the available opportunity set. FPL is looking for something a little bit different in gas reserves than where the general market is, and by that, I mean FPL is really obviously focused on dry gas. And a lot of the places that are being pursued out there tend towards the wetter or oilier spectrum. So there may be some limitations just driven by the availability of sets. So all of that is in my mind says that I think we have realistic odds of scaling the thing up to the point where within the next few years, we can commit several hundred million dollars of capital each year into it, beyond that, it’s too far for us to look right now.
Shar Pourreza – Citigroup: Terrific. Thank you very much.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Greg Gordon with ISI Group.
Greg Gordon – ISI Group: Thanks. Good morning.
Moray Dewhurst: Good morning, Greg.
Greg Gordon – ISI Group: So, sorry to beat a dead horse on the regulated utility side, but just following up on the solar question. Presumably, you’re making headroom in under current base rates through the continued improvement in costs under Project Momentum, such that you would still expect to be able to earn inside the ROE range, until you roll these into base rates?
Moray Dewhurst: Yes, that’s generally true, not just at these assets, but more generally infrastructure CapEx that needs to be recovered under the current – in terms of the current base rate agreement. Our ability to invest, for example, in our reliability initiatives is conditional upon our ability to manage the O&M effectively. So the fact that we’ve been very effective there, and as I said in the prepared remarks, ahead of where we expected to be in the sense creates more headroom to allow us to deploy capital. Now that capital still needs to be productive from a customers’ viewpoint, either increasing reliability or as we just discussed with respect to the solar units, improving the long-term cost-effectiveness of the system, but assuming it is, then from an investor perspective, we can sort of afford to accommodate it within the terms of the current settlement agreement.
Greg Gordon – ISI Group: Great. Two more questions, one on accounting. You mentioned that the accounting treatment for dropdowns would be to amortize those gains starting 12 months after the initial drop, and over the life of the – over what’s the time again, I’m sorry, I don’t recall the last piece.
Moray Dewhurst: Yes, let me just repeat that. In the structuring of NEP, because of the presence of IDRs, we have subordinated our LP interest. Those subordination provisions go away one year after we have sustained the high – the LP distribution corresponding to the high level of the splits. Until that time, from an accounting perspective, we defer all the accounting gains that are recorded on the transfer of assets from energy resources to NEP. So once we clear that one year period, then we can start amortizing those gains.
Greg Gordon – ISI Group: And those gains would be amortized over what period?
Moray Dewhurst: Over the life of the assets.
Greg Gordon – ISI Group: Okay. And we would expect those to run through NextEra Energy Resources’ ongoing earnings?
Moray Dewhurst: Correct.
Greg Gordon – ISI Group: Right. And so you get the cash in, and you’re doing the drop. You amortize the gain over starting the year out over the life of the asset?
Moray Dewhurst: We are subject to the – well, the technical description that I gave, going forward, it would then be the case, but then for subsequent projects, you would be getting the cash and starting to realize the gain simultaneously.
Greg Gordon – ISI Group: Got you. Great. One final question for Armando. We talked a bit last time we saw you about the opportunity for storage as a growth investment at NEER, California has this RFP going on. Can you talk about whether or not storage is in fact, a piece of the growth opportunity at NEER, and if so, what is the magnitude and when might we start seeing those investments?
Armando Pimentel: I think it is. I think I’ve been pretty consistent in saying that at least my expectations for storage investments to become a significant part of our CapEx spending at NEER is really towards the later part of the decade. I mean there are – as you mentioned there are opportunities in California, opportunities in Hawaii, opportunities in New York, and actually there are some smaller opportunities in PJM. We are looking at and playing in all of those markets, but I would not expect in the near-term through 2016, even if we’re significantly successful for the CapEx to be very meaningful in terms of what it adds to earnings. Having said that, the team that we have put together, I think is a good team, and I continue to believe that towards the later part of this decade, we will be able to make some significant investments.
Greg Gordon – ISI Group: Thank you, gentlemen.
Moray Dewhurst: I think we have time for one more.
Operator: We’ll take our question from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.
Paul Patterson – Glenrock Associates: Good morning.
Moray Dewhurst: Good morning, Paul.
Paul Patterson – Glenrock Associates: Just to recap a little bit here on the NEP accelerated growth and maintaining the long-term growth outlook as well. Is that basically being driven by just a more robust outlook in terms of the opportunities for renewable development or – I just wanted to clarify as to what – just making sure that I understand exactly how you’re able to accelerate the growth in the near-term, and maintain long-term growth. Is that what’s driving it?
Moray Dewhurst: Yes, I mean the underpinning of it obviously are long-term expectations for the evolution of the Energy Resources’ portfolio because that’s the principal source of the projects that create the opportunity set for NextEra Energy Partners. So we’re feeling very good about that. We’ve had great success this quarter in the relatively short-term or the long-term fundamentals that clearly for us to be very encouraging. So that’s kind of a fundamental driver. Then assuming that you can get comfortable with a long-term growth expectation for the opportunities set, then the next question is, what’s the right sort of shape to the growth profile, and clearly we’ve recognized that, other things equal, meaning as long as you can sustain a long period of good growth, by good I mean 12% to 15%, then it’s better to have more earlier rather than later. And then if you couple that with recognition that with this tax equity structure, we may have some assets that previously we would have thought about as not being available for 10 years, now being eligible earlier. It makes sense to get those transferred when we can. So there is more opportunity, particularly in the short-term, and hence acceleration in the short-term at least was to make a lot of sense.
Paul Patterson – Glenrock Associates: Okay. I just want to make sure I understood that. Then with respect to Slide 20, and the new investment – now I realize things have changed. You have changed things a little bit here. Provide a lot more information, but it does look like the new investment line has dropped a bit, obviously we have NEP on the top part there. Is there anything that’s – I mean, could you elaborate a little bit more about what’s changed in new investment, other than the allocation to NEP in that slide?
Moray Dewhurst: It’s going to be difficult for me to do that on the call.
Paul Patterson – Glenrock Associates: Okay.
Moray Dewhurst: Let me just couple of caveat. That Slide 20, it does have some differences from the part, what I call gross margin hedged chart. So it’s very difficult to compare those directly. Among other things, we have in the new disclosure, we have allocated into the adjusted EBITDA across the various lines the G&A that we have supporting that respective elements that the business that we didn’t have before. So all those were intended to be a little bit lower. One of the things that is on our list to do, is now to go back and compare these pieces and understand precisely why is some of the line items might look a little bit different. I would say there is no major change to the 2015 numbers. Most of the developments that we’ve seen in the last quarter will tend to affect ‘16 and ‘17 much more.
Paul Patterson – Glenrock Associates: Okay, great. And then just finally, weather versus normal. I’m sorry if I missed this. What has it been year-to-date, the impact of weather versus normal?
Moray Dewhurst: On Energy Resources year-to-date on the wind side is a little above leverage, the quarter was a little bit below average. Solar has been about on.
Paul Patterson – Glenrock Associates: And the utility? Has it been big at all [ph]?
Moray Dewhurst: No, it’s been in average year overall. The challenges we’ve had here in Florida have been associated much more with heavy rainfall and thunderstorms and lightening, but in terms of average cooling degree days, it’s not been greatly different. Now recognize of course, that all of that gets absorbed by pluses or minuses and simple as depreciation and amortization at FPL. So it doesn’t have a direct immediate ROE impact.
Paul Patterson – Glenrock Associates: Right. Okay. Thanks so much.
Moray Dewhurst: Okay. Well, thank you very much.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners' 2014 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Amanda Finnis. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Amanda Finnis: Thank you, Chanel. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the second quarter 2014 combined earnings conference call for NextEra Energy and for NextEra Energy Partners. With me this morning are Jim Robo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; Moray Dewhurst, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; Armando Pimentel, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources, all of whom are also officers of NextEra Energy Partners; as well as Eric Silagy, President and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light Company. Moray will provide an overview of our results and our executive team will then be available to answer your questions. We will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release, in the comments made during this conference call, in the Risk Factor section of the accompanying presentation or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found on our websites, www.nexteraenergy.com and www.nexteraenergypartners.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. Today's presentation also includes references to adjusted earnings, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of the non-GAAP measure to the closest GAAP financial measure. With that, I will turn the call over to Moray.
Moray P. Dewhurst: Thank you, Amanda. Good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy had an excellent quarter, capped off by the successful launch of NextEra Energy Partners. All parts of the NextEra portfolio performed well, and both NEE and NEP remain on track to deliver the financial expectations, including cash flow and credit metrics, that we have previously disclosed. I will provide more detail on expectations later in the call. At Florida Power & Light, we have invested roughly $1.6 billion of capital year-to-date, consistent with our strategy of improving the long-term value we offer our customers. Our major capital projects remain on track, and we continue to expect the last of our 3 generation modernization projects at Port Everglades to come online in mid-2016. Our reliability and storm hardening initiatives are also progressing well. In addition to these efforts to improve our electric delivery system, we are now exploring opportunities to help us deliver lower and more stable natural gas costs for our customers. Last month, FPL announced an innovative plan to invest in long-term natural gas supplies, which I will talk about more in a moment. And we were particularly pleased to learn that FPL was named the most trusted utility in the nation based on a large nationwide sample of utility customers. At Energy Resources, our development and construction programs remain on track, and our backlog of contracted renewables projects continues to development, with a PPA for another roughly 100 megawatts of U.S. wind signed since the last call. Earnings growth was driven by new contracted renewals projects, as well as strong results in our customer supply and trading business. At NextEra Energy Partners, the assets operated well and delivered financial results in line with expectations. In addition, just after the close of the quarter, the last of the projects in the initial portfolio became operational. Now let's look at the results for FPL. For the second quarter of 2014, FPL reported net income of $423 million or $0.96 per share, up $0.04 per share year-over-year. The principal drivers of FPL's earnings growth in the quarter were continued investment in the business and an increase in wholesale operations. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $570 million in the quarter, and we expect our full year capital investments to be roughly $3.2 billion. Regulatory capital employed grew 6.2% over the same quarter last year, and net income grew 8.2%. Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes for the 12 months ended June 2014 will be approximately 11.3%. Similar to last quarter, this includes the impact of transition costs associated with our enterprise-wide productivity initiative, Project Momentum, that we incurred over the 12-month period, all of which were incurred in 2013. Absent these costs, regulatory ROE would have been 11.5%, which remains our target for the full year 2014. As a reminder, the impact of the 2013 transition costs will roll off our reported regulatory ROE as we move through the year, since the regulatory ROE is measured on a 12-month trailing basis. We utilized $6 million of reserve amortization during the quarter in order to achieve this predetermined ROE, bringing our year-to-date utilization reserve amortization to $131 million. Under the current rate agreement, we record reserve amortization entries to achieve a predetermined regulatory ROE for each 12-month trailing period, in this case, the 11.5% that I previously mentioned, excluding special charges such as the Project Momentum transition costs. As we've mentioned before, we always expect to use more reserve amortization in the first half of the year than the second half, given the pattern of our underlying revenues and expenses. Over the remainder of the year, assuming normal weather and operating conditions, we expect to reverse the reserve amortization taken in the first half of the year and end the year with a balance roughly equal to where we started or possibly even a little better. Looking beyond 2014, we continue to believe that our reserve balance, when combined with our weather-normalized sales growth forecast of 1.5% to 2% per year and our current O&M expectations, as well as the commitment of a total of roughly $7 billion in infrastructure CapEx for the period 2013 to 2016, will allow us to support regulatory ROEs in the upper half of the allowed band of 9.5% to 11.5% for the remaining period of the current rate agreement. We expect that we can do so in ways that will further improve our already outstanding customer value proposition and will position us well for 2017 and beyond. In Florida, most economic indicators we follow continue to show improvement year-over-year, while some appear to have recently stabilized. Most notably, Florida's focus on economic development and an overall improvement in the business climate continue to encourage business expansion and additional hiring, while measures of confidence in the state of the economy have generally improved. As a result, Florida labor force participation rate has increased in recent months, even while the U.S. rate continues to drift downward. Clearly, the return of previously discouraged workers into the labor force is positive, although it will naturally mean that further reductions in Florida's unemployment rate will come at a slower rate. Florida's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in June was 6.2%, down 1.2 percentage points from a year ago. The number of jobs in Florida was up 237,500, an increase of 3.1% compared to a year earlier, and June was the 47th consecutive month with positive job growth in Florida, following more than 3 years of job losses. Nationally, the number of jobs was up 1.8% over the year. Florida's annual job growth rate has exceeded the nation's rate since April 2012. Florida's private sector continues to drive the state's job growth, and more than 620,000 private sector jobs have been added since December 2010. Turning to the Florida housing market. Recent data appear to show indicators settling into a steadier and hopefully more sustainable pace. As the accompanying chart shows, new building permits have stabilized and remain at comparatively healthy levels as Florida ranked second-highest in the U.S. in new housing permits. Mortgage delinquency rates continue to decline, and the Case-Shiller Index for South Florida shows home prices up 14.6% from the prior year. Other positive economic data across the state include continued improvement in retail taxable sales, as well as the consumer confidence index. Overall, Florida's economy continues to progress well. Our customer and usage metrics at FPL this quarter show mixed results. We saw the largest average increase of customers since the second quarter of 2007, with approximately 91,000 more customers than in the comparable quarter of 2013 representing growth of 2%. Roughly half of the increase can be attributed to the rollout of our remote connect and disconnect capability, enabled by our smart meter program that we highlighted last year. As a reminder, these new customers, which are disproportionately low usage and residential, have a lower impact on our sales. Taking this into account, we estimate that customer growth accounted for about 1% of the increase in sales during the quarter. Overall usage grew by 0.6%, driven by favorable weather comparison. Underlying usage per customer, however, decreased 1.3% compared to the same quarter last year. As you may recall, usage was in line with our long-term expectations during the first quarter, and as we have often pointed out, this metric can be somewhat volatile on a quarterly basis. Our long-term expectation of underlying usage growth continues to be approximately 0.5% per year, net of the impact of efficiency and conservation programs, at least through the period of the rate agreement. The 12-month average of low-usage customers fell to 8.1%, its lowest level in 7 years, while the average number of inactive accounts for the quarter declined to levels not seen since early 2004. As I mentioned earlier, FPL has announced a plan to invest in long-term natural gas supplies and has filed a petition with the Florida Public Service Commission seeking approval. As a first step in the plan, FPL will partner with PetroQuest Energy to develop natural gas production wells in the Woodford Shale region in southeastern Oklahoma. While a proposed initial program of up to roughly $200 million of capital investment is modest in size relative to FPL's overall natural gas needs, we view the transaction as an important first step in what we hope will be a larger program that will improve the value we deliver to our customers even further. Acquiring an interest in natural gas reserves is expected to lower long-term fuel costs and provide a long-term hedge against potential volatility in the market price for natural gas, which is a large component of the price of electricity, and would thereby address a concern that a number of policymakers have raised. In addition to the initial proposal, FPL has also requested that the PSC approve a set of guidelines for subsequent natural gas production projects to allow the company, and in turn its customers, to take advantage of future beneficial natural gas investment opportunities. FPL expects a PSC decision by the end of 2014 or early 2015. Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported second quarter 2014 GAAP earnings of $81 million or $0.18 per share. Adjusted earnings for the second quarter were $213 million or $0.48 per share. These adjusted results include 2 unusual items, both associated with the launch of NextEra Energy Partners: first, a negative impact of $0.05 per share from restructuring and direct transaction costs associated with the creation of NEP; second, a negative impact of $0.10 per share, which represents an income tax charge driven by separating our Canadian projects to enable them to fit into the overall NEP structure. This is a noncash item, and any real cash tax impact -- if there were to be any -- would occur many years in the future. In fact, there may never be any cash impact as we believe this item may be reversed in future periods pending discussions with Canadian tax authorities. Together, these 2 items reduced Energy Resources' adjusted results by about $0.15 per share. So the underlying operating results were very strong and, in fact, exceeded our expectations with excellent performance in virtually all parts of the portfolio. As you know, the launch of NEP came at the end of the quarter and NEP was not operational in the second quarter. As a result, Energy Resources' second quarter results do not reflect any deduction for noncontrolling interest. Going forward, Energy Resources will continue to consolidate NEP for accounting purposes, and you should expect to see a deduction from income representing the NEP LP unitholders' interest in Energy Resources results. Our investor relations team will be ready to address any questions you may have about the interrelationships between Energy Resources and NEP. Energy Resources' contribution to adjusted EPS decreased by $0.08 year-over-year. Setting aside the combined negative impact of $0.15 per share from the unusual items associated with establishing and launching NEP that I discussed earlier, the core business delivered great results. Strong contributions from growth in our contracted renewables portfolio added $0.05 per share, reflecting new wind and solar investments placed into service during or after the second quarter of 2013. Consistent with our commitment to recycling capital, asset sales collectively added $0.06 per share, including $0.03 per share due to a gain on a sale of wells in our gas infrastructure business. We expect to continue to recycle capital from time to time within the gas infrastructure business, keeping our overall commitment of capital to this business to a small fraction of the total. The customer supply and trading business added $0.07 per share, primarily reflecting structured transactions tailored to meet specific customer needs. The contributions from existing assets declined by $0.05 per share, driven primarily by the planned refueling outage at Seabrook. However, this was better than we had anticipated as Seabrook's outage was the best ever for the facility at just over 23 days. In addition, wind resource, overall, was strong during the quarter, although the year-over-year impact was small, as the second quarter of 2013 was also well above average. All other factors reduced results by $0.06 per share, including $0.02 of higher interest expense associated with the growing portfolio and $0.02 of dilution. For the full year, we continue to expect to elect CITCs on roughly 265 megawatts for our Mountain View Solar project and the portions of Genesis and Desert Sunlight solar projects that are expected to enter service in 2014. This equates to roughly $60 million in adjusted earnings, down from roughly $70 million in 2013 on 280 megawatts of solar projects. Let me now turn to NEP. As I just noted, NEP was not operational during the second quarter, and therefore, while it has released results and will file a Form 10-Q, the presentation of results follows what is known as predecessor format, which is the same basis as was presented in the S-1. I must caution you that this is likely to be different from what you will see going forward, in particular, because the tax treatment of the NEP assets will be different under the NEP structure. As a consequence, analysis of NEP second quarter reported results is not particularly meaningful. Moreover, we recognize that most NEP investors will be focused on EBITDA and cash available for distribution, and we expect to provide analysis of these variables for the third quarter and beyond. During the second quarter, the NEP assets performed in line with our expectations. Consequently, the EBITDA and cash flow of the portfolio were also consistent with our expectations. The second unit at our Genesis project entered commercial operations late in the first quarter and operated well throughout the second quarter, while the last of the initial portfolio assets, our Bluewater wind project in Ontario, started commercial operations just after the end of the quarter. Overall, we were very pleased with the performance of the NEP portfolio during the second quarter. Shifting back to the broader Energy Resources portfolio, the team continues to execute on our backlog and pursue additional contracted renewable development opportunities. In Canada, we continue to expect the remaining approximately 400 megawatts of wind in our backlog to enter service by the end of 2015, with the majority expected to come into service by the end of this year. Our solar backlog remains on track and during the quarter we brought 13 megawatts of solar into service with the partial commissioning of Desert Sunlight. We continue to expect to bring the remaining roughly 635 megawatts of our backlog into service by the end of 2016. In addition to our existing contracted backlog, we continue to pursue additional solar opportunities that could come online by the end of 2016. Turning to our U.S. wind program. The team recently signed a PPA for a roughly 100-megawatt project, which is expected to come into service in 2015, bringing our total contracted U.S. wind development program for 2013 through 2015 to approximately 1,770 megawatts. Based on everything we see at the moment, we continue to believe our total 2013 to 2015 U.S. wind program could be 2,000 to 2,500 megawatts. In the appendix of our earnings presentation, we have provided a reconciliation of all anticipated megawatts at Energy Resources through the end of 2016, which may be helpful to NEP investors as well. Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the second quarter of 2014, NextEra Energy's GAAP net income was $492 million or $1.12 per share. NextEra Energy's 2014 second quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS was $630 million and $1.43, respectively. Adjusted earnings from the Corporate & Other segment increased $0.01 per share compared to the second quarter of 2013. You may recall that when discussing the possible creation of NEP, we indicated that an important factor in our decision-making would be the impact it might have on credit. We are pleased to note that S&P, Moody's and Fitch all affirmed our ratings and stable outlook. Looking forward, as NEP grows, we will continue to focus on ensuring that we sustain our strong credit position, both in terms of our credit metrics, as well as in our focus on portfolio mix and business composition. The development of both Sabal Trail Transmission and Florida Southeast Connection continue to progress well through their respective processes, and we continue to expect to submit necessary filings with FERC later this year. During the quarter, we also announced a nonbinding open season for a 330-mile natural gas pipeline project called Mountain Valley Pipeline, partnering with EQT Corporation. The project is designed to connect the Marcellus and Utica Shales with markets in the southeast region of the U.S. in order to support growing demand and improvements in reliability. The results of the open season, the details of which we are currently evaluating, were very strong and confirm our view that the Mountain Valley project is very attractive to a wide range of potential shippers. The next step towards firming up a commercially viable project is to convert these strong expressions of interest into binding economic commitments. We look forward to providing more details at a later date. Before turning to our expectations for 2014 and beyond, I would like to say a few words about our involvement with the Energy Future Holdings bankruptcy case. While our general policy is not to comment on individual transactions, whether real or potential, obviously, a number of documents have been publicly filed in this case and various parties have commented and speculated on our involvement. We have, on many occasions, articulated our view that we believe we have the necessary skills to effectively manage large, regulated utility businesses in a fashion that delivers value to both customers and investors. We have also indicated that we would be open to expanding our portfolio of regulated utility assets through acquisition if we can do so within acceptable financial and risk parameters and if we can see a reasonable path to all necessary regulatory approvals. With that in mind, it is no secret that we have made a tangible revised proposal to EFH in the bankruptcy court. Our commitment to Texas runs deep, having invested more than $7 billion in transmission, power generation and other operations in the Lone Star state. We also bring to the table a proven track record in the utilities industry, highlighted by strong performance in the areas of reliability, affordability and customer focus. And I will simply reiterate our belief that our revised proposal would provide substantial value to all stakeholders, including Oncor's customers. Our performance in the second quarter was stronger than we expected, and our expectations for the second half of the year have not changed significantly. Based on these observations, we now believe it is reasonable to expect our full year results to be somewhere in the range of $5.15 to $5.35 per share, even including the $0.15 of onetime effects from the launch of NEP, which, of course, were not anticipated when we originally shared with you our 2014 view back in the summer of last year. While we're very pleased with our progress so far this year, it remains to be seen how much of the "goodness of this year" will carry over into 2015 and beyond. Accordingly, at least for now, we are not changing our view of 2016 with an adjusted earnings per share range of $5.50 to $6, or 5% to 7% compound annual growth rate off a 2012 base. However, we do expect to update our view of the 2016 time frame later in the year or early in 2015 when we will have more clarity around a few important uncertainties. As always, our expectations are subject to the usual caveats we provide, including normal weather and operating conditions. Last year, we shared with you our expectations for improvements in our credit metrics for both 2013 and 2014, and we continue to be on track in terms of cash flow and leverage to meet those targets, which are fully consistent with our current ratings. Turning now to expectations for NEP. We remain confident in the forecast we presented in the S-1. We expect the initial portfolio to yield EBITDA of about $250 million and cash available for distribution of about $87 million for the 12 months through the end of June 2015, and these results should support an initial distribution at an annualized rate of $0.75 per unit. Our expectations assume normal weather and operating conditions. Looking beyond the first year, we expect unit distributions to grow about 12% to 15% per year for at least 3 years, and we believe this is achievable with the acquisition only of assets from the ROFO portfolio, assuming current market conditions. On average, we expect the ROFO portfolio to look fairly similar to the initial portfolio on a per-megawatt basis, with annual EBITDA expectations of $250,000 to $260,000 per megawatt and cash available for distribution of about $85,000 to $95,000 per megawatt, once all ROFO assets have entered into commercial operations. The last of the ROFO assets are not expected to enter service until late in 2016. While NEP has no special contractual rights to support further acquisitions, we believe it is reasonable to expect that Energy Resources will want to make available additional projects from its existing portfolio, as well as some of those currently under development. As of the end of last year, Energy Resources had another roughly 7,000-or-so megawatts of contracted renewables projects in its operating portfolio. And while not all of these projects would be suitable immediately for NEP, many or all of them could become eligible over time. In addition, we expect to have a further 1,800 to 2,300 megawatts of additional contracted renewable capacity, entering service prior to the end of 2016. And finally, beyond contracted renewables, Energy Resources has other projects that may perhaps be suitable for NEP over time. Overall, we continue to believe that NEP offers investors, by far, the largest and highest overall quality portfolio of potential assets that can help drive growth and distributions for many years to come. We expect to be in a position to provide additional ongoing, forward-looking disclosures with our third quarter conference call. With that, we will now open the line for questions. Since this is our first combined conference call for NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners, it will be helpful if you can be clear which entity you are referring to in your questions. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.
Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: I wanted to touch on Mountain Valley. And just to understand -- I understand the feedback you gave on the expressions of interest, could you speak a bit to the timing that we might expect as you assess what you received? And just better help us understand what sort of milestones we should be looking for.
James L. Robo: Sure, let me ask Armando to address that.
Armando Pimentel: Stephen, we're in the middle of going back and looking at all the expressions of interest that we received and having individual discussions to make sure that we can enter into agreements with all of the interested parties. My expectation is that by the end of this year, we will be in a position to understand whether to -- whether we're going to move forward or not with the project.
Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. So we should -- we -- you'd be communicating that back by the end of the year, it sounds like is the general time frame you're thinking? Okay.
Armando Pimentel: Yes. I'd expect it to be no later than then. We might have updates before then, but I think for investors and analysts, they should expect that by the end of the year, we should know whether we're moving forward.
Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay, great. And just over for NextEra, not NEP, but just thinking about equity needs in the future and what's -- as you think about further drop-downs into NEP. Can you talk, at least, broadly about how having NEP impacts your need for equity funding? How you think about that? Does it largely eliminate external equity requirements or -- just a little bit more color on equity needs?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Sure. The way to think about the contributions coming up from NEP from a financing perspective is to expect that they will get rolled into our overall financing plan at Capital Holdings. So obviously, that implies that at the margin, there's some implicit reduction in what are the other -- the equity -- otherwise would be. Having said that, I would just remind you what we've said previously, which is with the equity issuance last year and the forward that comes in this year, unless we see significant additional incremental CapEx, we would not expect to be coming back to the market for incremental equity.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Dan Eggers with Crédit Suisse.
Daniel L. Eggers - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Can you just give -- maybe a little more commentary on adding the natural gas reserves into rate base, kind of how the process will work with Phase 1 and then how you're thinking about layering in additional reserve additions over time? And what the commission is going to view as a successful implementation in this program?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Sure. It's pretty straightforward. We have a tangible proposition on the table right now, which we are asking the commission to approve. It has good economics for our customers. We think it makes a lot of sense from fundamentals and fundamental policy reasons. But it's just one transaction, and it's obviously very small in the context of FPL's overall gas needs. So what we are also asking for is approval of a set of guidelines, which would allow us to move forward with the potential to execute additional deals on a time frame that's consistent with the commercial realities of doing business in that upstream space. Obviously, the decision-making time frame commercially for the plans in that sector is fairly rapid and we would want to have agreement and essentially the blessing of the PSC that within certain parameters, we would be okay to go ahead with additional deals. Having said that, all deals, even if they're executed, are going to be subject to annual review through the fuel clause filings, so the commission would still maintain oversight over the specifics of each transaction.
Daniel L. Eggers - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: And how comfortable do you guys feel about the scaling of those projects? And how much fuel would you like to ultimately have from controlled reserves versus buying in the market?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Well, we haven't set an ultimate target yet. Obviously, it could be very significant over time. Our main focus is on establishing the framework and getting started on the program, but clearly, we think there are plenty of other potential opportunities over time. They may not come in a smooth, steady stream. Obviously, that's going to depend upon the commercial realities in the upstream space. But it's very clear that from a customer perspective, if we can convert what is today a variable and uncontrolled cost into something that's much more predictable, there's real value to customers in doing that.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Can you kind of just think about your rationale of not stripping out that $0.15 and kind of given that we are incurring that now and guidance is unchanged, where the upside came from to maintain guidance?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Well, there's a number of areas. As we said, the wind resource was strong, so that was our expectations are always around this average wind resource. We had that. The Seabrook outage was shorter than we'd expected. Some of the customer supply transactions that we closed this quarter pushed us a little bit above where we had otherwise expected to be. We were a little bit better on our interest rates. There was a whole variety of areas, but when you put them all together -- there was also a little bit on the FPL side. The wholesale results were a little bit stronger there, so there was a number of areas that have pushed us up.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then in a couple of places in your slide deck, on the one hand, we had 109% of normal wind. But then when you're talking about NEP, you said the wind and solar resources was very slightly above normal. Is this just the different geographies of the assets?
Moray P. Dewhurst: It's probably the different geographies and probably, the solar was actually below expectations.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: And then -- I'm sorry, just got -- do you have a pro forma of what NextEra Energy Resources would have looked like under the new NEP accounting?
Moray P. Dewhurst: No, we don't.
Operator: We will take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: So kind of a twin question relating to the parent company. Can you talk a little bit about how to minimize dilution from the sell-downs to NEP and the roll-down of the ROFOs. And perhaps, coupled with that, discuss the 2016 outlook. You mentioned that you're looking for clarity on a few caveats later this year to perhaps provide an update. What are those key moving variables that limit you from providing that update today as you think about it?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Okay. On the first -- again, maybe I'm just repeating what I said earlier, but the way to think about the proceeds coming up as they get rolled into the overall financing program. So in the short term, if you have a particular transaction, an acquisition by NEP of Energy Resources' assets, there will be some temporary accounting dilutive aspect until you have moved forward and adjusted your financing structure, so that your credit metrics are back where they would be, but that's going to be a relatively small amount. So it shouldn't meaningfully move the numbers. It will make this year, for example, very -- well, maybe there's $0.01 of effective dilution from that affect, so -- but then going forward, we just integrate it into the overall financing plan. On the 2016 outlook, obviously, by the end of the year, we will know where we are on the election here in Florida. We'll have a much better insight into where we are on completing the portfolio, the backlog portfolio of renewables and projects, we're working on a number of things there that we are pretty optimistic will come to pass, but we'll know a lot more by the end of the year on that front. Of course, the other thing is we'll know a lot more where we are on the PTC.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Right, absolutely, and to that point, can you discuss real quickly, what is your -- you didn't change your outlook per se, but I'm curious, is the potential for PTC extension delaying PPA sign-ups? And then coupled with that also, are you -- what is the outlook for third-party acquisitions? And has your view on third-party acquisitions down at the NEP level changed in light of the relative currency that you have in hand?
Armando Pimentel: Julien, it's Armando. I think the uncertainty about the PTC and when it would be extended this year certainly caused a lull, in our view, in [Audio Gap] towards the very end of the session this year. I'll let Moray answer the NEP question.
Moray P. Dewhurst: So in terms of outlook for third-party acquisitions, I don't think the existence of NEP has fundamentally changed our view. We've always been very active in the market for third-party acquisitions. We'll continue to be, but we've also historically been disciplined in our pricing there, and we expect to continue to be disciplined. I do think it gives us a different vehicle. So depending upon the nature of the potential acquisition, it might fit better in NEP, or it might fit better in Energy Resources. In general, I think that if we see something that requires what I'll call a fair degree of cleanup, for example, perhaps a project that hypothetically we see having some operational improvement potential or requiring a contract restructuring, something of that nature. Other things equal, it would seem logical that we would start with that at the Energy Resources level, work on making those improvements and then make it available to Energy Partners because the key part of the strategy at NEP is to have clean and derisked projects because those are clearly what the investors in NEP value very highly. So to the extent to which the potential asset was already very clean in that sense, it might be a suitable candidate for direct acquisition by Energy Partners. But those are just kind of a conceptual guidelines obviously that we'd have to see in any practical situation. But I think we'll continue to be very competitive.
Operator: We will take our next question with Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Sort of quickly on Slide 7, the load growth -- I'm sorry if I missed -- what caused the 1.3% nonweather-related decrease?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Well, I guess the bottom line is we're not sure. That's the underlying usage growth and other is essentially a residual from our calculations. So we apply our regular forecasting model which says, okay, given what happened with temperature, given what happened with the economy, given what happened with relative pricing, here is what we should have expect and so this is really measured relative to that, which is one of the reasons that it is often volatile from quarter-to-quarter. Having said that, I think what we're seeing in here, although I can't be sure of the exact reasons, is some reduction in usage or lower-than-expected usage among the higher volume customers because the lower volume customers, the metrics associated with them, all look pretty good. So I think what we're seeing is some -- among higher-volume customers, whether that is deliberate conservation efforts, whether it's the effect of more energy efficiency than we have anticipated, we're not sure. So we're going to be digging into those numbers to figure out what we can about what's going on there. But do recognize that from quarter-to-quarter, just mix impacts within the customer base can have quite an impact, an indirect impact on that residual usage.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Okay. And then on Oncor, looking at the legislation that was 13-64 [ph] last year regarding the sort of standalone tax concept and what-have-you, how should one think about -- or what can you share with us the potential use of leverage in an acquisition such as Oncor? I mean, one might think that it could be substantial. I'm just wondering if...
Moray P. Dewhurst: Yes. I really can't say anything more than we shared in the prepared remarks.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Okay. Fair enough, but I tried though. Okay, so then -- and then finally, on the structured transactions in the trading and marketing of $0.07, could you give us a little bit of flavor for what happened there? What the nature of that is, I guess?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Sure. We've, for a long time, been in the business of tailoring power and gas products to meet particular customers' needs. Commonly, these customers are munis and co-ops in different parts of the country, who don't necessarily have the capability to manage all their varying energy needs directly. And typically, these will be for kind of nonstandard amounts of power varying over the course of the year or varying over years. So they're sort of customized products in that way, but they're still relatively straightforward in that they're power and gas delivered to particular locations. And so we will customize the product to meet that need and then essentially back-to-back it, hedge out the components in the regular market. And there's obviously a spread to be made on that. I would say that with the pullback of some of the major financial services firms from the physical commodity world, we've been seeing perhaps a few more of those kinds of opportunities more recently. So it's good business, it maintains relationships with the folks who are often customers of ours on the wind side. So it provides a nice extra portion of the mix.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Okay. Is it sort of like a gain-on-sale, though, when you do these transactions? Or is this sort of an accrual kind of -- how should we think about sort of the ongoing nature of something like this sort of structured transaction, in other words, do you take a gain as you do these transactions or is there more like an annuity stream? How should we think about that?
Moray P. Dewhurst: It's a little bit of both, and it depends on the nature of the transaction. Mostly, they are an accrual transaction; occasionally, they may have an element of mark-to-market upfront. We try and minimize that portion for obvious reasons. It's better to spread them out over time. But depending upon the specific nature of the deal, the accounting may require you to take a day 1 gain, so to speak.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: So that $0. 07 just sort of -- the flavor of that would you say is mostly accrual or mostly sort of mark-to-market? Onetime-ish? How should we sort of think about that?
Moray P. Dewhurst: I would say it's mostly stuff that continues on.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research.
Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC: Just a couple of things. First, do you an official schedule for the EMP [ph] approval?
Moray P. Dewhurst: I'm going to turn to Eric. I'm not sure that the PSC has formally scheduled it. We're certainly hoping to have a decision by at least the early part of next year.
Eric E. Silagy: Steve, this is Eric. So we're right now working with the staff of the PSC and other interested parties on schedule. We're hoping for hearings in October, and then we're still hoping for a decision by the PSC sometime by the end of the year, beginning of next year at the latest.
Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC: Okay. And then just a question on NEP. We never really, because of the filing and your kind of inability to comment once you file the S-1. We never really got the kind of story on why this is good for NextEra and how you made the decision and the like. And I don't know, if you could just spend a short bit of time on how this is -- how you see the value of this to NextEra?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Sure. Obviously, there's different ways of looking at it -- and I think different individuals look at it somewhat differently -- for myself, I view it very much as a way to highlight the value of a very attractive portion of the portfolio that arguably wasn't receiving full value in the existing structure. As I had sort of hinted at in the response to an earlier question, a lot of what we are really doing in separating out the assets that are part of NEP is segregating 2 distinct aspects of the business in Energy Resources. There is the development construction early stage operations, getting a project to the point where it is, as I referred to it earlier, clean and derisked. And then there's the long-term ownership of the financial interest in those assets. Those 2 aspects of the business are really quite different. They have different risk profiles, and they can certainly appeal in differing degrees to different sets of investors. And what we've done through creating NEP is we've really created a vehicle that allows us to segregate those activities. And in so doing, I think we've highlighted, begun to highlight the real value of those -- of that long-term financial interest in those projects. So to me, it's mostly about highlighting of the value, but we've done so in a fashion that I believe promotes alignment of interests, and that speaks to obviously the structural characteristics of NEP. Other people are going to see it somewhat differently. So a common way, but certainly a number of investors have expressed it and folks internally just see it as accessing a lower-cost source of capital. So I think there's a number of ways, in a sense, different sides of the same coin, but I see it as really highlighting the value.
Operator: We will take our next question from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.
Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: One or 2 nuts-or-bolts questions. Florida Power & Light O&M for the quarter and year-to-date, basically flat year-over-year. Just curious, is there anything unusual in kind of the quarters for 2014? Do you still expect kind of flattish O&M in '14? Anything that could make second half of 2014 higher or lower than second half of 2013?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Well, recall that we undertook this initiative that we call Project Momentum last year. And that produced a great many ideas that, in FPL's case, will deliver O&M savings over time. Not surprisingly, those savings tend to build over time. So we would expect the full year for 2014 O&M at FPL actually to be down relative to 2013. So you should definitely expect the second half to be down. But there's nothing particular that I can point to there because the gains from Project Momentum were very widely shared across different parts of the organization. So it's really progress in all areas. We're very pleased with the way the implementation of those initiatives have been going. We're actually a little bit ahead of where we had expected to be. Recall, of course, that those don't directly affect FPL earnings because of the nature of the settlement agreement. So if we do better than we expect on O&M, that simply gets reflected in the amount of [indiscernible] depreciation that we adjust. But that's really what's going on there.
Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then when thinking about NEP's portfolio over time, and when I say over time, I mean multiple, multiple years, and the risk profile of NEP. Just curious for your thoughts, it's one thing we've got renewable assets in there that honestly have very, very, very low maintenance CapEx or even kind of onetime CapEx requirements and have 25- or 30-year contracts. How do you think about what adding other types of assets whether it's gas fire, power play [ph] typically have shorter-term contracts or whether it's nuclear, where they may have longer-term arrangement, but there's also, I don't know, kind of binary capital spending risks? Meaning, Crystal River 3 or Songs [ph] or Davis Besse-related risks that just kind of don't exist with a lot of other type of power plants. How do you think about the pros and cons of adding to the EBITDA and the cafte [ph] for NextEra Energy Partners by putting nonrenewable assets? Even something like a T&D utility in there versus the potential impact on maybe valuation or multiples or CapEx, given kind of what the CapEx risk looks likes for those other types of assets versus the CapEx risk of a renewable plant?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Okay. Let me try and address that in a number of pieces because I think there's a lot of things in there. I think the short answer is, we are going to evaluate all those issues that you've just talked about over time, and we're going to receive, I suspect, a lot of investor feedback, and that will help us in our evaluation. One of the great things you pointed out, but you're talking many years down the road -- one of the great things about the NEP position is it can look to long-term sustained growth simply through adding contracted renewable projects, which it may hope to acquire from the sponsor, so long before you have to even consider some of the things that you've just raised in your question. Having said that, let me take the [indiscernible] assets, clearly, there are examples in the market where those assets have been added to a yieldco-type portfolio, so it clearly can be done. I think there are a couple of issues that go different ways. On the one hand, you get an extra dimension of diversity, so that should be attractive to an NEP investor. But as you pointed out, they do have different characteristics. So I think we're just going to have to evaluate the relative weight of those -- broadly speaking, those 2 factors and see what investor reactions are. And the same general criteria apply as you start thinking about extending the universe of assets more broadly, although introducing even more complexities. So for example in the nuclear assets, obviously, the binary nature of an event risk that you're implicitly referring to would need to be taken into account. I don't know, but I suspect that, that's not a kind of risk profile that most of the NEP investors would be particularly -- would be pricing into their valuation today. So we need to see what the reaction is. So there might be structures that you would need to put in place to isolate that portion of the risk. In a sense, it goes back to the response of a couple of earlier questions, which is one of the nice things about the NEP platform, is that it enables us to segregate out different types of activities and focus them in the 2 different companies. And in particular, I suspect that means there will be -- we will take on specific types of risks within Energy Resources and NextEra Energy that we would not take on within NextEra Energy Partners.
Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Got it. Last question, any update on transmission investment opportunities -- electric transmission investment opportunities outside of Florida?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Not a lot new to report. As I've said on a number of occasions to many folks, the transmission development business is long-term in nature. The decision-making time frame for a lot of these projects, particularly the ones that go through the regional, the ISOs, the ITOs, tends to be fairly long. And so nothing in particular, the project, the development project in Canada is moving along as we would expect. We continue to have a very healthy portfolio of initiatives that we're working on. But as I've also said many times before, all of these things are long-term in nature. So things that would not begin to contribute before 2018 or 2019 in most cases.
Operator: We will take our next question from Greg Gordon with ISI Group.
Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: So 2 questions. First on the TXU transaction. I know you can't comment specifically on it, but can I ask a broader question with regard to your philosophy on acquiring regulated assets? So when you talk -- when you think about what acceptable financial and risk parameters are, in any, like, acquisitions with any, regulated utility, what are the cornerstones sort of financial pillars of your decision-making? For instance, with the Wisconsin acquisition of TEG, they had never commented explicitly on any transaction but always had said had to be accretive in the first full year, not too dilutive to growth rate, not too dilutive to credit. So can you sort of give a comparable set of characteristics that you look for when you think about the price you're willing to pay and the risk you're willing to take in acquiring an additional regulated asset?
Moray P. Dewhurst: I'm not sure I can give a comprehensive list, but let me just try and provide some color at least around that. Recognize that your ability to add value in these situations depends upon your ability to develop synergies across 2 platforms, to improve operations in a platform that you may acquire or to find other ways of delivering incremental value on which the shareholder may hope to earn a regulated rate of return. So you have to look at what is the realistic potential to create value. And while that can be quite meaningful in this industry, it is typically not as large when expressed as a percentage of the existing market value as you will see in many other industries. So you've got to make sure that you can retain significant portion of the value that you create for your investors; otherwise, there's no point in doing the transaction. And that obviously, in turn, depends upon the terms on which you can expect to get regulatory approval. We would certainly want to make sure that anything that we do is supportive of our existing credit position. As we said on many occasions, we're very comfortable with our credit position, it's an important, competitive weapon to us. So we certainly would not want it to be dilutive to credit. We have traditionally said that with respect to accretion, dilution, while we don't have any absolute hard-and-fast rules, if a transaction is significantly dilutive in the first couple of years, that's usually a warning sign about its fundamental economics. So there can be some particular accounting reasons why an individual transaction might be dilutive in the first year, but normally, that should be a red flag.
Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: The final question is circling back to the opportunity to create value by hedging out your risk through reverse integrating into natural gas. Someone asked you that question earlier. You indicated that the request that you're making is only to sort of hedge out about 2.9% of your expected 2015 gas burn, and your gas burn is likely to rise in the future by a fair amount. If we want to sort of size up the potential expenditures, if you were to fully hedge, and I understand you'd never do that, is it fair to just take the $70 million to $190 million range and sort of gross that up, so that hypothetically, if the regulator were to say, look, we'd like you to hedge it all, that the range of the potential spending would be sort of $2.4 billion to $6.5 billion? Or is that way over simplifying the math?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Yes. I'm not sure that it's going to scale linearly, certainly as you get up higher and higher, but for the first few percent, it probably is not far off.
Operator: That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the NextEra Energy 2014 First Quarter Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Amanda Finnis. Please go ahead.
Amanda Finnis: Thank you, Lisa. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter 2014 earnings conference call. With me, this morning, are Jim Robo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; Moray Dewhurst, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; Armando Pimentel, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources; and Eric Silagy, President of Florida Power & Light Company. Jim will get us started today with opening remarks, and then Moray will provide an overview of our results. Our executive team will then be available to answer your questions. We will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call in the Risk Factors section of the accompanying presentation or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website, www.nexteraenergy.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. Today's presentation also includes references to adjusted earnings, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliation of non-GAAP measure to the closest GAAP financial measure. With that, I will turn the call over to Jim.
James L. Robo: Thanks, Amanda, and good morning, everyone. Before I turn the call over to Moray to discuss our first quarter results, I'd like to take a moment to update you on an important topic. As you all know, for some months now we've been assessing the possibility of forming a so-called yieldco. After extensive analysis and careful thought, we've made the judgment that it is in the best interest of our shareholders for us to take the next step in this process. And on April 4, we've filed confidentially with the SEC a draft S-1 registration statement, which would allow us to move forward with a yieldco structure following the SEC review process and subject to market conditions. Unfortunately, having given you this information, we're now very restricted from offering you the additional information that I know you will all be looking for. As you may know, there is a concern that conveying the information about the yieldco at this time might be construed by the SEC as a prohibited offer of securities under the SEC rules, which in turn could lead to delays in our ability to move forward with the transaction. Accordingly, we've concluded that it would be best to wait until after the S-1 is public before providing more detail. Thus, we'll not be able to discuss with you today such matters as the exact projects or megawatts involved over time or the financial performance of the assets that we expect to make available for purchase by the yieldco, or many other things that I know you will have questions about. Further, while it is our present intention to move forward with this transaction, there can be no guarantee that we will be able to execute successfully on terms that we believe will create long-term value for our shareholders, which remains our objective. We will continue to work diligently to ensure that we remain focused on this fundamental goal. While there is much that we cannot discuss at this stage, there are a few points that I can make. First, we've previously said that we would want to be sure that the introduction of the yieldco structure would not be negative to credit since our credit position is an important underpinning of our competitive strategy. The fact that we are moving forward obviously implies that we've developed comfort that this objective is achievable, while the principal control on this will be the integration of the yieldco into our overall financing plan in such a way that our credit metrics are maintained or strengthened. We will also be sensitive to the impact on our portfolio mix going forward. We expect to continue to place emphasis on developing new high-quality contracted projects at Energy Resources. Our view with the credit impact of our proposed transaction is based not only on our own assessment but also on our discussions with the rating agencies. Second, we have also previously stated that one area of focus for us would be to ensure as close an alignment of interest is possible between our existing shareholders and investors in the yieldco vehicle. We believe we've developed a suitable structure to support the same, and I look forward to sharing details with you at a later date. Third, many of you have previously heard me say that an area of concern for us would be the cost and other implications on ongoing reporting and compliance obligations for 2 publicly traded entities. We now feel comfortable that we will be able to manage these effectively. And while they will undoubtedly be extra costs, we did not believe they will detract meaningfully from our ability to create value for NextEra Energy shareholders through the transaction. Finally, let me reiterate that while our decisions are based on extensive analysis and careful consideration, in the end we're making judgments about future value creation, and there can be no guarantee we're correct. With these comments aside, I'm also pleased to be able to tell you that we had an excellent first quarter overall notwithstanding some challenges associated with the harsh winter in the Northeast, and we're off to a good start for the year. I'll now turn the call over to Moray to fill you in on the details.
Moray P. Dewhurst: Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. As Jim said, we had an excellent first quarter overall. Our financial and operating performance was very strong, and we continued to make good progress on our capital projects and other strategic initiatives consistent with the strategies we discussed in our investor conference over a year ago. We continue to believe we are well positioned to deliver against the financial expectations we shared with you out through the 2016 time frame. At Florida Power & Light, we continue to drive value for our customers through low bills, high reliability and excellent customer service, and for our shareholders through strong earnings growth. For the fifth year in a row, our typical residential customer bills are the lowest in the state, and are currently about 25% below the national average. Our major capital projects remain on track, and I'm pleased to note that the second of our 3 generation modernization projects at Riviera Beach entered service just after the end of the first quarter, about 2 months earlier than originally anticipated, and slightly below the cost estimates submitted to the PSC in 2008. Construction has begun on the Port Everglades modernization, which we expect to come on line in mid-2016. During the quarter, we invested another $1 billion of capital in FPL, consistent with our strategy of steadily improving the long-term value we offer our customers. At Energy Resources, our development and construction programs remain on track, and our backlog of contracted renewables projects continues to develop with the PPA for roughly 250 megawatts of U.S. wind signed since the last call. Increased contributions from our contracted renewables portfolio continue to drive earnings growth. The extreme market conditions in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic, particularly during January, caused parts of our customer supply business to underperform, but this impact turned out to be less than we had expected, and was offset by other favorable impacts, many of which were driven by the same factors that caused the underperformance in customer supply. Overall, we were pleased with the quarter. Now let's look at the results for FPL before moving on to Energy Resources and then the consolidated numbers. For the first quarter of 2014, FPL reported net income of $347 million or $0.79 per share, up $0.11 per share year-over-year. We continue to focus on deploying capital productively in ways that have long-term benefits to customers. As I mentioned, FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $1 billion in the quarter, and we expect our full year capital investments to be roughly $3.3 billion. Regulatory capital employed grew 6.7% over the same quarter last year, which combined with an increasing profitability resulted in very strong net income growth. Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes is estimated to be 11.22% for the 12 months ended March 2014. This includes the impact of the Project Momentum transition cost incurred late last year. You will recall the Project Momentum is our enterprise-wide productivity initiative that we started last year. Absent these costs, regulatory ROE would have been 11.5%. As a reminder, the impact of the 2013 transition costs will roll off our reported regulatory ROE as we move through the year since the regulatory ROE is measured on a 12 month trailing basis. Based on the progress we've made this -- excuse me -- made thus far in our cost position, the continued improvement in the Florida economy, our current capital investment program, and the amount of reserve amortization were taken to date, we are now comfortable targeting regulatory ROE at 11.5% for the full year 2014. As we noted last quarter, under the current rate agreement, we record reserve amortization entries to achieve a predetermined regulatory ROE for each 12-month trailing period. In this case, the 11.5% that I just mentioned, excluding special charges, such as the Project Momentum transition costs. We utilized $125 million of reserved amortization during the quarter in order to achieve this predetermined ROE. As we mentioned before, we always expect to use more reserve amortization in the first half of the year than the second half given the pattern of our underlying revenues and expenses. In fact, over the remainder of the year, assuming normal weather and operating conditions, we would expect to reverse the reserve amortization taken in the first quarter and end the year with a balance roughly equal to where we started or possibly even a little better. Looking beyond 2014, we believe that our reserve balance when combined with our weather-normalized sales growth forecast of 1.5% to 2% per year, and our current O&M expectations, as well as a commitment of a full-year total of roughly $7 billion in infrastructure CapEx, will allow us to support regulatory ROEs in the upper half of the allowed band of 9.5% to 11.5% for the remaining period of the current rate agreement. Furthermore, we expect that we can do this while keeping typical residential customer bills the lowest in the state and among the lowest in the country and improving on our already excellent reliability in customer service records. If we are successful in meeting our expectations, by 2016 we will have further improved our already outstanding customer value proposition and will be well positioned for 2017 and beyond. The Florida economy continues to strengthen, and since 2010, most of the indicators we track continue to improve, particularly in the areas of job growth, business expansion and businesses that have relocated into the state. This is due in part to a focused effort of the state on economic development, and an overall improvement in the business climate, including reductions in taxes benefiting businesses and individual taxpayers alike. The state's relative economic position compared with the U.S. overall has improved significantly since 2010. Florida's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in March was 6.3%, down 1.4 percentage points from a year ago. The number of jobs in Florida was up 225,100, an increase of 3% compared to a year earlier, and March was the 44th consecutive month with a positive job growth in Florida following more than 3 years of job losses. Nationally, the number of jobs was up 1.7% over the year. Florida's annual job growth rate has exceeded the nation's rate since April 2012. Florida's private sector continues to drive the state's job growth, and more than 550,000 private sector jobs have been added since December 2010. The housing market in Florida also continues to show signs of resiliency. As the accompanying chart shows, new building permits have dropped from their recent peak, although they remained at a healthy level, and mortgage delinquency rates continue to decline. The Case-Shiller Index for South Florida shows home prices up 16% from the prior year. Other positive economic data across the state include continued improvement in retail taxable sales, as well as bankruptcies declining on an annual basis. Overall, Florida's economy continues to progress well. FPL's customer metrics showed solid improvement this quarter. Underlying usage per customer increased 0.4% compared to the same quarter last year, which is consistent with our long-term expectation of approximately 0.5% per year, net of the impact of efficiency and conservation programs at least through the period of the rate agreement. However, as we've often pointed out, usage growth tends to be volatile from quarter-to-quarter. Another encouraging development during the quarter was a decrease in the percentage of low usage customers, the 12-month average of the low-usage percentage has fallen to 8.1%, its lowest level since May 2007. The number of inactive accounts has also continued to decline, reaching its lowest level since April 2004. During the first quarter, we also saw the largest average increase in customers since late 2007, with approximately 87,000 more customers than in the comparable quarter of 2013, representing an increase of 1.9%. However, roughly 0.9% of the increase can be attributed to the rollout of our remote connect and disconnect capability enabled by our smart meter program that we highlighted last year. As a reminder, these new customers, which are disproportionately low-usage and residential, have a lower impact on our sales. We estimate that customer growth accounted for about 1.1% of the increase in sales during the quarter. Good usage and customer growth combined with a favorable year-over-year weather effect of 2.9% to yield overall retail sales growth of 4.4%. Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported first quarter 2014 GAAP earnings of $86 million or $0.20 per share. Adjusted earnings for the first quarter were $211 million or $0.48 per share. During the quarter, we reversed our prior decision to sell off fossil assets in Maine. As a reminder, the Maine fossil assets are a combined 796 megawatts of oil-fired power plants operating within the NEPOOL market. In last year's first quarter call, we announced plans to adjust our portfolio by selling these assets, and we conducted a competitive bid process during the fall and winter. However, the bids we received were not consistent with our view of the fundamental value of the assets, and recent developments in regional market conditions have reinforced this assessment. While these assets are not called upon to run frequently, they do play an important role in supporting the reliability of the electric system, and this has real economic value. Accordingly, we have decided to retain these assets as an integral part of our New England portfolio. As a result of our decision to retain these assets, we have recognized an after-tax gain of $12 million during the quarter based on the current estimated fair value of the fossil assets, and we have reclassified from discontinued operations to income from continuing operations the after-tax loss recorded during the first quarter of last year. The gain in 2014 and the loss in 2013 are both excluded from adjusted earnings. The financial impact from operations of these assets for both periods is included in both GAAP and adjusted results. Energy Resources' adjusted EPS contribution increased $0.06 from the prior year comparable quarter. New wind and solar investments added $0.06 per share, reflecting continued strong contributions from growth in our contract and renewables portfolio. Across the balance of the portfolio, the aggregate of other impacts was flat. However, because there were individually significant ups and downs and some of the elements were interrelated, let me provide a few more details. As discussed earlier in the call, our results suffered from the adverse effect of extreme winter volatility on our full requirements business in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic. This negative effect on the full requirements portfolio was much larger than the positive impacts on other parts of the customer supply and trading portfolio, and the overall contribution from all these businesses was down $0.11 per share. Despite this challenge, and in some cases, as a result of the same extreme market conditions, there were opportunities in other parts of the portfolio. Contributions from existing assets increased $0.14 per share, including $0.05 from existing wind assets net of PTC roll-off as a result of favorable generation. The same weather system that drove the challenging market conditions in the Northeast also resulted in above average wind resource from many of our wind sites. The same market conditions also meant that the contribution from our Maine Fossil assets increased $0.03. Finally, there were a number of smaller favorable impact across other parts of the portfolio that collectively added up to $0.06. Increased corporate G&A and other costs contributed negative $0.04 for the year-over-year change, including share dilution of negative $0.02. All other effects were minor as reflected on the accompanying slide. For the full year, we expect to elect CITCs on roughly 265 megawatts from our Mountain View Solar project and the portions of Genesis and Desert Sunlight solar project that are expected to enter service in 2014. This equates to roughly $60 million in adjusted earnings, down from roughly $70 million in 2013 on 280 megawatts of solar projects. The Energy Resources team continues to execute on our backlog and pursue additional contracted renewable development opportunities. In Canada, we continue to expect the 466 megawatts in our backlog to enter service by the end of 2015 with the majority expected to come into service in 2014. Our contracted U.S. solar backlog remains on track. And during the quarter, we brought roughly 170 -- 165 megawatts of solar into service with the commissioning of Mountain View, the balance of Genesis and partial commissioning of Desert Sunlight. We continue to expect to bring the remaining roughly 650 megawatts of our backlog into service by the end of 2016. In addition to our existing contracted backlog, we continue to pursue additional solar opportunities, including possibly 1 large 250 megawatt project, and a development pipeline of smaller 10- to 40-megawatt projects. Turning to our U.S. wind program, we commissioned roughly 75 megawatts during the first quarter. Additionally, the team recently signed a PPA for roughly 250-megawatt project, which is expected to come into service in 2015, bringing our total contracted U.S. wind development program for 2013 through 2015 to approximately 1,675 megawatts. Based on everything we see at the moment, we continue to believe our total 2013 to 2015 U.S. wind program could be 2,000 to 2,500 megawatts. Turning now with the consolidated results, for the first quarter of 2014, NextEra Energy's GAAP net income was $430 million or $0.98 per share. NextEra Energy's 2014 first quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $557 million and $1.26, respectively. Adjusted earnings from the Corporate & Other Segment were down $0.03 per share compared to the first quarter of 2013, primarily due to consolidating tax adjustments. As we noted last quarter, financial results and project updates for the pipeline projects will be reported as part of our Corporate & Other business segment. Both pipeline projects, Sabal Trail Transmission and Florida Southeast Connection, continue to progress well through their respective development processes, and we expect to submit necessary filings with FERC later this year. We expect to receive FERC approval sometime in 2015, and we expect the projects to be in service by mid-2017. Spectra Energy Partners, majority owner of Sabal Trail Transmission, continues to meet the effort to market additional available capacity on the upstream pipeline to potential shippers, and detail siting and environmental activities are under way on both pipelines. At this point early in the year we're very pleased with our progress. Our first quarter results ended up being a little better than we had expected, but we see nothing to cause us to change our view for the full year. Second quarter comparisons will be challenged by the fact that Seabrook has an outage this year, but we expect the second half of the year to show solid growth supporting a full year 2014 adjusted earnings per share range of $5.05 to $5.45. In the appendix, we provide a number of sensitivities around our 2014 expectations. Looking ahead to 2016, we see nothing that would change the range of earnings expectations we provided during March 2013 for 2016. We continue to expect adjusted earnings per share for 2016 to be in the range of $5.50 to $6, which is consistent with EPS growth at a compound annual growth rate of 5% to 7% through 2016 off a 2012 base. As always, our expectations are subject to the usual caveats we provide, including normal weather and operating conditions. And with that, we'll now open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from UBS.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: I wanted to ask just quickly if you could -- I know you can't comment specifically on the yieldco, but as you think about your broader renewables commitment, how does this change your view on what is possible from a development perspective? And I suppose could you address that both from the utility scale and from a smaller scale perspective on solar and wind?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Well, as Jim said in the prepared remarks, we are limited in what we can say. All I can really say is that we continue to believe that we will see long-term growth in demand for renewables in this country. We continue to believe that we will be well positioned to compete to gain a share of that demand, and that demand will be seen both on the wind and the solar side varied by geography, but beyond that I really can't go.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Excellent. And I suppose just in thinking about what is within the context of eligible, is it fair to say that your prior comments still apply?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Again, I can't really say anything more than we've said to date.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. Fair enough, just trying to get that out there. And then just secondly, as you look at the expectation for double tier, we've heard -- I suppose a little bit on the PTC expansion. What are your thoughts? What are you seeing out there in the market as a result of that? Does that mean that clients potentially are pushing out their desire to lock up contracts given the potential for the extension? How has that changed the dynamics as best you see it?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Well, I'll ask Armando to offer some more details. But just generally, I would say there continues to be good interest. We're in active dialogue with a number of customers. But as always, the uncertainty about the extension of the PTC does play in. So at this point, I think there is very good odds that we will see another extension in the PTC. But obviously, the uncertainty does affect how that plays out in the marketplace. Armando?
Armando Pimentel: I don't have anything to add to that one.
Operator: And we'll go next to Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.
Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: I wanted to just talk about the growth in solar and from a strategic point of view how you think about the approach. We're seeing more distributed solar done both residential and commercial. And there the economics you really under net metering rules, there is potentially very good margin in the sense of -- as solar installation costs drop you're able to arbitrage most of the utility bill, whereas in large solar projects its often still done under RFP and somewhat competitive in that regard. How do you think about the growth in solar in terms of, take for example in commercial solar? Do you see potentially going down market in a sense of smaller projects over time? Or do you think you'll likely remain fairly a large-scale in terms of as you think about solar?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Well, Steven, we're certainly going to continue to have a concentration on large-scale solar projects. As I think you know we have had now for some time a relatively small development effort in the distributed C&I space. So we do think that there will be some opportunities there. But I guess the main comment that I would make on this subject is that in sort of broad strategy terms, we want to try and be aligned with what we perceive to be the long-term fundamentals of economics, and even with -- regardless of how prices are coming down, we continue to see the fundamental economics of larger-scale solar projects dominating those of small-scale solar projects, particularly the very small-scale solar projects such as residential rooftop. So we recognize that there is a market opportunity for some folks, driven by, I would say, specific market rules, but we are a little leery when those market rules really don't match up with the underlying economics. So for the long-term, we want our development activity to be aligned with the fundamentals of the economics.
James L. Robo: I would just add, Steven, this is Jim, that I think it's really dangerous to assume that from a rate design standpoint across utilities across the country that they're not going to very aggressively address the fact that there is a effectively a net metering subsidy in non-solar rooftop. Residential solar rooftop users are effectively paying the grid costs of the solar rooftop users through -- as a result of the net metering subsidy. I think it's very dangerous to assume that utilities aren't going to aggressively address that through rate design over the next several years.
Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Excellent color and very fair point. Understood. And just in Florida, as we look, we've seen a lot of potential legislative activity on solar. Are there any things in particular we should be most focused on as we watch? It's honestly hard to tell the noise from the substance in terms of just the variety of potential legislative activity. Any further color you can add on solar legislative activity in Florida?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Well, I'll ask Eric to comment specifically, but what's going on in Florida here, at least from our perspective, is that we believe there are some opportunities to introduce more solar into the system, and we want to come forward with proposals that are the most economic for our customers. But on the political, Eric, do you have any thoughts?
Eric E. Silagy: What I would add is that the -- this week is the last week of the legislative session for 2014. So it's going to end on Friday. There's no pending legislation with regards to any type of solar or renewables at this point. And as Moray said, we're exploring opportunities where it makes economic sense. But there has being a real focus by the legislative body to make sure that primarily power prices stay affordable and customers have the lowest bills possible.
Operator: And we'll go next to Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Just -- I'm sorry, if I missed this. Did you guys -- or can you guys say when the S-1 the public one will be filed?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Well, the timing obviously depends upon the SEC review process. I would hope that we would be talking a matter of several weeks rather than several months.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Okay, great. And then just to make sure the -- just wanted to follow-up on the merchant -- the main merchant stuff and the change reversal. Are you guys -- has there been any strategic change with respect to merchant exposure strategically because of changes in the market or anything? Or is this just simply because of this 1 asset that you're being offered and what have you?
Moray P. Dewhurst: It's really specific to the asset. And also, to be fair, how the asset fits into our portfolio. It has a distribution of outcomes that is not at all symmetrical, but it -- when it does well it offsets other parts of the portfolio that may not be doing so well. But it was fundamentally a question of the value that we were receiving in the bids wasn't consistent with our view in the fundamentals. And obviously the fundamentals of that market has strengthened a little bit relative to this time last year when we originally made the decision to put it up for sale.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Okay. But there's been no change in your move to more contracted and what-have-you assets, is that correct?
Moray P. Dewhurst: That's correct. In terms of new development activities, you're going to see pretty much everything we do will continue to be in contracted space.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Okay. And then just finally on the weather impact, I just wasn't clear on a normalized earnings basis. What the -- I saw the $0.11 that was negative and I saw the 2.9% sales growth. I just wasn't clear about what -- and I'm sorry if I missed it -- what the net-net sort of weather impact was for the quarter on a U.S. basis?
Moray P. Dewhurst: You really can't look at the net weather impact for us as an enterprise. You have to look at the 2 businesses separately. Because they're accounting for the rate agreement, the weather impact at FPL is absorbed into the overall calculation and effectively is adjusted out by the use of surplus depreciation, because we are effectively managing to the predetermined ROE. So it has a longer-term impact, but it doesn't have a direct impact in the short-term. On the Energy Resources side, wind -- on a year-over-year basis, wind resource contributed about $0.09, so $0.09 up versus the year. So the pure resource component was about $0.09.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Versus the $0.11 negative, right?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Yes. Okay. To be fair, I mean, not all of the $0.09 can directly be attributed to the weather, but associated with $0.11, if you understand what I mean.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Steven Fleishman from Wolfe Research.
Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC: First, just wanted to ask on the utility. The -- so just wanted to understand, the 11.5% ROE is what you expect to earn within the guidance for this year, and it's just a matter of how much is kind of -- the amortization was around to kind of get you to that and the more you can do, yes.
Moray P. Dewhurst: Yes, that's a fair characterization. So for this year, we will be at 11.5%. And as I've said in the prepared remarks, looking forward, based on where we are at the moment, we think, we can continue to be in the upper half of the 9.5% to 11.5% allowed range.
Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC: Okay. And on the SEC process, maybe you could just make sure we understand the way the private filings work. So you file it, we don't know when you filed it, we don't know when it will come out. But once it comes out publicly, that's a fully amended ready to go S-1? So we could see kind of the end game?
Moray P. Dewhurst: No, we've said that we filed on -- the confidential version on April 4. So now we're in the review process. Obviously, it depends upon the degree of the SEC's review and the comments that come from that and our responses to that, so it's a variable time. But at some point, we will be -- we hope through with that process and then the filing will become public.
Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC: But it is the only public once we're at a final version that will actually be used on the transaction or --
James L. Robo: Steve, this is Jim. If it does become public ultimately and market conditions are there and we move forward, all versions of -- the first S-1 that we filed and then the final S-1 that gets filed will all be available and public, so everything will be available.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs.
Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: First on FPL, just want to make sure I understand on the regulatory ROE. You're basically assuming that you're not going to take any during the course of 2014 because what you took in the first quarter you'll just reverse out gradually during the rest of the year?
Moray P. Dewhurst: That's correct, broadly speaking. Depends what the summer weather is.
Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Totally understood. Second, what's your latest thought about timing of next rate case?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Well, first of all, just to remind everybody, the current rate agreement goes through the end of 2016. Clearly, we are aiming strategically to put ourselves in a position for whatever comes beyond that, whether it's a formal rate case or whether it's another rate agreement to continue to track record of delivering value to the customers. In that vein, I would simply blend out that project momentum is a very important part of our ability to be in a good position come the end of '16 to continue to offer both customers and shareholders a very attractive value proposition. Beyond that, it's still only the early part of 2014.
Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Understood. I was just trying to think of the longer-term scenario of -- do you have to file or can you, if you manage your costs really well and you get a little bit of demand recovery, can you stay out of potential rate proceeding for beyond 2016 or so?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Yes, I think it's premature to speculate on the specifics of that, but certainly we are doing everything we can to put ourselves in a position to go for as long as we can without filing a rate case.
Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Got it, understood. And finally on the near side, again, I want to make sure, can you walk through just the amount of the megawatts of U.S. wind and U.S. solar, you expect to come online? Meaning not the stuff that's already online or COD, but that you expect to come online in both 2014 and '15. You made some comments in the prepared remarks about specific amounts in 2014. I just want to make sure we're understanding what's coming when.
Moray P. Dewhurst: Okay. At the risk of -- well, in order not to confuse you, I'm going to point you to Slide 11. I think that has the basic information, as well as Slide 25 has the details of individual projects that go into each of the buckets in Slide 11, so I think the information is there.
Operator: And we'll go now to Angie Storozynski from Macquarie.
Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research: So I wanted to actually follow-up on the regulatory plans for FPL and from 2 aspects. One is recent polls in Florida are suggesting that the former Governor, John Kristoff, is -- could be coming back, and how should we think about it of its potential impact on your regulatory affairs in Florida? Secondly on FPL, could you give us an update on the upgrades to your gas peakers? And thirdly, are you seeing any increased interest in potentially contracting new renewable projects from regulated utilities as they anticipate the new carbon emission rule from the EPA?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Angie, on the first, I would just say that we have operated very effectively through many different political and regulatory environments, and we are simply focused on doing the best job we can to deliver value for our customers. We think that's the best strategy for putting ourselves in the best position in the regulatory environment. On the peakers, we're in the midst of an in the field testing program where we are monitoring the actual emissions. We don't know exactly how that -- how long that will take, but should certainly be completed by the end of the summer. Based on that, we will then have a better sense of how we move forward. I think it's likely to be something along the same lines as we had outlined before, although it may not require as much capital as we had originally anticipated. And I would think that we would still be looking at the bulk of that activity being in the 2016 time frame. On the -- you're going to have to remind me what your third question was.
Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research: Yes, I was asking about utilities being more receptible to or willing to sign PPAs for renewable project in anticipation of the carbon rule from the EPA, basically attempting to offset the carbon emissions with some more renewables and the -- either in their portfolio or under PPAs?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Okay. I understand. Yes, I haven't heard of that being a motivator. I think the motivations are otherwise. But, Armando, you want to comment?
Armando Pimentel: Yes, let me give just a brief update of wind development. Moray mentioned this before. Clearly with the PTC extension out there and discussion on the PTC, there's a bit of uncertainty with customers, whether they're going to sign PPA contracts in 2015 or try to push it out. But I think that uncertainty will be cleared up really by the end of the year when we understand what's going on, on that front. We have a very large and active pipeline, potential opportunities at this point. We've talked about that pipeline before over the last year, both in the U.S. and Canada. And a fair number of the PPAs that we've actually signed in the last 18 to 24 months have actually not been driven by renewable portfolio standards in the states, have not been driven by EPA concerns, have actually been driven just by the pure economics of the long-term wind contracts. I think it's still a bit early to understand what some of the EPA rules might mean for us and beyond 2015, but it certainly can't be a negative, and I would expect it to be a positive. And, I guess, the last comment I would make is because we are getting towards the end of the PTC extension, which because of IRS guidelines essentially expires at the end of 2015, there are several acquisition opportunities in the market that we and others are looking at.
Operator: And we will take our last question today from Jonathan Arnold from Deutsche Bank.
Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: You sent an update on your latest thoughts on the plans around potential utility investment in the upstream nat gas business, anything you can share on that?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Not a lot new that we can share at the moment. Just to remind folks, we continue to pursue the potential opportunity to help the FPL customer by reducing the potential volatility of the fuel component of the bill and possibly lower its average cost over time by investing directly in gas reserves. We need to find the right set of deals that will make that a reality. We are in the midst of pursuing that, and I would certainly hope we will be in a position to come forward with something specific within the next 12 months. But that's -- I've said that before, there's really nothing new there.
Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: So we shouldn't be necessarily expecting sort of first, sort of trial in this calendar year, it's more of 12 month?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Yes, not necessarily.
Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: It could be as soon as this year, Moray?
Moray P. Dewhurst: It could be as soon as this year, but we'll have to see. The only other thing to say is that anything we do to start with will be fairly small, it won't have a huge impact. Obviously, we want to establish a framework and show that these kinds of things can be a good deal before we start to scale up.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference, and we thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day, everyone. Welcome to the NextEra Energy Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Julie Holmes. Please go ahead.
Julie Holmes: Thank you, Dana. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2013 earnings conference call. With me this morning are Jim Robo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; Moray Dewhurst, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; Armando Pimentel, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources; and Eric Silagy, President of Florida Power & Light Company. Moray will provide an overview of our results, and our executive team will then be available to answer your questions. We will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call in the risk factors section of the accompanying presentation or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website, nexteraenergy.com. We do not undertake any duties to update any forward-looking statements. Today's presentation also includes references to adjusted earnings which are non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of the non-GAAP measure to the closest GAAP financial measure. With that, I will turn the call over to Moray.
Moray P. Dewhurst: Thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy delivered strong financial results in 2013 while continuing to execute on the objectives we shared with you at our investor conference in March. At FPL, we continue to execute on our large construction projects, focused on productivity and cost effectiveness and identified and made substantial progress on our incremental capital investment opportunities. Achieving these objectives will help us to continue to deliver the best customer value in the state and one of the best in the nation. Also at FPL, the Florida Public Service Commission gave its approval for the natural gas transportation capacity contracts that will provide a commercial basis for a new third pipeline into the state, which ultimately will benefit all Floridians. This is an essential first step to enable Sabal Trail Transmission and Florida Southeast Connection pipeline projects to move towards construction. At Energy Resources, we continue to execute on our backlog in U.S. and Canadian wind projects and met our milestones for the development of our U.S. solar portfolio. We also remain focused on further developing our U.S. wind portfolio and securing incremental solar opportunities. In our Transmission business, we commissioned the Lone Star Transmission line during the first quarter on time and under budget. As we discussed last quarter, we were awarded development rights by the Ontario Energy Board to develop the East-West Tie Line Transmission Project with our partners Enbridge and Borealis, and we continue to pursue a number of other transmission opportunities in North America. Overall, 2013 was a very strong year that positions us well for 2014 and beyond. At FPL, our strategy is founded on offering the best customer value in the state and on finding ways to improve our value delivery over time. Consistent with our strategy, we continue to deploy capital that improves productivity and leads to cost savings that will benefit our customers and help keep rates low for the long term. In 2013, we invested approximately $2.9 billion at FPL, with approximately $700 million of this associated with our pre-modernizations. Our Cape Canaveral modernization entered service in April ahead of schedule and more than $100 million under budget. The Riviera Beach modernization is on budget and slightly ahead of schedule, and we expect this new efficient plant to enter service in the second quarter. We continue to expect to bring a modernized Port Everglades plant into service in mid-2016. As a reminder, FPL settlement agreement provides the base rate increases to recover the capital and operating costs in the modernizations at Cape Canaveral, Riviera Beach and Port Everglades as the plants enter service. Together, we estimate that the 3 modernized plants will provide customer benefits and more than $1 billion over their operational lifetimes. Early in the year, we successfully completed the extended power upgrades at our 4 nuclear units which added more than 500 megawatts of clean emissions free energy to our fleet. We also completed the installation of approximately 4.5 million smart meters in our service territory, which is part of our Energy Smart Florida program and began to realize benefits from the more reliable and efficient infrastructure that the program helps enable. Our day-to-day system reliability remains in the top quartile nationwide, and our customer satisfaction scores increased in 2013. At Energy Resources, we continue to execute on our backlog and pursue additional contracted renewable development opportunities. As we noted during the fourth quarter earnings call last year, we anticipated 2013 would be a down year for new wind installations compared to our record year in 2012, but we remain encouraged as we move into 2014 and 2015. In addition to the 1,175 megawatts of new wind projects that we had previously announced, we signed contracts of 250 megawatts of projects since our last earnings call, bringing our total U.S. wind development program for 2013 through 2015 to 1,425 megawatts. Of this total, we commissioned 250 megawatts during 2013 all in the fourth quarter. Based on everything we see at the moment, we believe our total of 2013 to 2015 U.S. wind program could be 2,000 to 2,500 megawatts. In Canada, we brought roughly 125 megawatts into service during 2013 and expect the remaining 466 megawatts in our backlog to enter service by the end of 2015, with the majority expected to come into service in 2014. You may recall that as of the March investor conference last year, our backlog of contracted U.S. solar projects consisted of roughly 800 megawatts. Of that backlog, both Genesis and Desert Sunlight were partially commissioned during the fourth quarter with 280 megawatts entering service between the 2 projects. We also completed our 20-megawatt Mountain View project earlier this month. The remaining 245 megawatts in Genesis and Desert Sunlight are expected to enter service in 2014, and our 250 megawatts McCoy project is progressing on schedule and is expected to come into service in 2015 and 2016. We had a successful year meeting our objectives for new U.S. solar development and signed contracts for 290 megawatts of projects, which are expected to come into service by the end of 2016. The balance of our contracted U.S. solar backlog is now 785 megawatts. Let me now walk through our results for the quarter and the full year. We will begin with results at FPL and then discuss Energy Resources and the consolidated numbers. For the fourth quarter of 2013, FPL reported net income of $248 million or $0.57 per share, down $0.04 per share year-over-year. For the full year, FPL reported net income of $1.35 billion or $3.16 per share, up $0.20 per share versus 2012. As a reminder, our results include the transition costs associated with Project Momentum that I spoke about last quarter. This includes the negative impact of roughly $0.03 in the quarter and approximately $0.07 for the full year. 2013 marked another year of continued investment in infrastructure projects, which helped improve our overall customer value proposition and was also the largest driver of our growth in contribution to earnings per share. We saw a decline in clause contribution to earnings per share as the completed nuclear upgrade projects were moved from clause to base rates with only a minor impact on net income. As I noted earlier, FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $2.9 billion. And as a result, our regulatory capital employed grew 10.4% year-over-year, and this translated to net income growth of 8.8%. Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes was 10.96%. This includes the impact of the Project Momentum transition costs. Absent these costs, regulatory ROE for the year would have been 11.25%. As we noted last quarter, under the current rate agreement, we record reserved amortization entries to achieve a predetermined regulatory ROE for each period, in this case, the 11.25% that I just mentioned, excluding special charges, such as the Project Momentum transition costs. During the quarter, we reversed $54 million of reserve amortization recorded earlier in the year in order to achieve this predetermined ROE. For the full year, we amortized $155 million and have roughly $245 million remaining. This leaves us in a slightly better position than we had anticipated at the beginning of the year. You will recall that we had always expected 2013 to require the use of more reserve amortization than any of the remaining years of the agreement. The Florida economy continues to strengthen and most of the indicators we track are improving. Florida's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in December was 6.2%, which was down once again versus the prior month, down 1.7 percentage points since December 2012 and down 5.2 percentage points from the all-time high of 11.4% at nearly 4 years ago. This is now the state's lowest unemployment rate since June 2008. The number of jobs in Florida was up 192,000 compared to a year earlier, and December was the 41st consecutive month with positive job growth in Florida following more than 3 years of job losses. Florida's private sector continues to drive the state's job growth, and more than 462,000 private sector jobs have been added since December 2010. The housing market in Florida also continues to show signs of resiliency. Housing permits in Florida jumped 25% over last November versus a U.S. gain of 8%, and mortgage delinquency rates and the inventory of existing homes in Florida continue to decline. The Case-Shiller Index for South Florida shows home prices up 16% from the prior year. Other data released in 2013 suggest that Florida once again has a very attractive business climate compared to many other states. The U.S. Census Bureau now estimates that Florida's population increased by more than 230,000 people over the 12-month period that ended July 1 of last year, and many analysts now project that Florida will pass New York as America's third largest state sometime in 2014. Overall, Florida's economy is progressing well and is poised for further growth. As we discussed throughout the year, we continue to see our customer metrics at FPL improve moderately. Underlying usage per customer increased 1.0% compared to the same quarter last year. For the full year, underlying usage per customer grew 0.4% compared to 2012. We expect long-term usage growth of approximately 0.5% net of the impacted efficiency and conservation programs through the period of the rate agreement. Another encouraging development during the quarter was a decrease in the percentage of low usage customers, the 12-month average of the low-usage percentage has fallen to 8.2%, its lowest level since December 2007. The number of inactive accounts has also continued to decline, reaching its lowest level since 2005. During the fourth quarter, we also saw the largest increase in customers since late 2007, with approximately 80,000 more customers than in the comparable quarter of 2012, representing an increase of 1.7%. While this is clearly positive, roughly half of the increase can be attributable to the roll out of our remote connect and disconnect capability enabled by our smart meter program that we highlighted on our third quarter call. These new customers, which are disproportionately low-usage and residential, have a lower impact on our sales. We estimate that customer growth accounted for about 0.8% increase in sales in the fourth quarter and 0.6% for the full year. Overall, we are seeing continued improvement in our customer data, and we continue to believe that Florida will experience above-average growth over the long term. Turning to our incremental development efforts. We have several updates to share regarding our progress. FPL's storm hardening plan was approved by the Florida Public Service Commission in November, and the incremental reliability investments we are making to strengthen the system remain on track. Excluding our major generation capital projects, we plan to invest approximately $7.8 billion to $8.3 billion over the 2013 to 2016 period in our hardening and reliability efforts, as well as all our other infrastructure investments. This also includes fuel for our 4 Florida nuclear units. During the quarter and following further discussion with the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, FPL withdrew its petition for the peaker upgrade project. We are currently working with the Florida Department of Environmental Protection to perform additional emissions monitoring to measure our existing peakers impact on local air quality. We expect to file a new petition and supporting testimony once we have a clearer idea of the scope of upgrades that will be required. The monitoring could extend up to 1 year, and while it is too early to comment on the scope or timing of the project, we believe the ultimate solution may require us to deploy less capital than we had originally anticipated. The Florida pipeline, which includes NextEra Energy's minority interest in the Sabal Trail Transmission joint venture and our wholly owned subsidiary, Florida Southeast Connection, continues to move through the regulatory process. The PSC's approval of the contract is now final. FERC approval is expected sometime in 2015, and construction is anticipated to be completed in mid-2017. Looking forward, financial results from the pipeline projects will be reported as part of our Corporate & Other business segment, and so in future earnings releases, we will discuss developments in the Corporate & Other section. Let me turn now to Energy Resources, which reported fourth quarter 2013 GAAP earnings of $85 million or $0.20 per share. Adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter were $173 million or $0.40 per share. Energy Resources contribution to adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter decreased $0.02 from last year, with greater contributions from new investments in gas infrastructure being slightly more than offset by corporate G&A and existing assets. All other effects were minor. For the full year 2013, Energy Resources reported GAAP earnings of $556 million or $1.30 per share. Adjusted earnings were $780 million or $1.83 per share, up $0.17 or 10% from the prior year. As we discussed on our fourth quarter 2012 call, we expected to see growth return in 2013 as some of the headwinds experienced in 2012 subsided and our new investments contributed meaningfully to earnings and so it proved. For the full year 2013, the $0.17 increase in adjusted EPS was driven by several factors. Contributions from our new investments added $0.31, with $0.04 coming from an increase in CITCs. We elected CITCs for roughly 280 megawatts of solar projects in 2013 compared to approximately 455 megawatts of wind projects in 2012. The greater capital cost of solar projects accounts for the increase from 2012 to 2013. Contribution from gas infrastructure increased $0.04 over the prior year, primarily as a result of additional production. These positives were offset by increased corporate G&A and other costs of $0.12, of which $0.03 for transition costs associated with Project Momentum. Lower contributions from existing investments in 2013 negatively affected the comparison to last year by $0.03. All other effects were minor. Looking forward, we expect to elect CITCs on roughly 265 megawatts of new solar generation in 2014. As we did last year, we have included a summary in the appendix of the presentation that compares our realized equivalent EBITDA to the ranges we provided in the third quarter of 2012. Generally speaking, we came in within the ranges we had anticipated. During the year, we placed approximately 375 megawatts of wind into service. We also reached production levels of nearly 30 million megawatt hours during 2013, the highest level in company history. We estimate that overall wind resource was a couple of points below the long-term average. Of the roughly 30 million megawatt hours of production, approximately 60% were eligible for PTCs. The remainder represents output from projects on which we had elected CITCs, projects that have passed their 10-year window of eligibility for PTCs or Canadian projects. Nearly 50% of the PTCs generated were allocated to investors under the differential membership interest of tax equity partnerships we have entered into that allow us to monetize the tax benefits from our renewables projects more efficiently. As shown on the accompanying slide, the percentage of PTCs allocated to investors grew in 2013, and we expect that proportion to continue to grow to between 55% and 60% in 2014, as we see the full year impact of our 2013 tax equity partnerships flow through. Looking at the company on a consolidated basis. For the fourth quarter of 2013, NextEra Energy's GAAP net income was $327 million or $0.75 per share. NextEra Energy's 2013 fourth quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $414 million and $0.95, respectively. For the full year 2013, the company's GAAP net income was $1.9 billion or $4.47 per share. Adjusted earnings were approximately $2.1 billion or $4.97 per share. The Corporate & Other segment improved slightly relative to 2012, as earnings from our Lone Star business increased, but were offset by residual interest in taxes. For the full year 2013, on an adjusted basis, the Corporate & Other segment was up $0.03 from 2012, driven by growth in the regulated transmission segment. In 2014, we expect annual contribution to earnings from this segment to improve modestly. 2013 marked another year of significant capital investment for both FPL and Energy Resources, exceeding our internally generated cash flows by about $1 billion. Our treasury team executed on approximately $7 billion worth of financing transactions across a wide range of capital sources, including refinancing and various capital optimization opportunities. These were designed to meet our capital needs, while also supporting our balance sheet and credit strength, which are central to our business strategies. In addition to a variety of conventional debt issuances, we continue to make use of project debt to support growth at Energy Resources and we also sold additional differential membership interests to efficiently utilize tax credits generated by new wind projects. We also issued $500 million of equity units to ensure we have the equity support needed during this transitional period of high capital expenditures. These will convert to straight common equity in 2016, at which time they will be integrated into our ongoing financing program. As we indicated on our third quarter earnings call, our equity needs are dependent on our success in firming up incremental investment opportunities that we outlined at our March investor conference. We expected to need to issue at least $1 billion in equity before the end of 2014 to achieve our target credit metrics. During the quarter, we entered into transactions to issue approximately $1 billion in equity. And when considering our current capital expenditure program, our target credit metrics remain on track. As a reminder, our growth in cash flow naturally picks up as our large construction projects enter service, so additional equity needs from hereon will primarily depend on whether or not we see additional incremental capital expenditures that affect 2014 meaningfully. In light of the progress made against our execution objectives, we continue to be comfortable with the 2014 adjusted EPS expectations we shared with you last spring at $5.05 to $5.45 per share. And for the longer-term outlook, we continue to see adjusted EPS growing at a compound annual growth rate of 5% to 7% through 2016 off a 2012 base. As always, our expectations are subject to the usual caveats we provide, including normal weather and operating conditions. In the appendix, we've provided a number of sensitivities around our 2014 expectations. We expect the majority of the adjusted EPS growth in 2014 to come in the second half of the year and the fourth quarter comparison should be particularly strong, given the impact of Project Momentum transition costs in the fourth quarter of 2013. While we have already begun to see significant benefits from Project Momentum, we expect these to continue to increase as we go through the year, making for stronger growth comparisons in the second half of the year. In addition, we expect the first quarter for Energy Resources to be challenged by the difficult market conditions we're seeing so far this year in the mid-Atlantic region caused by extremely cold weather and limitations on natural gas supply. This will likely have a negative impact on any business, including our full requirements portfolio in the Northeast with fixed price load obligations. While some elements of our portfolio have benefited from these conditions, we expect the full requirements business in the Northeast to underperform under these extreme conditions. For the full year 2014 at Energy Resources, we expect somewhat lower growth in adjusted earnings than we enjoyed in 2013. While we expect continued strong contributions from new contracted renewables projects, both solar and wind, we expect the existing portfolio will be down year-over-year as we have 4 nuclear refueling outages scheduled, as well as the ongoing impact of PTC roll-offs. In addition, we expect interest expense to be higher, not only because of a larger capital base but also because of the impact of higher rates. Finally, at FPL, growth in the wholesale segment should be an important driver of growth overall in 2014, but variability around wholesale load will consequently become a source of variability for FPL earnings as well. With regard to the longer-term outlook, we continue to see the 5% to 7% range through 2016 translating to an expected adjusted earnings per share range of $5.50 to $6 as reasonable. However, 2016 is still a long way off and many factors could change our expectations. Since the investor conference last March, we've seen many favorable developments, some of which have clearly moved our 2016 expectations up within the broad range we have outlined. On the other hand, we're also seeing some negative developments, such as rising interest rates, which must temper our expectations. And many of the projects on which we have made progress will drive earnings in 2017 and beyond more than 2016. Overall, we continue to believe the $5.50 to $6 range is reasonable given all the data we have at the moment, and we are working hard to ensure we are as high as possible within that range. Over the past months, we have continued our evaluation of ways to efficiently recycle capital invested in Energy Resources projects, including so-called yieldco structures. While we are not yet at a point of making a decision, we can share with you a few thoughts. Many of you who have volunteered your thoughts on the impact that forming a yieldco might have on NextEra, and we thank you for your input which we consider seriously. We've also explored further a range of possible private transactions, including structures analogous to a public yieldco. As a result, there are 5 general points which we can emphasize. First, we are committed to the general policy of recycling capital, both to promote efficient capital utilization and to maintain an appropriate portfolio balance. We expect to concentrate on deploying capital where we believe we have the potential to create value, typically, though not necessarily, in the earliest stages of project development and operations. And we expect to reduce capital investment in areas where we believe we have optimized project structure and operations and/or where others may have lower capital costs. Typically, though not necessarily, projects that are more mature in their operations and life cycle position. Second, in executing this policy of recycling capital, we will continue to be opportunistic, trying to find what we believe are the best structure and the best markets for each situation as it emerges. Even if we pursue a more general structure such as a yieldco, we expect there will continue to be individual transactions outside this framework, such as individual or small portfolio sales to specific investors, as well as project financings and tax equity partnerships. Third, our continuing assessment over the past few weeks suggest to us that the public form of yieldco has some clear advantages over the private forms we have also been considering. In particular, we have come to believe that valuation levels are likely to be lower for the private format, at least in today's economic environment, and that there is less likelihood that those valuation levels will be reflected back on the stock of sponsor, the so-called readthrough effect. Of course, these are our considered judgments for there is no analytical way to be sure and there could be no guarantee that we are right. Based on these and other considerations, however, we think it is unlikely that we will pursue a private version. Fourth, as we have previously said, our focus is on sustained value creation for our shareholders. The mere fact that public yieldco vehicles may trade well in today's environment is not in itself a sufficient argument to go forward with one. We recognize that the question of value creation is ultimately one of judgment, but we want to be sure that when we reach a judgment, it is based on a best information available. Fifth, as we have also previously stated, were we to pursue a public yieldco, we would want to be sure that it was structured so it not negatively to impact our corporate credit position, which we continue to view as an important element in our competitive strategy at Energy Resources. Again, however, I need to emphasize that we have made no decision one way or the other. We continue to examine a wide range of practical issues, including structuring, tax, governance, portfolio composition, interaction with existing financing arrangements and ongoing reporting and compliance issues. Finally, while we will continue to take a deliberate approach to resolving the questions we have and reaching a considered judgment, we hope to be in a position to give you a clearer assessment before the end of the second quarter. Before taking your questions, let me conclude with a summary of our key areas of focus for 2014. At FPL, our focus will continue to be on excellence in execution. We will strive to deliver the best value in the state to our customers and we will continue with the execution of our major capital initiatives, including the 2 remaining modernizations, our storm hardening program and our system reliability initiatives. We will also seek to finalize our determination of the upgrades that will be needed for our peaking facilities to meet future environmental standards. Supporting our strategy at FPL, we will be pursuing the successful development of the Florida Southeast Connection and Sabal Trail pipeline projects, with emphasis on being in a position for timely receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals. At Energy Resources, we will continue to focus on excellence in day-to-day operations and we will continue to advance the development of our industry-leading portfolio of contracted renewables projects. In particular, we will be looking to extend our strong backlog of projects into 2015 and beyond. And at NextEra Energy Transmission, we will be focused on reliable operations and successful development of new project opportunities. Across all our businesses, we will have a special focus on implementing the many initiatives that emerged from Project Momentum, a competitively strong cost position continues to be an underpinning of our strategies across all businesses. At the Corporate level, we will seek to finance our activities in a way that supports our strong credit position and ensures that our credit metrics continue to improve on the part we have laid out for you. And with that, we will now open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Dan Eggers at Crédit Suisse.
Dan Eggers - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Before we get run over on the yieldco conversation, I guess if you could just talk a little bit about the wind portfolio and the difference between expected generation additions and what you have under contract, and when do you think those 2 numbers merge into a final decided number for '14, '15?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Well, if we go back to the investor conference last year. That time, we were talking about expectations for U.S. wind program for 2013 and 2014 with a range of 500 to 1,500. So what's happened since then really is, in particular with the IRS clarification of some of the language around eligibility for that PTC, we can clearly see a path to extend that program from 2013, 2014 to 2013 through 2015. So based on that and what we're seeing in the marketplace, we've revised upwards our view of the total portfolio opportunities, so that's the 2,000 to 2,500. And as you can see from the numbers, we're close to 1,500 already in the backlog, so that means we see the potential for another 500 to 1,000 of projects that could be contracted from here on. The timing of that will play out over the course of the year since, at this point, we're really thinking of it as a program through 2015. Anything that's going to come in service before the end of 2015, we really are going to have to have the contracting piece wrapped up by close to the end of this year. So we should know a lot more about where we are by the end of this year.
Dan Eggers - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: And I guess just kind of on the yieldco, thanks for giving more detail on the thought process. But when you look at some of the decision points you have setting out there, what do you need to get comfortable with the impact on the credit ratings for the corporate? Is that an agency's conversation and a modeling conversation on your side? And then I guess, when you think about sustained value creation in a public equity, what do you need to see to get comfortable whether that's a durable opportunity or not?
Moray P. Dewhurst: All right. Well, I guess, first, I just kind of repeat the list in the prepared remarks. I mean, we're still working through a lot of the practical issues, structuring, tax, governance, composition of portfolio, all of those kinds of things. Certainly, the credit impact is very important to us. That's a function both of modeling and obviously of conversations and feedback with the agencies. I'm sure many of you are aware that Moody's put out a general piece on the subject of yieldco, which essentially says that the impact on credit depends, and so we want to push further to make sure we understand exactly what that dependence looks like, so it's going to be a variety of things like that. On the question of the sustained value creation, again, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, ultimately, that comes down to a judgment call. I think we clearly have some evidence just through the passage of time that helps provide us some input on that. But that's just something that we're going to have to reach a point of comfort with on a judgmental basis, and we're not at that point yet.
Dan Eggers - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: And I guess the last one. As you guys think about NextEra as a whole, how comfortable is the board with the idea of perspectively changing the rate of growth for the consolidated company from 5% to 7% to something else if you were to allocate more growth to the yieldco design?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Well, I think that, that really, the answer to that has really subsumed in the overall question of, is there a value creation opportunity for NextEra Energy shareholders if the trade up in growth that you're talking about ultimately run the results in greater value for our shareholders, and I think that's clearly a very positive factor.
Operator: We'll go next to Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.
Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: I wondered if you could just talk broadly about renewable economics that you're seeing in terms of improvements in the technology kind of the PPA levels in general that you're seeing. If you could just talk sort of holistically about the competitive dynamic for renewables as you're seeing, do you see the technology improvements helping to extend that market? How are the competitive dynamics out there?
Moray P. Dewhurst: A couple of general comments, and I'll ask Armando to expand. But just as a reminder for folks, we've seen very substantial improvements in wind economics driven by technology, larger machines, taller towers, longer blades, to the point where, as I think most people know, in a strong wind regime, it's possible to sign a long-term PPA with prices in with a 2 panels on them and still get acceptable returns. So in many parts of the country today, including the impact of the PTC, wind is the most economic form of new energy generation. We've also seen significant improvement on the solar side to PV with panel prices coming down, but solar is a much more limited market focused on primarily the Desert Southwest and a few other areas. So that's been the general trend. Relative to that general trend, I wouldn't say that in the last 6 to 9 months, there's been any major departure. But let me ask Armando now to comment on how that's playing out in market dynamics.
Armando Pimentel: Yes, I'd agree obviously with all of that. The couple points I would add is, interestingly enough, I think we've talked about this before, in some areas of the country, we are seeing where solar is crowding out wind. The economics of solar have clearly improved across the board. It's not just the overall cost of the panel or the balance of the plant, but it's also small changes in efficiency. So although wind economics have clearly improved in some areas of the countries, primarily the west and the southwest, it's clear that solar is a better alternative. That's the first point I'd make. The second point I'd make is, a couple of years ago, we've talked about seeing more RFPs on the solar side, which we thought was a clear positive. We continue to see that. We continue to see that even in states that don't have requirements -- renewable portfolio standards for solar. So we were encouraged by that. We're seeing them all the way up through the Canada border and all the way down to Mexico. So I think that's a real positive for solar that we will continue to see.
Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Well, that's helpful. Then just as a follow-up on the yieldco. For a public option, I know one of your objectives has been to think about aligning incentives, ensuring that there is an alignment there. When you think about aligning incentives, would -- an approach where there are incentive payments along the lines what we see in the world of MLPs be something that could be a tool to achieve that?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Potentially, that's certainly a whole area that we're looking at and we think it's important, that there be as close an alignment of interests as possible.
Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. So incentive payments in general, that's an area that you're focused on and thinking about that?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Yes. We're certainly studying how that has worked out in the MLP space, is there a way of incorporating some of those elements into different structures, all of those kinds of things, yes.
Operator: And we'll go next to Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: So first -- hitting the yieldco first off. What is it about end of second quarter? Is there something you're waiting for in particular? I just wanted to get a little bit more of a sense as to data points you might be looking for the market to get -- to make this decision? And when it comes to valuation discrepancy that you commented on of late, is it something that you see in the public market or is it something in the private market that is really driving the discrepancy in the valuations in your mind? Just to make it a little clearer.
Moray P. Dewhurst: The answer to the second question is really based on the market feedback that we've been observing on both sides over the last few months. So again, I want to stress that that's a judgment call because, obviously, unless you went out with a particular structure hypothetically in two parallel universes, 1 public and 1 private, you'll never really know. But that's what we are seeing based on our reading of the market data. On the bigger question of the timing, I appreciate that we are being frustrating to a number of folks out there, there's no one particular thing in the outside world that I can point you to like this is more a function of the ongoing process that we are working through. I think I've mentioned to a number of folks that I've met with over the past 6 months, that it seems like every session we have with our team internally, they answer a series of questions that we have and that turns to [ph] more questions. So we're continuing to work methodically through questions, but I do think that we will be in a position to give you an update by the end of the second quarter.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Great. And then looking at the supply business, obviously, you tweaked '14 expectations. How do you think about that in '15 onwards? Is this kind of a one-time impact from the first quarter's event or should we kind of structurally think about revising expectations from that segment?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Well, we're going to have to see. We'll just have to see how the quarter actually plays out. I mean, there's a big difference between what's happening or what's been happening in NEPOOL versus what's been happening in PJM, obviously. And so, in part, what the future looks like depends upon how rapidly the gas transportation constraints open up in different parts of that region. So clearly, the dynamics of the business and the pricing of that business are going to change going forward, but we'll have to see. We're certainly not going to change our return expectations for that business, so we will definitely expect to see higher pricing in the future.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Got you. And then just turning to the utility real quickly. You've talked a little bit in the past about opportunities to add E&P assets potentially within the portfolio to lock in pricing. Where are you with respect to that?
Moray P. Dewhurst: I would say that we are still in the very early days. And just as a background for everybody, after we worked through the opportunities to improve the efficiency of the generation fleet that made a huge impact on our fuel consumption and over the long term, reduces our expected fuel bill, which we passed through to the customer very substantially. What remains is still a substantial portion of the bill and it is subject to volatility, although we don't see gas prices going up to -- back up to the 2007 levels, there's clearly volatility in there. So it certainly seems to us that anything that we could do that would help lower long-term costs of that component and in particular, to reduce its volatility, will be highly valuable to our customers. So that's really the motivation for thinking about E&P reserves. So we're still in the very early stages. It's important to recognize that FPL is a very, very large consumer of natural gas. And so to have a meaningful impact that's beneficial, that the customer can really see. You've got to do a lot and we're probably not going to do anything on a large scale initially. So if we do proceed down that part, anything we do, we will start on a small scale, but I don't have any particular time frame in mind on that.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: And then just quickly, lastly, in terms of the competitive dynamic with other yieldcos out there now, are you seeing more of a cost of capital compression in some of the PPAs up there? What's the dynamic, if you will?
Moray P. Dewhurst: No, we certainly haven't seen that so far that -- maybe that's a longer-term trend. But it certainly hasn't been the case so far.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research.
Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC: Could you give us a data point on what the current PTC-eligible project number ended up coming in at the end of the year in terms of meeting that 5%?
Moray P. Dewhurst: I'm not sure I'm following your question, Steve. Could you...
Dan Eggers - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: The kind of amount of potential assets that will be able to get the PTC that expired meeting that kind of 5% threshold?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Okay, I get where you're going. Yes, it's significantly larger than the upper end of what we believe is reasonable given actual market conditions. So we're not going to be constrained by the safe harboring issue.
Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC: Okay. I guess my other question, and I apologize to beat on the yieldco, but in terms of the kind of credit analysis you're doing, could you just give us some sense of what you've heard or what the rating agencies have already said on the structure and potential impact on corporate credit?
Moray P. Dewhurst: I think at this stage, Steve, I'm sorry to say, that's been -- really, the only thing I can say is, the answer is, it depends. So we're not far enough along to know what the final structure or mix would be to make sure that it's still not negative to credit.
Operator: Now we'll go next to Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.
Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Guys, two questions. One on the boring side. Just looking at the quarter and even at the year at O&M at both NEER and at the Corporate level, big year-over-year uptick, so I assume NEER is tied to new projects. But just any comments you may have to add onto that.
Moray P. Dewhurst: I'm sorry, on the FPL side, O&M actually was down year-on-year.
Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Right, NEER and Corporate.
Moray P. Dewhurst: I'm sorry, NEER and Corporate, okay. On the NEER side, it's really growth of the business. We did put a little more into development expenditures, particularly late in the year. But there's nothing unusual going on there. It's fundamentally growth in the business. It's actually less than we expected it to be at the beginning of the year because we started to see some early benefits from Project Momentum.
Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then a solar-related question. You made a number of comments about the economics, you and Armando, about the economics of solar relative to the economics of wind. Is there any interest in NextEra in terms of the rooftop solar business? If so, what are the economics like when you look at it? How would you actually enter that business if you were to decide to do so?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Well, the short answer is yes, there's an interest, but let me be a little more clear when we say rooftop. That covers a wide range of territory. Sometime last year, possibly in 2012, we authorized the team to go ahead and do some basic exploration of the, I'll call it, the distributed solar space. The conclusion they came back with was that we don't see, at least at this time, an economic opportunity in the residential end of that space, which is often what people think of when they say rooftop. We do think there may be some opportunities in the C&I space. As you get towards particularly the largest C&I customers, those projects often tend to look not that different from a small utility scale project. So we are currently exploring that area, we acquired a small company that was already in that business and we have a little backlog of projects. But at this stage, I would say, that's definitely in the category of a toe in the water and we have to see how that goes. There's really -- at least at this stage, there's only useful markets for that in areas where rates are high. In Florida, we have a very low rate structures, so it's not such an economic incentive.
Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And finally, on the supply, the customer supply business or the retail supply business at NEER, how should we think about the worst-case scenario? I mean, we're expecting another couple of days of crazy weather here in the northeast. We've had heat rates blow out, we've had local gas prices at various northeastern gas hubs completely blow out. You've had, in prior quarters, going back to issues in Texas a year or so ago, and we've seen other companies like Reliant back in 2008 have some issues on the supply side in terms of just being caught short megawatt hours. How should investors think about what kind of the bare case outcome would that be for that business for you?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Well, first of all, just to say, inherent in that business, it obviously has a left tail, so when you have extreme conditions of high load and high prices, any portfolio like that is always going to underperform. How bad could it be, well, obviously, it depends upon how many days of extreme conditions you build into your anticipation. I think we'd been reasonably conservative in what we've -- what we're looking at so far. I don't think it's going to end up having a material impact on the year overall, but it's clearly going to weigh in on the first quarter.
Operator: We'll go next to Shar Pourreza with Citi.
Shahriar Pourreza - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: As you think about growing solar and emphasizing that part of the business more, can you maybe comment on any potential impediments or bottlenecks to the tax equity markets? Are you seeing any bottlenecks? Or a little bit of color there would be great.
Moray P. Dewhurst: On the tax equity market, I guess I would say that there is really about the same amount of capacity now than they have been for the last couple of years. Not surprisingly, we think that rates in that market are way too high and they really should come down very substantially. But there hasn't been a great deal of change the last couple of years. We also would certainly like it if there was more depth in the market. But the reality is, there's only a certain number of players. So it's perfectly adequate for the kind of scale of activity that we have and that we anticipate for the future. But like any other capital market, you'd always like that to be more depth and lower prices.
Shahriar Pourreza - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Got you. And just one quick follow-up. As you think about potential public yieldcos, can you maybe just give us a sense on how to think about recapturing of any of kind of an ITC or PTCs for qualified assets that could drop down into a yieldco?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Well, one of the sort of criteria for thinking about asset suitability for yieldco is really whether they are in the PTC generation phase, because the way the yieldco vehicle would typically be structured, it would not be able to take advantage of PTCs and therefore, you would be better off -- in general, this is a general statement, might not always be true, but in general, retaining those at the sponsor level and utilizing PTCs in another way at that level. So it's really a matter of which project becomes suitable for a yieldco.
Shahriar Pourreza - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay, got you. And then just lastly, as you think about doing a yieldco, how much of your decision-making on whether to move forward or not is predicated on whether you see any movement in the MLP parity act?
Moray P. Dewhurst: That's really an independent issue. The decision-making that we're going through is looking at the vehicle or potential vehicles as they might exist today with today's tax law.
Operator: We'll go next to Brian Chin with Merrill Lynch.
Brian Chin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Just a quick point of clarification. So you signaled that by the end of 2Q, you will have made your decision. Should we interpret that to mean that on the 2Q earnings call is when you'll announce something, or are you retaining the flexibility going out something earlier than that? Just a little bit extra clarification on the timing.
Moray P. Dewhurst: Well, to be clear, we're not saying we will have necessarily made a decision by the end of the second quarter, but we certainly expect to be in a much better position to give you our overall assessment. So by that, I mean, by the quarterly earnings call, could there be something beforehand if we arrive at a decision? Yes, I suppose that's possible. I just -- I'm certainly not going to commit to anything here.
Operator: We'll go next to Hugh Wynne with Sanford Bernstein.
Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Moray, I think in your conference on -- your investor conference in March, you forewarned us that NextEra could become a much more robust cash generator in the years ahead depending on the level of capital outlays. And looking at your cash flow statement for the year, that certainly seems have been the case. Now I was hoping I might get you to talk about some of the largest drivers of the changes on the cash flow statement. So for example, I'd say that cash from operations is up by over $1 billion or 25% largely on a $1 billion increase in depreciation and amortization and deferred income taxes, both of which were up by 50%. Then on the other hand, your CapEx or cash used in investment is down by almost $3 billion, which is a decline of 30%, with a net effect that your cash used in financing activities has reduced your borrowing requirement by about $3.8 billion or 75%. So those are dramatic changes, and I was just wondering if you might kind of take us through the highlights.
Moray P. Dewhurst: Sure. I guess I'll just go back to some of the things that I'm sure people have forgotten, but we've talked about in the March investor conference last year. On the growth in the operating cash flow, first, let's focus on FPL. We knew that we were entering a new rate agreement in 2013, and one of the key benefits of that was the reduction in the amount of surplus depreciation that we were going to need, really, the completion of noncash earnings into cash. So with the initial base revenue increase and then the subsequent GBRA rate increases, we're now getting real cash returns that are commensurate with the regulatory returns. Not exactly equal but commensurate. So we knew that, that was going to drive significant growth on the FPL side. On the Energy Resources side, we had -- in 2012, we had just completed the 1,500 megawatts of U.S. wind, and so we knew that, that was going to come into service and driving cash flow on that side. So those -- and that continues going forward. As the big new projects at Energy Resources come into service out of that construction phase, they start to contribute to the growth in the operating cash flow. On the CapEx side, we knew that 2012 was going to be a peak year for CapEx. We were right at the peak of the spending on the FPL side with the nuclear upgrades, modernizations and ongoing infrastructure spending. And of course, we had not only 1,500 megawatts of U.S. wind but spending on solar projects, which were not yet anywhere near coming into service, all of that concentrated in 2012. So 2013, so that start to come down to hopefully more normal levels. So those were both the principal dynamics that we have tried to focus people on last year. And I'll just say, they came in very much where we expect it. So we're pretty much about where we expected to be on the operating cash flow, pretty much where we expect it to be on the CapEx with one exception, which is we have ended up accelerating, on the Energy Resources side, some of the capital spending. We had some opportunities to negotiate some improved pricing on some equipment, which led us to accelerating some capital spending and also because the development program has gone well. So those are the main 2 dynamics. And then, as you noted, that produces a huge swing in the free cash flow. Of course, we also did the equity -- both the equity unit, but more importantly, the $1 billion equity transaction, the combination of $400 million of straight common and the $600 million of forward late last year, so that contributed significantly, too. But it's a pretty dramatic swing, and it's reflected obviously in the credit metrics from 2013 and we expect to see, not to the same extent, but a continuation of same general trends in 2014.
Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Excellent. That was just what I was hoping for. Just one quick follow-up question. Your decision to reverse a portion of the depreciation and amortization that you had taken in '13 and the fourth quarter, does that stem primarily from more rapid than expected growth in volume sales, or what was the driver of that decision?
Moray P. Dewhurst: No. To be clear, just to reiterate, it's directly driven off the policies that's maintaining a target ROE, regulatory ROE. The indirect driver that you're getting at actually was that we made quicker progress on the O&M front coming out of Project Momentum than we had originally anticipated going into the year, so -- and that's why we end up with a little bit more, $245 million leftover at the end of the year. Well, I think, at the end of last year, we're anticipating we'd be somewhere around $200 million or $220 million.
Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Got it, great.
Moray P. Dewhurst: Yes, we're feeling very good about where we are on the cost side.
Operator: And we'll take our final question today from Greg Gordon with ISI Group.
Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Two quick questions. First, Moray, you talked about the impact of the weather in the Northeast on your load-serving business. When we -- once we get through the season and you assess where you're at, are we going see that show up, if I'm looking at the equivalent EBITDA ranges that you gave for the different buckets in the year, will we see the impact of that show up in customer supply, power and gas trading, or in the spark spread and other line for the 1,000 megawatts or so you have in the Northeast?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Well, it's going to be spread across those. Obviously, it's a complex situation. The fuel requirements we book is in the customer supply line, so that will be much lower than we had originally anticipated. Some of the physical assets up there, in spark spread and other, will probably look somewhat better. How much better will remain to be seen? We'll have to see how the pure marketing and trading line looks. But there are puts and takes even within that, so there a lot of complex effects. And some parts of the portfolio have done very well, but the full requirements were clearly underperformed, and that's relatively speaking for us quite big in the northeast compared with our asset positions.
Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Great. And then the last question, of course, is on yieldco. When you gave your 5 sort of key issues that you're grappling with, 1 of them was that you wanted to retain the flexibility because you need to be opportunistic to find the best way to monetize each sort of asset in your portfolio. How do you marry that up with or balance that with the necessity for having a certain amount of sort of visible manufactured growth in the yieldco to attract a low enough yield to make it low enough cost of capital to be attractive? In other words, you have to promise people growth, but then you're saying you want to be opportunistic in the way you place your assets?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Right. And that's clearly 1 of, what I call, the pragmatic issues that we have to work through. We've got to make sure that if we were to pursue the yieldco path, we don't end up inadvertently compromising the value of some particular assets, which might have greater value realization that dealt with in a different way.
Operator: And that does conclude today's presentation. We thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the NextEra Energy Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. And at this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Julie Holmes, Director of Investor Relations.
Julie Holmes: Thank you, Lisa. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter 2013 earnings conference call. Joining us this morning are Jim Robo, NextEra Energy President and Chief Executive Officer; Moray Dewhurst, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; Armando Pimentel, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources; and Eric Silangy, President of Florida Power & Light. Moray will provide an overview of our results during the quarter and our executive team will then be available to answer your questions. We will be making statements during this call that are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release, in the comments made during this conference call, in the risk factors section of the accompanying presentation or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website, nexteraenergy.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. Please also note that today's presentation includes references to adjusted earnings, which are non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying this presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of the non-GAAP measure to the closest GAAP financial measure. With that, I will turn the call over to Moray.
Moray P. Dewhurst: Thank you, Julie, good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy delivered a strong third quarter results and continued to make progress on the initiatives laid out in the March investor conference. Our earnings growth in the quarter was driven primarily by continued investment at FPL and the addition of new contracted renewables projects at Energy Resources. With 3 quarters of good performance behind us, we are well-positioned to close up a year above the midpoint of the range of adjusted EPS expectations that we shared with you in January subject to our usual caveats. At the same time, we continued to execute on our existing backlog of development and construction projects and we have made further progress in firming up some of our incremental investment opportunities. At FPL, net income growth was driven by investment in projects that are designed to further improve an already strong customer value proposition. We remain very focused on execution and all of our major capital projects are on track with the Riviera Beach and Port Everglades modernizations, both running on time and on budget. We have filed for the necessary regulatory approvals for the new gas pipeline and the peaker upgrade project and we have made good progress in defining apart towards our goal of keeping nonfuel O&M to roughly flat in nominal terms through the period of the current rate agreement. At Energy Resources, adjusted earnings growth was driven primarily by new investment in our contracted renewables project. In the third quarter, we brought into service roughly 125 megawatts of wind in Canada but is contracted under the Ontario feed-in tariff program. We continue to execute on our backlog of approximately 800 megawatts of contracted U.S. solar projects, of which about 300 megawatts are expected into come into service in 2013, with the balance expected to come into service by the end of 2016. We have also been successful in adding to our pipeline of contracted renewables development opportunities and I will provide some additional details later in the call. During the quarter, we move forward with our company-wide initiative to improve productivity, which we refer to as Project Momentum. After careful evaluation, we have identified and are moving ahead with a number of ideas that we expect to yield in total somewhere between $200 million and $250 million in annual cost savings. The transition cost associated with this initiative negatively impacted adjusted earnings in the third quarter by $0.05 and we expect the full year impact to be roughly $0.09 or $0.10. We will provide more detail on the impact of both FPL and Energy Resources when we walk through their quarterly results. With the progress we've made year-to-date, we continue to see a long-term adjusted earnings per share of compounded annual growth rate of 5% to 7% through 2016 off the 2012 base. Our expectations are subject to the usual caveats we provide, including normal weather and operating conditions. Let me now walk through our results for the third quarter of 2013. I'll begin with the result of FPL before moving on to Energy Resources and then the consolidated numbers. For the third quarter of 2013, FPL reported net income of $422 million or $0.99 per share, up $0.06 per share year-over-year. As you evaluate the numbers, you may wish to keep in mind that they include the transition costs associated with Project Momentum that I spoke about a moment ago. This includes the negative impact of roughly $0.04 in the quarter and we expect the full year impact to be approximately $0.07 or $0.08. The principal driver of FPL's earnings growth in the quarter was continued investment in the business. We invested roughly $700 million in the quarter and expect our full year capital investments to be on the order of $3 billion. Regulatory capital employs growth of 9.3% over the same quarter last year with the main driver of net income growth. Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes was 11.07%. This includes the impact of the Project Momentum transition costs, absent these costs the regulatory ROE would have been 11.25%. Under the current rate agreement we record reserve amortization entries to achieve a predetermine regulatory ROE for each period, in this case the 11.25%, that I just mentioned excluding special charges such as the Project Momentum transition costs. During the quarter we reversed 10 million of reserve amortization recorded earlier in the year in order to achieve this predetermined ROE. Looking forward we expect to maintain a regulatory ROE of 11.25%, excluding Momentum transition costs for the balance for the year, which will likely mean we will use between $170 million and $180 million of reserved amortization in 2013.And we'll end with the reserve amortization balance of approximately $220 million to $230 million, assuming normal weather for the remainder of the year. Looking beyond this year, we believe that our expected end of year reserve balance, when combined with our weather normalized sales growth forecast at 1.5% to 2% per year and our current O&M expectations, as well as the commitment of a 4-year total of roughly $7 billion in infrastructure CapEx, will allow us to support regulatory ROEs in the upper half of the allowed band of 9.5% to 11.5% for the remaining period of the current rate agreement. Furthermore, we expect that we can do this while keeping typical residential customer bills the lowest in the state and among the lowest in the country, and improving on our already excellent reliability in customer service records. If we are successful in meeting our expectations, by 2016, we will have further improved our already outstanding customer value proposition and we will be well-positioned for whatever proceedings are required to determine rates for 2017 and beyond. Turning to our development efforts. All of our major capital projects at FPL are progressing well and in October, we received approval from the FPSC for 2014 nuclear clause recovery of our full request, which includes recovery of extended power upgrade investment completed earlier this year. FPL's nuclear plant upgrades with the largest in recent U.S. history and added more than 500 megawatts of zero-emission capacity to our system. In addition to helping improve our fleet's overall fuel diversity, these upgrades are already delivering millions in fossil fuel savings for FPL customers. Our Riviera Beach and Port Everglades modernization are both running on time and on budget. Riviera Beach is about 90% complete and is expected to come into service by mid-2014. Site clearance at Port Everglades is underway and construction is slated to begin in the spring of next year with an expected in-service date by mid-2016. We are also moving through the regulatory process on a number of our growth initiatives. Last week, the commission voted unanimously to approve FPL's natural gas transportation capacity contracts that support a new pipeline into the state. While this decision is still subject to appeal, it is an essential first step to enable the stable trail transmission and Florida Southeast connection pipeline projects to move towards construction. Additionally, our Commission decision on our accelerated storm hardening program is expected in the coming weeks and hearings on our request to upgrade pigging capacity included in our environmental cost recovery close filing earlier this year are currently scheduled for December, with the Commission decision expected in January. The programs we have laid out to accelerate and expand reliability investments to improve our system infrastructure are also progressing well. During the quarter, we activated more of the functionality of our smart meters, including remote connect and disconnect. We also continued our deployment of automated feeder switches and fault current indicators. Year-to-date, we have avoided almost 300,000 customer interruptions due to this technology. We also have commissioned a new substation relay system designed to help reduce outage exposure and outage time and it will be rolled out to many of our substations over the coming years. We continue to make good progress on hardening our feeders, replacing wood transmission structures with steel or concrete, as well as our other storm hardening efforts. Recall, the general infrastructure and storm hardening investments do not have separate cost recovery mechanisms. Costs incurred as part of these programs will be absorbed in our current rate structure for the next 4 years. Let me now spend a few minutes on the Florida economy. Overall, Florida's economy continues to improve. Most of indicators we track have improved relative to a year ago and the economy continues to expand at a moderate pace. Unemployment ticked down again in August at 7%, rolling from over 11% in August 2010. The number of jobs in the state is up 1.8% compared with the year ago, outpacing the average of the rest of the country. However, we are seeing some signs that the rate of growth maybe moderating. Consumer confidence is diminished a bit in recent months and there are signs that the strong growth in retail sales may be tapering off. As the accompanying chart shows, new building permits have dropped from their recent peak, although they remain at a healthy level. As you all know, events in Washington in recent months have not been supportive of consumer confidence and some of what we're seeing here in Florida maybe just a temporary pause. Nevertheless, as we have noted before, we believe that full recovery in Florida will depend in part on continued improvement in other parts of the country. The fundamental attractiveness of our state remains strong and a number of studies suggest that Florida has improved its economic competitiveness relative to most other states over the past few years. Learning from the general Florida metrics to our own, Florida's customer count averaged approximately 53,000 or 1.2% higher than in the comparable quarter in 2012. This is a significantly higher growth rate than we expected or than we have been running recently. However, a significant portion of this, probably about 1/4, can be attributed to the rollout of our remote connect and disconnect capability enabled by our Smart Meter program. This ability to more efficiently and inexpensively manage the connect and disconnect processes, has in turn, led to a sharp drop in our number of inactive accounts, that is meters installed for which we have no customer account. While a sharp increase in customers in the corresponding decline in inactive meters is an excellent development, it does complicate our analysis of growth. Not surprisingly, the larger number of customer accounts being activated are disproportionately residential and therefore, have lower usage in our average retail accounts. Thus, the impact on volume growth for new customers is much less than 1.2%. In the accompanying chart in the top left, we've attempted to adjust for this effect. We estimate that customer growth of 1.2% drove volume growth of 0.5%, while weather driven usage was negative 0.7% and underlying usage per customer was down slightly. Regardless of the exact contributions from customer growth and usage impacts, it is clear that overall weather adjusted volume was up only slightly compared with the third quarter of last year. While a single quarter of weak growth should not be a cause of concern, we will obviously be watching closely to see if there's any structural change going on or if we are just seeing a temporary effect. Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported third quarter 2013 GAAP earnings of $281 million or $0.66 per share. Adjusted earnings for the third quarter were $190 million or $0.45 per share. Adjusted earnings exclude the mark-to-market effects of nonqualifying hedges and the net effect of other than temporary impairments or OTTI on certain investments. Beginning in the third quarter, adjusted earnings also exclude after-tax operating results associated with the Spain solar projects. Energy Resources had a good quarter, with contribution to adjusted EPS increasing $0.07 versus the prior year comparable quarter, despite the impact of the transition costs associated with Project Momentum, that I spoke about earlier on the call. These transition costs negatively impacted the quarter by roughly $0.01 and we expect the full year impact to Energy Resources to be approximately $0.02 or $0.03. Contributions from new investments with the primary driver of adjusted earnings growth for the quarter and generated roughly $0.08 up the year-over-year increase. The gas infrastructure business contributed $0.02 to growth due to additional production over the prior year, offsetting these gains were lower contributions from our customer supply and trading businesses, which declined $0.03 versus the third quarter last year, due in large part to lower margins in our full requirements business. All other effects in the quarter were minor. The Energy Resources team continues to drive execution on our growth plans. As mentioned earlier in the call, during the quarter, we brought into service a Canadian wind project with a capacity of roughly 125 megawatts. As a reminder, we have approximately 475 megawatts of additional Canadian wind capacity, which we expect will enter service in 2014 and 2015. We continue to expect to bring approximately 300 megawatts of contracted solar projects into service this year or early next year with the addition of our 20-megawatt Mountain View project and a partial commissioning of our Genesis and Desert Sunlight projects. The balance of Genesis and Desert Sunlight, as well as our 250-megawatt Macquarie project are expected to come into service by the end of 2016. Turning to our U.S. wind program. The team recently signed a PPA for a 200-megawatt project, which is expected to come into service in late 2014 or 2015, bringing our total new contracted U.S. wind development portfolio to approximately 1,175 megawatts. The IRS recently provided additional clarity around the requirements for projects to qualify for the PTC under the Safe Harbor provisions that were included in the January PTC extension. The new IRS guidance essentially provides that U.S. wind projects satisfying the Safe Harbor provisions that are placed in service by year-end 2015, will be eligible for the PTC. While we have yet to determine the impact that this guidance could have on our projections, the new wind projects in the 2014 to 2015 timeframe, we consider this a positive development for our U.S. wind program and we will continue to provide updates in our expectations as we move forward. We are also working to continue to build our solar business. We previously discussed the potential for adding 1 or possibly 2 more large scale solar projects before the end of 2016 and I'm pleased to note that we have recently entered into an agreement to purchase a development projects for the First Solar who will complete the development process and also provide EPC services for us. While there are a number of additional milestones to be achieved before we can consider this transaction complete, this is an important step for our solar portfolio. This project will have a capacity of approximately 250 megawatts and operate under a 20-year PPA. Total capital cost is estimated at $1.1 billion. Together with the 40-megawatt projects that we announced earlier this year, this project would bring the portfolio of incremental solar to about 290 megawatts, near the top end of the expected range of 0 to 300 megawatts that we discussed at our investor conference. We now have nearly 1,100 megawatts of U.S. contracted solar projects in our development portfolio. As we do each year in the third quarter, we have updated our accrued in gross margin hedge slides and included an additional year forward. The portfolio of financial information for 2014 and 2015 can be found in the appendix to the presentation. For 2014, old projects which are expected to be in service by the end of 2013, have been moved to their respective categories, which in this case, include both contracted wind for the wind projects and contracted other for our solar additions. For 2015, projects expected to come into service in both 2014 and 2015 are included in the new investment line. I would like to emphasize that this includes only contributions from projects for which we have assigned PPA. I would also like to remind everyone that these charts use a metric that we call equivalent EBITDA in order to put all our businesses on a comparable basis for the purpose of analyzing our exposure to first order changes in future commodity prices, primarily movements in forward prices for natural gas, power and spark spreads. Equivalent EBITDA is not a GAAP measure and should not be thought of as a surrogate for or constituent of cash flows. Looking at the company on a consolidated basis. For the third quarter of 2013, NextEra Energy's GAAP net income was $698 million or $1.64 per share. NextEra Energy's 2013 third quarter adjusted earnings in adjusted EPS was $607 million and $1.43, respectively. The Corporate and other segment was up $0.04 versus the prior year, primarily because last year's Q3 results included a small asset impairment charge of $0.03. We continue to expect the full year contributions from this segment to improve modestly related to 2012, in part due to increased contributions from our Lone Star Transmission line, which went into service in the spring of this year. Other areas of our transmission business are also progressing well. We were recently designated by the Ontario Energy Board to develop the East-West Tie Line Transmission project with our partners, Enbridge and Borealis. While we still need approval to construct the line, following the development process, we certainly consider this a positive first step. We look forward to providing you with updates on this project, as well as others mentioned in our investor conference as our transmission team continues its development efforts. Before closing, I'd like to make a few comments on our financing plans and cash flow position. We've repeatedly noted the important role of balance sheet strength and credit play in our overall competitive strategy. At our investor conference in March, we discussed our expected growth in cash flow and our focus on returning to credit metrics more consistent with our past performance no later than 2014. We indicated that dependent on our success in firming up what we call incremental investment opportunities, we expected to need to issue up to $1.5 billion in equity in 2014 in order to achieve our target credit metrics. We have also indicated we expected the majority, if not all of this, to be in the former Street common rather than equity units. In the accompanying chart, we have shown some of the principal credit metrics that we track with our expectations for 2014 and the corresponding ranges that the rating agencies indicate for those metrics at our ratings. You will note that we expect to see our metrics return to levels fully consistent with our rating by next year. Since the March investor conference, we have obviously enjoyed significant success in firming up many of incremental growth opportunities. While various approvals and permits are still needed, we feel very confident that we will be able to move forward with much, if not all of the incremental investment, sometime over the next 3 or 4 years. As a result, today, our best estimate is that we will need to issue at least $1 billion in incremental equity before the end of next year. In pursuing the necessary financing to support our growth plans, including issuing new equity, we expect to be, as we have been in the past, opportunistic as to the exact timing structuring of specific transactions. We will take advantage where we can of favorable market opportunities and will not lock ourselves into a preset schedule. As you think about our financing needs, as well as our overall value proposition, it will be important to keep in mind our cash flow position. We have previously indicated we expected to see strong growth in cash flows in 2013 with more to come in 2014 and we are on track relative to our expectations this year. In 2012, our cash flow from operations was about $4 billion. This year, we expect it to become about $4.8 billion. And next year, we expect it to be somewhere between $5.6 billion and $5.9 billion consistent with the range we suggested back in March. This would represent growth of nearly 50% over 2 years. The accompanying chart attempts to put this in perspective. We show on the left side of the chart a range of expected distributable cash flow for capital holdings in 2014. Capital holdings is the entity that aggregates all our non-FPL financing activities. Distributable cash flow is defined here as net of expected interest and principal repayment obligations on all limited recourse, project level debt at Energy Resources, as well as net of expected maintenance CapEx. We then compare this with total senior debt of capital holdings, as well as with the sum of senior debt and lower rated subordinated debentures. As you will see, the coverage is strong and is of course further supported by the parent guarantee. The comparison on the right side of the slide, we have also put FPL on a roughly similar basis treating all our infrastructure capital as maintenance CapEx and comparing the resulting expected 2014 distributable cash flow with the total first-mortgage debt outstanding. While there are some differences between FPL and capital holdings not reflected in this analysis, the general comparisons maybe helpful to you. In short, we continue to execute well and if we are successful in meeting our financial expectations for 2014, we will have a very strong and balanced cash flow position across the portfolio. Before leaving the subject the cash flow, I feel sure that 1 or 2 if you will have questions about the status of our thinking on the so-called yield co.. First, let me be clear that we have made no firm decisions at this point. We continue to examine the concept of recycling capital by our focus on investors with the strong interest in yield oriented vehicles, supported by renewable assets, whether in a public or a private format. During the quarter, we have observed further developments that appear to support the viability of the concept, at least under current market conditions. We've spent some time looking at the specifics of our own portfolio, and now estimate that we have perhaps 1,500 to 2,000 megawatts of operating assets that would fit the desired format with another 1,200 megawatts in the development pipeline, all of which could potentially be contributed during the 2014 to 2017 timeframe. Longer term, additional projects might become suitable, especially as wind projects complete the 10-year period of PTC eligibility. I want to reiterate that we have made no firm decisions and continue to study various alternatives and we'll keep you up-to-date with our thinking as it evolves. Over all, with good performance in Q3 and continued progress on our new initiatives, our financial expectations remain much the same. We continue to see our 2013 adjusted EPS in the upper half of the $4.70 to $5 range that I told you in January. In 2014, we continue to expect earnings per share to be in the range of $5.05 to $5.45. And for the longer-term outlook, we continue to see adjusted EPS growing at a compound annual growth rate of 5% to 7% through 2016, off the 2012 base. As always, our expectation is subject to the usual caveats we provide including normal weather and operating conditions. And in the appendix, we have provided a number of sensitivities around our 2014 expectations. And we'll now open the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith, UBS.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: So first, just to elaborate a little bit further on yield co. and I'm sure further questions will go. Could you talk a little bit more specifically, of those operating assets, how you're thinking about the 1.5 to 2 gigs? What are those assets, if you could at least talk broadly? And then secondly, with respect to the development pipeline, are those assets that have tax attributes today or are you thinking about when you say development, those that are rolling off tax attributes?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Let me take the development side first. As you would expect, that is all renewable, because that's where our development efforts have been concentrated for some time. And a mixture of wind and solar, but excluding wind projects that would be PTC projects for reasons that we discussed before. Of the base, existing operating projects, it would be a mix of projects, heavily renewable, potentially some of our contracted fossil assets as well and the renewables being a mix of wind and solar, wind that has either completed its PTC period or on which we didn't take PTCs.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: And then maybe just more broadly here, if you will. What's the timing on making a decision. I don't want to put you in a back in a lock or anything, but just broadly speaking, what are you waiting for, perhaps the better way to ask it?
Moray P. Dewhurst: I guess the first 1 I can respond to that is we're waiting for our own analyses to be -- to reach a crystallization point. I would say at this stage, each round of review that the senior team has done has enlightened us further, but it also raises more question. So there'll be a series of rounds of those and until we're comfortable with what they've got all issues addressed, we don't feel any compulsion to take pressure to make a decision one way or the other. I think we talked that on the last call, we certainly talk to the conferences about some of the issues that we have. So I'm not going to reiterate those things. But until we're really comfortable that we've got all the pieces buttoned down, as I've said, we don't feel any compulsion to make a decision one way or the other.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: And then lastly if you will; obviously got some IRS guidance in the quarter, can you speak to how much wind you expect to have in the pipeline or qualifying for the PTC by year-end and how this sort of evolved -- how are the IRS guidance and pushing it into '15 has evolved taking it into the pipeline opportunity of the wind?
Moray P. Dewhurst: It's a good question. I think the short answer is no, I can't. Because it's still fairly recent and it has had impact already on the market. So as we discussed before, customers react to their expectations about the PTC program just as we do. So I think we're now going through sort of another round of jointly with customers and potential customers are trying to figure out how much more that may add. So the plus side is, the fundamentally good aspect is that I think it provides more opportunities. There is a little bit of a short-term negative because it takes some of the pressure off individual situations. So I think -- we should be in a better position to give you some thinking about that, probably at the next call. But right now, we're just not far off alone.
Operator: Our next question comes from Paul Ridzon from KeyBanc.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Are you looking specifically at yield co., are you looking at the general idea of an alternative structure?
James L. Robo: We are looking at the general idea of an alternative structure, but with a definite focus on trying to create a structure that's appealing to yield oriented investors with a strong interest in renewables, is probably the best way to put it. So as we discussed on the last call, we're looking at both, what I'll call the public yield co. vehicle, which there are some examples out there, as well as potential into private alternatives, private analogues, if you like.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: I guess yield co. is kind of a vague term. Okay. And then why are you not carving out Project Momentum implementation costs from your adjusted earnings?
Moray P. Dewhurst: I guess we could have, I mean our feeling is they are part of our operating results, but we wanted to call them out so you can make whatever adjustments for your modeling purposes that you should choose.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: And when do you expect that $200 million to $250 million to start hitting impact statement -- hitting the income statement?
Moray P. Dewhurst: We're already seeing some benefits this year. We'll see a lot more next year. I think the best way to think about that is an annualized run rate by 2016. So by the time we get to 2016, we should have a full value of that flowing through.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: And could you just describe, is this headcount, is this process, is it all of the above?
Moray P. Dewhurst: It is all of the above. We undertook a process that generated something like 9,000 individual ideas that various teams worked through and analyzed. And in the end, we have about 1,000 individual ideas that we're now pursuing, so they range over the map in every department or every part of the company was involved. So it's just a little bit of everything. Certainly, there are some headcount implications and the transition cost largely driven by those headcount implications, but there's a lot of changes to the way we conduct work that will allow us to see benefits over time.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: In your resources waterfall chart, you usually have existing assets kind of broken out, I guess that didn't change. But you had a pretty [indiscernible] tough wind headwind. What does that do to earnings?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Yes. I mean, there were lots -- as you might expect, within that broad category, there were lots of ups and downs. The wind for the existing assets was actually a bit better than last year, the wind resource is about the same. We've got a little more output out of the projects. So it's just a whole series of pluses and minuses, but net the existing assets to be about the same.
Operator: Our next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Just a sort of follow-up on the equity needs and the potential for yield co., could one assume that the equity needs would be somewhat satisfied by yield co.?
Moray P. Dewhurst: In theory, I think that's possible. In practice, I don't think it's that likely. I think the yield co. alternative needs to be thought of as sort of a restructuring of where we -- the basic financial structure. So it could be but I think, it's better to think of the equity as just separate from.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Okay. I got you. Then in terms of the equity, should we think of this as basically common or should we think of it as potentially hybrid or something else?
Moray P. Dewhurst: You should think of it as primarily, it's not 100% common. We've continued to manage with a slice of hybrids and a slice of -- let me be explicit. Hybrids for us means the deeply subordinated junior debentures. And then equity units, maybe what you're referring to when you say hybrids. But both of those have a place in the capital structure. But I think we have about the right amount of each of those right now.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Okay, great. And then back to Project Momentum, it does appear that you guys are using a more conservative approach in terms of accounting for the cost to achieve. And I was just wondering, how long would those costs to achieve, should we think is a sort of flow in terms of how they'll progress and you mentioned that the full benefit will sort of show up in 2016, but how do we think about the cost to achieve. I mean will they be sort of steadily run rate here for the next couple of years or how should we think about the cost to achieve and how they might affect your earnings going forward?
Moray P. Dewhurst: At this stage, I would expect that we will see the bulk of them this year. As we indicated in the prepared remarks, we've got maybe $0.10 for this year. There probably will be some in 2014, don't know how much at this stage, but not likely as much as $0.10. And then '15 and beyond, I would be surprised if we have more than a few pennies.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Okay great. And then just finally on the sales growth, you did mention that there was a little anomalies here with in terms of usage, at least of change. And we are seeing, as you know, around the country, sort of more significant pullbacks in usage -- weather normalized usage. Any sense -- I mean you did mention in the prepared remarks and everything, but any sense as to -- anything or any more color that you can give with respect to what you're seeing so far?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Well, if it's anything, I think it's most likely to have to do with general economic conditions. We don't see any signs that this is driven by what I'll call incremental efficiencies. So we bake into our expectations about a percentage point decline every year as new efficiency standards kind of roll through the capital stock. So it's hard to see that this recent phenomenon would represent any sharp change in and efficiency. So I think it's much more likely -- if it is real, to be just due to economics. So I think, the main thing there is -- that we know that several of the indicators at the general economic level seem to be kind of taking a pause and then we also see that same phenomenon in our usage. So we're just a little more cautious that we may be not slowing down, but the rate of growth may be coming down a bit.
Operator: Our next question comes from Greg Gordon with ISI Group.
Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Thanks for the incremental disclosure, very helpful. When we think about how you've contextualized the percent or the portion of your nonutility business that could potentially be eligible for the yield co. structure, how we translate that into the percentage over the $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion of distributable cash you're showing on line 13 comes from those eligible projects?
Moray P. Dewhurst: I think the short answer is, you can't right now because we haven't made the connection between those 2 because frankly, they've been independent streams of activities. So stay tuned on that.
Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then obviously, we also have to figure out or you have to figure out how much debt goes with that to get to a bottom line yield, distributable cash number, how much is amortizing? Those are all the sort of pieces that we have to figure out, right?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Absolutely. The modeling of what it would look like has to take into account all of those things. The other thing to be noted there is just to reiterate our commitment to the strong credit position. We would have to make sure that were we to move forward with a yield co. structure, that we adjust back-up at the corporate level to make sure that we retain the appropriate financial mix and credit metrics that we're targeting there. So that's an extra layer of complexity. It's not just which assets would move down and what's the debt associated with them. But it's also the ripple effect back to the parent company to make sure that you've got everything balanced back there.
Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Otherwise, said in plain English, you just can't push a lot of assets down without also pushing the right amount of debt down so that the current credit remains strong?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Fair enough.
Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Is that right?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Yes, fair enough.
Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: To circle back to Paul's question, I do think it's -- can you comment a little more on what type of metrics you use to measure customer -- underlying customer demand, as it pertains to the weather versus energy efficiency and things because in other regions like, for instance, Arizona, which is also a state recovering from a housing bust, they also saw a big pullback in what they consider to be normalized -- weather normalized demand, very similar to what you're talking about. Can talk about the type of metrics you use to try to get at that and how confident you are that they sort of capture that or what they might be missing?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Well, I'll do my best. I think the real challenge here is that we don't have any metrics that we can really look at on a short-term basis that drill in on this problem. And that's one of the reasons why we many times said in the past that any one quarter, we should expect to see weather adjusted usage per customer move around quite a bit. So even in a period, now going back several years, when on average, underlying usage was growing at about 1 percentage point per year. We would still see individual quarters where it didn't grow at all and other quarters where it grew at 1.5% or 2%. So those sort of quarter-to-quarter things, very hard for us to sort out. So to the core of the question, longer-term, you can look at -- the basic thing you have is the uses usage pattern by segments of customers. And so part of what's going on here is the customer mix is changing and the usage patterns of the customers within the different segments in that mix, also appear to be changing a little bit. In short, we have seen over the last few years much stronger recovery in residential piece and in the small end of the commercial segment and much weaker recovery, if any, in the large commercial piece. So we're really, in terms of metrics, we actually look more to the trends at the segment level.
Operator: Our next question comes from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.
Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: As you look out in the last quarter in terms of developments on yield co., I wonder if you could just talk at a high level as you think about the cost to capital of these approaches to investors that are seeking cash flow. Not in detail, but just holistically as you think about cost to capital, right investor base, et cetera, just how you think about that relative to within NextEra?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Sure. I'll take a crack at that. I think I'm going end-up repeating things that we probably said on the last call, I said at one of the conferences. To me, this is a question about whether there is a segment of investors who simply value a cash flow stream with particular characteristics differently from the way that the rest of the investor base does. And here, in particular, we're talking about a cash flow stream that has high current income, relatively stable, but also with strong and visible growth. I think if you look at the yield co. structures that have been introduced so far, that element of significant predictable growth has been an important distinguisher of how they trade. So to me, that indicates that to the extent there is a discrete investor segment here it's 1 that both likes the solidity of current income, but also is willing to pay for visibility into a meaningful growth pattern. So that, I think, what you're trying to do is structure a vehicle that appeals to that particular segment and then the real core question is how big is that segment, how much more is it willing to pay for the cash flow stream than other investors and is that a transient phenomenon, or one that is going to be around for a while? So that's kind of the framework that we think about, I'm sure Jim and others have slightly different versions, but that's how I think about it.
Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: That's helpful. And within the approach to yield co., one thing that investors sometimes think about is the economic participation of the parent, that is incentive payments back to the parent as return levels are reached. I know it's a little bit more specific, but I know that goal is obviously always to maximize the value of NextEra to shareholders. As you all think about potential participation of the parents in returns at whatever yield co. could be contemplated, is that something that you are generally or positively disposed towards because you want that -- the parent growth and parent participation?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Byrd, it's certainly yet another of the things which we have to consider. I guess the main point I will make there is it does seem to be important that you -- to the extent you can, you create alignment of interests between the 2 sets of investors and one of our concerns is not getting a situation where the interests are divergent. And in that sense, the kind of incentive structures that you're talking about, I think, can play an important role if they are designed correctly. But if it's an important aspect, the specifics of how they're designed are important. But I see them as mostly about aligning interest.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.
Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: A couple of items. One on the O&M cost reduction, the $200 million to $250 million. Is that incremental -- I assume that's the main driver for keeping nominal O&M flat and that there couldn't be kind of a potential down -- actual downward trajectory in O&M being driven off of that?
Moray P. Dewhurst: A couple of comments on that. On a number of occasions, I think at one of the conferences in September, I kind of tried to frame it on the FPL side by saying that last year, we had about $1.5 billion of non-fuel O&M. If you just extrapolated at a traditional 2.5% a year growth rate, what we have been running in the last few years, out to 2016, you would've found that to attain the goal of keeping nominal O&M flat, that would've translated to about $150 million a year run rate reduction. And so that's kind of the scope of the challenge. Now the $200 million to $250 million obviously includes Energy Resources and other parts of the business. But it's why we feel pretty comfortable that we have line of sight on the actions that will be necessary to give us a decent shot at that goal of keeping that O&M flat in nominal terms. Now indirect answer to your question, we certainly haven't -- we're not saying this is all that there is going to be. In fact, one of the important things coming out of Project Momentum is a commitment on going further searches for improvement. So this is where we are today. We've got a lot of work to do to make sure we deliver on that. But we're certainly not going to treat that as that's the only thing that it could possibly be.
Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Got it. And 1 or 2 other questions unrelated on the O&M side. When you commented on the 5% to 7% long-term EPS growth, are you now including items like the pipeline in that number or is that still outside of that number?
Moray P. Dewhurst: No. The 5% to 7% is adjusted EPS growth at the enterprise level. So it's inclusive of everything. And certainly when we share that range in the March investor conference, we discussed the pipeline as a potential project in the incremental investment category. So clearly, it was included in that and it certainly remains so.
Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And finally, the earnings power...
James L. Robo: Michael, this is Jim. I just wanted to add to that. Given the combination of the progress we've made on Project Momentum along with the progress we've made in our development efforts on both sides of the business, I said this in September, I'll say it again now. I will be very disappointed if -- we have a lot of executions still left to do over the next 3 years, but I'll be very disappointed if we don't earn at the top end to that range through 2016, i.e. what I have the teams focused on is earning $6 in 2016.
Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Got it. And on the pipeline, just I want to think about the earnings power. Do you actually accrue AFUDC during the construction of the pipeline and then that kind of converts to cash once it comes online in late 2017?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Yes. And Michael, it's possible, in response to your first question, what you may have been thinking about is where the pipeline shows up in the segment discussion in our forward-looking statements. This does get a little bit more complicated, but everything that we discussed to date has had the potential contribution from the pipeline clustered in the FPL segment. Although we have also indicated that those are not strictly FPL assets. So that may be part of the confusion.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Chin with Merrill Lynch.
Brian Chin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Are there any commitments that you can make with regards to the dividend as it relates to your decision about whether to do a yield co. or not?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Well, first of all, the answer is no. Dividend obviously is a board decision. But I'm not quite sure I'm following the interrelationship between the dividend and the yield co. in your mind.
Brian Chin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Well, when we think about yield co. mechanism, there's significant amount of cash that does come from NextEra Energy Resources that currently helps go towards the parent that helps go towards funding a variety of different activities within the NextEra structure. In the event that you were to drop down any of those assets into a separate yield co. Mechanism, I'm just wondering whether that might have an effect on, whether you might want to think about your dividend for NextEra shares. Is there a separation of that dividend? Or is there a commitment that you can that the yield co. would not have any impact on the dividend? Just trying to get a sense of how you think about that.
Moray P. Dewhurst: Okay. I think I would have to think a little further about the question. I guess my initial reaction is at least at this stage, I don't see the yield co. necessarily leading to any fundamental change in the dividend policy, again, the dividend policy is a matter for the board to decide and any specific implementation within that policy is also a matter for the board to decide.
Operator: Our next question comes from Hugh Wynne with Sanford Bernstein.
Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: I just wanted to ask. You mentioned -- if I heard correctly, that the ability of Florida Power & Light to rely [indiscernible] ROEs through 2016 was predicated on certain assumptions regarding load growth and you gave those numbers but I'm not sure I heard them correctly, I wonder if I can ask you to repeat them and perhaps break them down into their various components.
Moray P. Dewhurst: Yes. In terms of volume growth out through the 2016 period, the average is about -- the expectations average is about 1.5% to 2%. The vast majority of which is coming from customer growth. Essentially what we do for the forecast there is take the -- I believe it's the University of Florida population projections and then factor them down to implications for customer growth. So probably 3 quarters of the growth in the base expectations is coming from customer growth, but the total volume growth expectation is about 1.5% to 2% per year. So call it 1% to 1.5% customers and maybe another 0.5% per year. And the usage side -- the usage piece, just to remind folks, is really still sort of cyclical economic recovery, i.e. getting back towards the average usage per customer level that we saw in 2007, 2008.
Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: So do you happen to have symptom to have the underlying population growth assumption and the usage assumption that go into the 1.5% to 2%?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Take the population growth of, call it 1.3%, 1.4% and maybe 1.5%, so the rest is the usage piece.
Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Okay. So you see usage rising sort of marginally maybe a 0.25% or 0.5% per year as it reverts in your view to the 2007 levels and then the ongoing population growth. And have you told that there were reason to modify that assumption? That just strikes to me as optimistic given trends around the country and recent experience in the service territory.
Moray P. Dewhurst: A couple of comments here. First of all, baked into that usage value is, as I think I'd indicated earlier, an assumption of about a negative 1% a year impact, the ongoing effect of efficiency standards as capital stock rolls through. In terms of the other part of your question, obviously people can judge for themselves whether it's optimistic or pessimistic. It's actually pretty consistent with what we have been running for the last year and a half or so. Actually usage growth has been little stronger than that over that period. So this quarter is a little bit of a pullback from what we have seen. And that's why I was indicating earlier that we just need to have a little more time to see whether that's the start of a new trend or whether it's just a short-term blip.
Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Great. Quickly on the yield co. NRG Energy appears to have acquired some wind and gas assets from the Edison Mission Energy portfolio to contribute to its yield co. Are those assets that you looked at, and if so, can you tell us why you decided not to pursue?
Moray P. Dewhurst: I can't comment on specific assets. All I can say is as I've said in the past that we look at a lot of different things, particularly in the renewable space.
Operator: Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie.
Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research: I actually hate asking questions about yield co. again, but putting it into more of a context, so you're saying that you see about 2,000 or up to 2,000 of existing assets that will qualify for a yield co. structure and about 1,200 of assets currently under development. I mean this is such a small portion of your total portfolio. I mean if this really worth pursuing a public yield co. structure given the cost associated with such a process?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Well, I think the only answer I can give you to that is we don't know. That's why we are continuing to study it. But obviously, the fact that we are continuing to study it suggests that we think it could potentially be significant. I think if you look at the potential multiple expansion on certain types of assets, depending on what you believe about how they're implicitly valued today, you can still scale that up and have a meaningful amount in terms of shareholder value creation. So certainly we're going to try and find opportunities like that but we just don't know at the moment. Jim is going to comment as well.
James L. Robo: And Angie, I think the thing to think about is that's over a period of years that we've laid out somewhere in the order through the next 3 to 4 years. Effectively, all of our renewable assets -- contractor renewable assets, ultimately would -- you could conceptually think about being able to be in the yield co. once the project financing, the tax equity and the PTC lives rolled off. So I think it's not right to think about this being all of it, it's all of it that we can think about in the period of the next 3 to 4 years.
Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research: How about adding the gas pipeline assets to that structure, the future gas pipelines?
Moray P. Dewhurst: I don't think we really thought about that at this stage.
Operator: And that concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Julie Holmes for any additional or closing remarks.
Julie Holmes: Thank you for joining us and if anyone wasn't able to get through on the call, we could follow-up with you separately. Thank you.
Operator: And that concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the NextEra Energy Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. And at this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Julie Holmes, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Julie Holmes: Thank you, Josh. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter 2013 earnings conference call. With me this morning are Jim Robo, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; Moray Dewhurst, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; Armando Pimentel, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources; and Eric Silagy, President of Florida Power & Light Company. Moray will provide an overview of our results, following which our executive team will be available to answer your questions. We will be making statements during this call that are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements, if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release, in the comments made during this conference call, in the risk factors section of the accompanying presentation or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website, nexteraenergy.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. Please also note that today's presentation includes references to adjusted earnings and adjusted EBITDA, which are non-financial GAAP -- which are non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying this presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of the non-GAAP measure to the closest GAAP financial measure. With that, I will turn the call over to Moray.
Moray P. Dewhurst: Thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy had a very successful second quarter. Our financial results were good, driven by new contracted renewable assets at Energy Resources and strong operating performance across the portfolio, and put us a little ahead of where we had expected to be at this point in the year. All of our major existing capital projects progressed satisfactorily, most notably with the Cape Canaveral modernization coming into service ahead of schedule and under budget. In addition, we made excellent progress in firming up some of the additional investment opportunities we have previously discussed and in developing initiatives, which we expect will allow us to maintain our strong competitive cost position. As a consequence, our expectations for this year have improved slightly, while our longer term financial expectations now have additional support. All in all, it was a very good quarter. At FPL, we maintained a regulatory ROE of 11%, while continuing to invest capital in ways that improve the value that we deliver to our customer. Average regulatory capital employed grew roughly 11.5% over the same quarter last year, and was the main driver of our net income growth of about 11%. The FPL team continues to execute well on our major capital projects. The new units at Cape Canaveral ended service in April, under budget and more than a month ahead of schedule. Their fuel efficiency is roughly 30% better than the old units they replaced, and our customers began benefiting from their fuel savings earlier than anticipated. The roughly $1.3 billion Riviera Beach modernization project remains on schedule to enter service in June of 2014, and our third modernization project at Port Everglades reached a major milestone earlier this month, with the demolition of the old 1960s-era plant. Construction of the new plant is slated to begin next spring. FPL also made good progress in pursuing additional initiatives that we have previously mentioned. During the quarter, we filed petitions with the Florida Public Service Commission to accelerate our storm hardening program and upgrade our peaking capacity systems. And we concluded our analysis on the most cost-effective alternative for additional natural gas transportation capacity into Florida. We will discuss these initiatives in greater detail later in the call. At Energy Resources, contribution to adjusted earnings per share was up $0.15 or 37% over the prior year comparable quarter, primarily as a result of new contracted assets added to the portfolio, as well as strong operating performance from our existing assets. We continue to make good progress on our backlog of contracted renewables projects, our Canadian wind program is progressing satisfactorily with approximately 125 megawatts expected to enter service this year, while the remaining roughly 475 megawatts are targeted to come online in 2014 and 2015. We continue to expect roughly 300 megawatts of new contracted solar capacity to enter service in the U.S. this year. The remaining approximately 500 megawatts of the solar backlog, with which we started the year, are expected to come online by the end of 2016. In addition, we will have at least another 40 megawatts, as I will detail later. Turning to the U.S. wind business. Since our last quarterly call, Energy Resources signed contracts for nearly 650 megawatts of new capacity, bringing the total to date for the 2013 to '14 program to roughly 975 megawatts, of which 250 megawatts are expected to enter service this year. This places us firmly in the middle of the range of 500 to 1,500 megawatts that we discussed at our Investor Conference in March, and we are currently in discussions with customers that could bring the total higher. The progress we made during the second quarter continues to support our long-term expectations for EPS growth, and we continue to see a range of growth in adjusted earnings per share of 5% to 7% off the 2012 base. While the baseline capital deployment program we discussed in March continues to support the lower end of this range and while we are pleased with the developments of the last 3 months, we should also note that 2016 is a long way in the future, and there are still many sources of uncertainty that could push us towards either the higher or the lower end of the range. Let me now walk through our results for the second quarter of 2013. I will begin with the results at FPL before moving on to Energy Resources and then the consolidated numbers. For the second quarter of 2013, FPL reported net income of $391 million or $0.92 per share, up $0.07 per share year-over-year. The principal driver of FPL's earnings growth in the quarter was continued investment in the business. We invested roughly $700 million in the quarter and expect to invest approximately $2.9 billion for the full year. Regulatory capital employed growth of roughly 11.5% over the same quarter last year was the main driver of growth in net income of approximately 11%. We utilized $82 million of reserve amortization during the quarter, enabling us to maintain a regulatory ROE of 11%, and we remain comfortable with the balance, which we expect to be roughly $180 million at the end of the year, will be adequate through 2016. Recall that over the past 2 years, we have utilized a larger proportion of reserve amortization during the first half of the year, and we do not expect this year to be any different. We also had expected 2013 to require a higher reserve amortization than in subsequent years, and this remains true. For 2013, we believe that achieving an 11% to 11.25% ROE is reasonable. Economic indicators in Florida continued trending positively during the second quarter, particularly those associated with the recovery of the housing market. Housing inventory levels continue to decline, spurring new construction and price increases across the state. Housing starts in Florida are up 67% year-to-date compared to 28% nationally. Florida building permits, a leading indicator of residential new service accounts, are now at levels not seen since 2007 and have outpaced the nation's quarterly growth by 41%. South Florida home prices are up nearly 13% for the year, which is the highest annual growth we have seen since 2006 and above the Case-Shiller Composite Index. The broader economic outlook in Florida also remains positive. Florida's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in June dropped 1.7 percentage points from the prior year to 7.1%, outpacing the improvement in the national unemployment rate of 0.6% over the same period. Other positive economic data across the state include improvement in taxable sales, which recently surpassed the prerecession peak, as well as the consumer confidence index, which has also recovered to prerecession levels. As Florida's economy continues to recover, it also continues to diversify. According to a recent IT industry report, Florida ranked third in the number of high-tech establishments and fifth in high-tech employment in the U.S. International trade is growing as well, as Florida now ranks second in the number of exporting companies behind only California. Encouraging economic data in Florida continues to be generally reflected in the internal indicators that we follow at FPL. During the second quarter, we averaged approximately 35,000 more customers than in the comparable quarter in 2012, representing an increase of 0.8%. This general level of increase has now been consistent for more than 2 years, and we are optimistic that it will increase modestly in the years ahead. Total retail sales increased 1.0% during the quarter, as customer growth and increased underlying usage offset much cooler than normal temperatures we experienced in May. The number of inactive meters declined 8.5% year-over-year in June, the strongest annual decline in over a decade. We have typically seen seasonal increases in inactive meters between May and June, as many retirees leave for the summer. This year was unusual, as we saw inactive meters actually fall 2.8% between May and June, indicating either less seasonality or a true tightening of the housing market. On the other hand, the proportion of low usage accounts has remained relatively static and appears to reflect a semipermanent increase in the proportion of investor-owned and internationally owned properties. New service accounts are on track to total between 35,000 and 40,000 for the year, and as was the case last quarter, we continued to see growth in our industrial accounts, which are generally tied to the construction industry in our service territory. Overall, we remain encouraged by the positive economic trends and customer metrics in our service territory. As many of you will recall, FPL issued a request for proposal in December 2012 for new natural gas transportation capacity that will help ensure Florida's continued access to clean, affordable U.S.-produced fuel necessary to meet the state's growing needs. Only 2 major pipeline system serve Central and Southern Florida today. A third new pipeline system will increase the diversity and reliability of gas supply for Florida's residents and will bring substantial direct and indirect economic benefits to the state. During the quarter, we completed an extensive analysis of all bids and determined that the best solution for meeting customers' needs economically is a combination of the Sabal Trail Transmission proposal advanced by Spectra Energy for a new northern pipeline originating in Southwestern Alabama and terminating at the new Central Florida hub; and the proposal submitted by Florida Southeast Connection, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of NextEra Energy, for a second southern pipeline to connect the Central Florida hub to FPL's Martin plant. This combination was substantially more economical than any other combination of bids and promises to deliver excellent value to FPL's customers decades to come. Late last week, FPL filed with the PSC for prudence review of the necessary contractual arrangements for both Sabal Trail and Florida Southeast Connection, and we are seeking regulatory approval by the end of 2013. Consistent with what we have stated previously about NextEra Energy's willingness to invest in the northern pipeline to ensure that FPL has the necessary natural gas transportation capacity when it is needed, we have agreed to invest approximately 1/3 of the capital needed to complete the Sabal Trail pipeline, which is expected to total roughly $3 billion. The NextEra Energy investment in Florida Southeast Connection is expected to total approximately $550 million. Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported second quarter 2013 GAAP earnings of $229 million or $0.54 per share. Adjusted earnings for the second quarter were $238 million or $0.56 per share. Adjusted earnings exclude the mark-to-market effects of non-qualifying hedges, which beginning in the second quarter 2013, include interest rate hedges related to the Spain solar project, as well as the net effect of other than temporary impairments, or OTTI, on certain investments. Energy Resources had a strong quarter, with contributions to adjusted EPS increasing $0.15 year-over-year. Contributions from new investments placed into service since the second quarter of 2012 increased $0.12. We are targeting approximately 300 megawatts of solar this year for CITC election, equating to roughly $75 million in full year adjusted earnings. Adjusted earnings per share from our existing assets increased $0.04 over the second quarter last year due to favorable wind generation, the absence of a power derated Seabrook and the absence of outages at our 2 Texas combined cycle plants. Our gas infrastructure business increased $0.02 from additional production, while the customer supply and trading businesses were down $0.03. All other effects were minor. Energy Resources had a successful quarter in the capital markets. We completed $170 million differential membership interest or tax equity transaction on approximately 160 megawatts of contracted wind projects. We continue to expect the proportion of PTCs allocated to investors to grow to nearly 50% in 2013, up from approximately 41% in 2012. We also completed the company's largest project financing in our history, a $1.15 billion term loan on our natural gas plants in Texas, which significantly exceeds the book value of the assets. The success of this financing positions our Texas portfolio well, and is indicative of our continued ability to access different segments of the capital markets at attractive rates. We will continue to pursue suitable tax equity and project finance structures to support our overall corporate credit position, and our cash flow growth year-to-date is consistent with our projections for credit metric improvement that we discussed at our Investor Conference in March. I want to take a moment to address a number of recent inquiries from investors about our interest in forming a so-called Yield Co. for a segment of Energy Resources contracted assets. While we have made no decisions yet and do not feel any great urgency to undertake a major structural change that might prove difficult or costly to reverse, we are actively examining this and other alternatives that might highlight the value of our contracted renewable asset portfolio or might enable us to access a pool of capital with different risk return requirements. As we examine these alternatives, we are very focused on the question of whether and how they might create long-term, sustainable value for our shareholders. And we are sensitive to the fact that our situation is unique and therefore, blindly copying a solution that is suitable for another company may not be the best for our shareholders. Looking at the company on a consolidated basis. For the second quarter of 2013, NextEra Energy's GAAP net income was $610 million or $1.44 per share. NextEra Energy's 2013 second quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS was $620 million and $1.46, respectively. The Corporate & Other segment was down slightly from the same quarter last year, but we continue to expect the full year contributions from this segment to improve modestly relative to 2012. Before taking your questions, let me turn the call over to Jim Robo for some closing remarks.
James L. Robo: Thanks, Moray. At our Investor Conference in March, we laid out a series of potential incremental investment opportunities at both our major businesses that we indicated could take us beyond the growth profile implied by the backlog of projects that we enjoyed at that time. I would like to take a moment to summarize where we stand on those opportunities. Starting with FPL, we indicated that we saw the potential for investing additional dollars in storm hardening and reliability programs, depending upon progress in improving our already strong O&M performance. We've now filed with the PSC a proposed storm hardening plan that will effectively accelerate roughly $400 million of capital spending into the 2013 through '16 time period, and we've also increased our expectations for general infrastructure capital expenditures for the same period by roughly $700 million. All these initiatives are designed to improve our T&D service reliability or to otherwise improve customer service. We are confident our cost position will allow us to absorb these expenditures under the rate agreement, while still earning an adequate return for our shareholders. In June, we completed our analysis on the most economical way to upgrade our peaking capacity, and on June 28, we filed with the PSC a plan for upgrade that will cost approximately $820 million and will be completed by the end of 2016. We believe this proposed program should be eligible for recovery under the environmental cost recovery clause. A hearing is scheduled to be held in November, and a decision is expected later that month. As Moray mentioned earlier, our capital commitment to support the development and construction of the new third gas pipeline could total roughly $1.6 billion, and we hope to have a PSC decision on this project by the end of the year. We continue to look for opportunities to bring more solar generation to Florida and have 500 megawatts of sites more or less ready to move forward. However, we think the most likely timeframe for this initiative will be in 2015 or '16. And finally, we continue to pursue opportunities to serve others within the state, either at retail or through wholesale contracts, and we hope to close the Vero Beach acquisition in 2014. At Energy Resources, our U.S. wind program for 2013 and '14 now stands at close to 1,000 megawatts or roughly $1.7 billion worth of capital expenditures, with potential to grow up to 1,500 megawatts. We are making progress on our initiative to add up to 300 megawatts of incremental U.S. solar by pursuing both greenfield development and acquisition opportunities. We have already signed contracts on 40 megawatts of U.S. solar earlier this year, and we see the possibility of 1 additional large-scale project being finalized within the next few months Underpinning all of our new investment and growth initiatives is our continued commitment to enhancing our already strong, competitive cost position. We have undertaken a company-wide initiative aimed at rethinking our approach to all aspects of how we do business, and I'm very pleased with the many thoughtful and creative ideas that our employees have put forth. While we are only just beginning to move into the implementation, we believe that the entire portfolio of ideas will enable us to attain our goal of keeping total, non-fuel O&M flat and nominal terms at FPL through 2016, and at the same time, support Energy Resources' growth objectives. This company-wide initiative has also helped identify a number of areas where we expect to improve margins and grow revenue at Energy Resources. At our March Conference, we indicated that the capital associated with all of our incremental opportunities might total as much as $9 billion. To date, we have firmed up roughly $5 billion of incremental growth capital that we expect to deploy through 2016. While we still have a long way to go to bring the project shown on this slide to fruition, I'm pleased with the progress we have made. Although the exact proportions will vary, at this point, we continue to see roughly 60% of our capital expenditures going towards FPL and other rate-regulated opportunities, while nearly all our growth capital and energy resources is going into long-term contracted assets. Consequently, we continue to expect our portfolio mix and earnings profile to shift towards a more regulated and long-term contracted business. Adjusted EBITDA coming from our regulated and long-term contracted operations is expected to reach roughly 84% of the total in 2016. Turning to the financial outlook. We are not anticipating that the second half of the year will be quite as strong as the first half. But based on our performance year-to-date, we think it is reasonable to expect our full year adjusted EPS to be in the upper half of the $4.70 to $5 range that we had previously communicated. For the longer-term outlook, we continue to see adjusted EPS growing at a compound annual growth rate of 5% to 7% through 2016 off a 2012 base. The positive developments of this quarter clearly provide additional support for this growth range. As always, our expectations are subject to the usual caveats we provide, including normal weather and operating conditions. As we continue to invest to build and grow our businesses, we expect to maintain our strong credit position. Our cash flow profile is improving, which by itself, will help our credit metrics return to historical levels. In addition, as we've discussed at the Investor Conference in March, we currently expect to issue incremental equity to the extent our capital program requires it. There has been no major change in our thinking here, with the potential for up to $1.5 billion of incremental equity if we were to be at the top end of our range of capital investment. Given the likely timelines for various regulatory proceedings, we expect we will have a firmer sense of our requirements early in 2014. Before turning the call back to Moray for questions, let me close by, again, summarizing our focus for the remainder of 2013. First, as always, we must maintain our focus on excellence in day-to-day operations. We can never afford to lose sight of the fact that our long-term success is built on delivering outstanding value for our customers at FPL and on operating efficiently and reliably across the portfolio. Second, we will be very focused on moving the large portfolio of ideas we have developed for improving productivity and day-to-day operations from the idea stage to practical reality. We have much implementation planning and, of course, execution ahead of us to ensure that customers and shareholders ultimately realize the value of the good work that has been done so far. At FPL, we have 2 modernization projects underway that we are committed to bringing into service on schedule and on budget. We will also be working on a larger portfolio of reliability investments, primarily in the T&D system, which we are committed to completing as soon as we practically can. And third, we have some important new initiatives, particularly the peaker upgrades and the new gas pipeline that will require development, regulatory and, ultimately, large-scale construction activities to bring to fruition. The FPL team will have much on their plate. At Energy Resources, in addition to a focus on excellence in daily operations, we must continue to push forward with development and construction on the large backlog of contracted renewable projects that we have, which today totals more than 2,400 megawatts, while also seeking additional opportunities to add to that backlog the Energy Resources team will have much on their plate as well. Of course, this is not the sum total of our challenges, but if we are successful with these, we will have a strong future ahead of us. With that, we will now open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we will first go to the side of Dan Eggers with Crédit Suisse.
Dan Eggers - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Just kind of on this Yield Co. conversation. I know you guys are still on the evaluation mode, but a number of years ago when the wind IPO was a very popular idea, I know you guys took a look at that also. Can you just maybe share your thoughts on what you guys learned looking into the process of separation, and what kind of bearing that can have as you think about the institutional impact of if you guys were to go forward or something at this point?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Sure, I'll give that a try. Just reflecting back on where we were back in 2006, 2007, one of the things that we observed then, and it would certainly apply in the current case, is that there are some incremental costs associated with setting up a separate structure. So we should -- they're not massive, but we shouldn't underestimate them either. So for us, that suggests that we really need to try and understand whether there is a reasonably long-term sustainable opportunity here, or whether we're just seeing a sort of transient divergence in capital market prices. So I think if you reflect on the renewable spin-off phase, at least a couple of those looked very strong initially, but the performance was not sustained. And I think reflecting on where we are now, we wouldn't want to be in a situation where we've incurred all the incremental costs and only a short time later, we find ourselves effectively looking for a way to reverse that. So having said that, to the extent that there's really a pool of capital here that prices certain risk characteristics differently than the main capital markets, that is something that we would certainly want to try and take advantage of. I should point out, however, that it isn't necessarily simply a public pool of capital, there may be other ways of accessing investors who have the same sort of risk return profile. So one of the other things that I've talked about with at least some of you before that we have in the mix is also whether there are individual large investors who would be interested in a portion -- taking a position in a portion of the portfolio. So there's a variety of structural ways that we might go about accessing that sort of capital. So those are some of the things we're looking at right now.
Dan Eggers - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And I guess just on the wind additions were quite strong in the quarter and interesting. For the Colorado projects, they were done because the economics were good, not because they were trying to meet renewable standards. I didn't know if Armando or Mike or somebody want to talk about kind of the bigger landscape for projects that you guys are looking at for customers and what is the prospects? And how long is the timetable do you think to sign contracts between now and year end to qualify for PTCs?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Yes. Let me ask Armando to address that. But first, just generally, I don't think there's been a great deal of change in what we're seeing. Obviously, customers, as well as we, are aware of what the situation is with the PTC program right now. So there's a strong incentive to the extent that you either have a renewable portfolio obligation in the near term, or to the extent that the economics in your particular area look attractive to negotiate and sign if you can. But Armando, you want to comment further?
Armando Pimentel: Dan, what we're seeing right now is there was certainly a good slew of RFP opportunities, I'd say starting late first quarter, really progressing through the second quarter this year. As Moray just indicated though, everyone is keenly aware of the PTC expiration. Once again, the words are a bit different this time around than they have been in the past. What we're seeing right now is a slew of additional RFP opportunities out there, whether all of those opportunities, whether all of those RFPs come to fruition in real projects remains to be seen. I'd say that the majority of the opportunities that we're seeing are still RPS-related, but there's a good portion of the opportunities that were either the states or the individual customers have met their RPS requirements and are really looking to buy what we call economic wind. So I'd say there's another 2 to 3 months probably this year where we will -- we and others will have the opportunity to sign up projects for 2013 and 2014. And I think after that, it will slow down a bit.
Moray P. Dewhurst: Yes. I think, if we're -- as I've said before, if we're not kind of buttoned down by the fall, then it's probably not going to happen, unless there's some change in the PTC program. So there is a clear sense of urgency.
Operator: Our next question comes from the side of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.
Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Moray, I wanted to go to the point you mentioned about thinking about long-term sustainable value of the Yield Co. as the pros and cons. One of the dynamics that I looked at a lot is the earnings profile for the business relative to free cash flow, and currently resources has very good earnings, but the free cash flow is far greater than the earnings, and that's often a profile you see for renewables assets. Is that a dynamic that you all think about in the context of the Yield Co.?
Moray P. Dewhurst: It's certainly in the mix. I wouldn't say that it's, at least at this stage, one of the principal drivers that we're seeing. And by that, I mean that the cash flow to earnings profile will naturally change over time. And as we've discussed at the Investor Conference, in the next couple of years, we're going to see that strong cash flow generation at Energy Resources much more manifest in the overall corporate numbers, just the way the dynamics of the portfolio are moving. So I think that's going to become more obvious anyway. I think on the fundamentals of the Yield Co., it seems to me, more around whether there's a systematic difference in the way certain investors value different combinations of essentially risk and growth. I mean, obviously, what you're doing in a Yield Co. format is you're creating something that has very visible yield, very visible income and also the potential for essentially a certain degree of controllable growth or pre-specified growth, I guess a better way of putting it. Well, that kind of structure, it seems to me in today's environment, should be very attractive to investors. So that's not in question. The question is whether the valuation of that cash flow stream in a separate format did in fact any higher than is implicit in the overall corporate format, and that's a question that is a little tougher to sort out. So one of the things that we certainly want to do is take advantage of the fact that we're not under any time pressure here to see how some of the existing vehicles that are now out there trade. I think that's going to give us a lot more insight.
Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: That's very helpful. And just as a follow-up. If you think about the M&A environment for renewables assets, I know in the past, you've been targeting double-digit unlevered returns, and that would put the levered equity returns, in our view at least, above 20%. These days, from what we see at least, the target return levels continue to come down. It's a competitive environment, more into the sort of low double-digit equity returns. As you think about a Yield Co. as a currency relative to, say, NextEra, which is many investors think on a sort of EPS accretion basis, how do you see a Yield Co. as a -- in the context of M&A and growth?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Well, I guess, to me, it comes back to the point that I was discussing earlier, which is whether there's fundamentally a different pool of investors with different -- that place different value on certain risk and growth combinations. To the extent there is, then it seems to me you want to take advantage of that source of capital regardless. To the extent that it's not, then I think a Yield Co. -- so-called Yield Co. currency could end up simply misleading you as to the appropriate prices. In other words, I would hate for to be in a situation where having such a vehicle puts pressure on you to lower the underlying returns that you're targeting in the things that you're going after, because those things really should be based on the investors' risk-adjusted opportunity costs. So I'm a little bit leery of it in that respect. But again, I want to emphasize that to me, it really comes down to the question of whether there's a distinct pool of investors who fundamentally value different cash flow streams with different risk and growth characteristics differently.
Operator: Our next question comes from the side of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: I guess we've beat the Yield Co. question to death, so I won't go there. Can you just -- what was the wind resource last quarter? I know you revamped your algorithm.
Moray P. Dewhurst: It's -- there's a new chart in the back of the release, which we've recalibrated and frankly simplified our calculation of the wind resource, so we have reintroduced it. I just want to caution people that these new numbers are not comparable to the old numbers that we had. Off-line, we can talk all about the gory details of that. But the bottom line is that, in the first quarter, it was slightly below. I think it was like 97%.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: I'm sorry, let me clarify my question. What was it in the second quarter of 2012?
Moray P. Dewhurst: The short answer is, I don't know on the current basis exactly because we haven't gone back and redone everything in history, but it was certainly below average. So there's no question that the average wind resource shifted around from the low long-term averages to above long-term averages.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then just 2 short questions. You talked about second half might be a little more challenging. Could you outline some of those challenges, and then just an update on where things are in Spain?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Sure. On the second half -- I guess 2 points on the second half. First of all, the comment was meant to say that some of the things that have been good in the first half are just things that were good in the first half, and we have no necessary reason to believe that they're going to perpetuate into the second half. And then secondly and separately, there are some things that we see ahead in the second half, primarily for Energy Resources, that we expect to be a little more of a challenge. The main one, 2 principal ones, certain sort of timing matters on the O&M front, so I think we're just a little bit ahead of where we expect it to be in the first half. Some of that will reverse. But the bigger thing is the -- so far, at least, we haven't had much summer weather in Texas. So I think the opportunity is open for what we call asset optimization activities in the Texas portfolio again to be a little less than we would either expect for a normal year or relative to last year. And the second question on Spain, forgive me, I've talked to so many people about different developments in Spain and so many things have happened over the course of the past few months. So relative to where we were last quarter, the principal thing that has happened is the Spanish government has come out with yet another round of changes to the tariff regime for renewables. The current -- what they're talking about is a regime that in general terms would offer investors, at least as they've stated it, a set margin, pretax margin over Spanish government bond yields. However, there's a lot of details that need to be worked out before anybody could understand what that would actually mean for economics. As a practical matter, if it's as they stated it, a 300 basis point pretax spread over Spanish government bond yields, that clearly doesn't help project economics even compared with the confiscatory changes they had made before. So as a practical matter, we continue to believe that we are in the same situation, which is that our economic exposure is limited to the remaining equity contribution, which is not material now. And operationally, the plants are up and running very well. So a disappointing irony here is on the operation side doing better than we expected, but as a practical matter, economically there doesn't appear to be much future for us in it. So again, just to remind everybody, we have taken out from our financial expectations all earnings and cash flow contributions from the Spanish assets.
Operator: Our next question comes from the side of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: I wanted to just -- and I'm sorry if I missed this, the Sabal pipeline and the gas pipeline, in terms of the earnings, how should we think of the -- is there any impact before it comes on? Yes, I know there's some variability in what you guys might actually invest. But is there any earnings before the pipeline actually comes online that like an AFUDC kind of thing that might happen, or can you just elaborate a little bit on that?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Yes. Both portions, both the upstream and the downstream portion would receive AFUDC accounting because they're both regulated pipelines, so it'll be a contribution that way. The Sabal Trail portion, the upstream portion, would be accounted for by us on the equity method, so we would just carry up a portion of whatever Spectra is recording there. But yes, there will be an earnings impact -- a cash earnings impact through the construction period. After that, after it goes into service, I think folks should recognize that the long-term economic prospects of the upstream portion look very good, but they are fundamentally tied to the continued growth and development of the state. Initially, the pipeline will not be fully subscribed, as you would expect. You clearly build these things with room for growth. And so the short-term economics will not be representative of the long-term economics. The reality is that FPL customers are getting a great deal in here, and the economics -- the long-term economics of the upstream portion of the pipeline are fundamentally dependent upon incremental volume and growth in the FPL volumes in future years. So we are obviously very optimistic about that, but that piece, the growth piece remains to be seen.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Sounds like a great project. Let me just ask you, in terms of the solar opportunities in Florida that Jim was mentioning, is there any legislation that's contemplated or needed? Or can you do it right now with what you have in place in Florida?
Moray P. Dewhurst: There's no guiding legislation either in place or currently contemplated, so that's the first part. As to the second part, could we do it right now? I think that the best way to answer that is to say not really. The reality is that the commission fundamentally is required to look at the lowest cost -- look at and approve the lowest cost resource part. Now they do have some flexibility within that to consider what may happen down the road. But I think at this stage, given -- particularly given all the other things we've got going on, it would be a little bit of a challenge to add that on top. So that's why in the prepared remarks, Jim made the comment. I think the realistic time to moving forward on that is probably 2015, 2016.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Okay. And then just in terms of the Yield Co. and all that stuff, it sounds like you guys are taking, obviously, very cautious approach in terms of anything you may do. Should we think of this as probably something that we probably won't hear anything before the end of the year, or -- I hate to put you on the spot on that, but I mean, just sort of in terms of timing and stuff, that sounds like it's going to be some time before you make a decision. Does that make sense? And also does the incremental, the tax equity stuff, does that have any impact on the any of this? The potential of you doing it, do you follow me?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Okay, let me hold the second part of that question. But first, on the timing, I can't say exactly end of year, but I think certainly several months is realistic. We'll certainly give you an update on where we are. I'm sure somebody will ask a question on the third quarter, so we'll certainly give you an update. But yes, I would certainly hope to be in a position to understand a lot more where we might want to be by the end of the year. We won't necessarily be in a position to execute even if we do have something that we ultimately want to execute. On the question, the tax equity transactions, in a sense, yes, there is an interaction here. And since it goes back to the fundamentals that we were talking about earlier, which is different investors' appetite for different combinations of current income and future cash flow growth and risk. In a sense, things like tax equity and project finance even are already examples for slightly different forms of vehicle that the Yield Co. represent. So you can sort of put them on a spectrum, if you like, with project finance being at one end of the spectrum, where you are carving off a discrete portion of the cash flow stream of, in this case, the renewable portfolio and packaging it in a particular way that's appealing to certain class of investors. Tax equity transactions do exactly the same thing. Now they don't do it quite the same way that the Yield Co. format does. It's a different combination of current income, cash flow growth and risk. But in my mind, you can place them all on a spectrum. So that's a long-winded way of saying yes, they are -- they do relate. And specifically, when you put these assets into a tax equity transaction, you are effectively precluding them from being in a Yield Co. vehicle in the short term. However, that's not a problem because the Yield Co. format is not well-adapted to accepting assets that are currently in their PTC earning phase. So as a practical matter, it doesn't have a great deal with interaction. But conceptually, yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from the side of Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research.
Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC: Just first on the Florida pipeline, the intrastate piece. Would that have a more timely return relative to the interstate piece that you mentioned before? i.e. is it fully running from the get-go?
Moray P. Dewhurst: No. It will have a -- as I think about it, a slightly more favorable, because fundamentally, as I've said many times to many folks, FPL is the principal customer for the downstream portion, whereas the upstream portion has the potential to serve many other customers over time and it's that growth to serve the other volumes that ultimately should provide the economic leverage that will ensure that the lifetime returns of the upstream portion are attractive. So because the downstream portion is much more heavily likely to be dedicated to FPL, the profile is a little better. But it still has the same thing because what FPL required was a step-up, specified growth in volumes and options on future volumes. So obviously, everybody who competed for the downstream portion had to size the thing for the long term, and so the upfront returns will not be as strong as the lifetime returns.
Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC: Okay. And one other question, just back to the hot topic. Back 3 or 4 years ago, when we had the pure-play renewables storage, you never went through a process like this of evaluating options and the like. So this does seem to be somewhat different than then and seems to be more serious review than 3 or 4 years ago. So is that fair to read that there is more validity to either this structure or something like it than necessarily what you saw when we went through this with the pure-play renewables?
Moray P. Dewhurst: No. I don't think that's a total -- fair, Steve. We may not have been so transparent about it at the time, but we spent an awful lot of time back in 2006, 2007, on various structures at that time, so there was a great deal of work. The key thing then at that time was we could not get ourselves convinced that there really was a -- I'll call it a capital market mispricing opportunity. We thought that there was an unsustainable bubble, if you like. And our conclusion at that time -- again, this is now ancient history, but our conclusion at that time was it didn't justify going through all the distraction and the incremental costs of the establishment of the structure for something that wasn't going to allow us long term to access a different pool of capital. So it's the same fundamental reading we did spend a lot of time on. We may not have been as explicit as we have on this one.
Operator: Next, we will go to the side of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.
Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: On the pipeline, really more of a longer-term strategic question. How should we think about your decision to invest over $1.5 billion of capital into a pipeline? Is this the -- is this a one-off because of the opportunity into the FP&L service territory and into the state of Florida? Or is this more of a strategic move where you could see other incremental pipeline investments down the road, whether stand-alone or via joint ventures with other companies. That's the first part. The second is once the pipeline is online and in service, how do you think about the corporate structuring, meaning the potential for either other JVs or potential master limited partnership opportunities? We're now talking about a sizable investment in midstream assets. So just trying to think through how you're envisioning kind of the 5 to 10-year path?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Well, Michael, I think you're perhaps a little ahead of us here. A fundamental motivation here, this is a Florida project. We are interested in figuring out, as we always have been, how we continue to improve value delivery to our FPL customers here in Florida, and this, we think, is an absolutely critical project, it's a great project, as I said earlier, I think FPL customers are getting a great deal off this, and we want to make sure that we are a part of seeing that, that things happen. That's our fundamental motivation. We are certainly comfortable committing a large amount of capital to this project with these kinds of economics given the overall regulatory environment, but it's fundamentally about serving our FPL customers. Having said that, there is no question that assuming that we are successful in bringing this project to completion, it will provide us with other possibilities. And where that may take us, we're going to have to see. But all of that is off in the future. We're talking right now about -- just as a reminder, a pipeline is going to come into service in 2017 and there's a lot of work to be done to get it to that point, and obviously, the whole set of projects is subject to regulatory approval. So again, it's all about serving our customers in Florida better.
Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And I guess just a quick follow-up. How do you -- how should investors think about the targeted return on capital for the new pipeline project, and will it differ much from the northern leg to the southern leg?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Well, I'm not going to get into the numerical details because obviously, I think my remarks earlier should have suggested there's uncertainty about what certainly the short-term economics are going to be. I think the best way to think about this is you can look at other major pipeline projects across the country and get an idea of the range of economics that are reasonable. As I've said, the long-term economics here, particularly for the upstream portion, are based on continued growth in Florida and the need for natural gas transportation capacity by folks other than just FPL. So we are fundamentally making a positive statement about our belief in the long-term growth of Florida here.
Operator: Next, we will go to the side of Angie Storozynski with Macquarie.
Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research: My first question is about the dividend growth. Given that you have already locked about $5 billion of the additional CapEx, and that will require some additional equity funding, how should we think about growth in dividends? Is there an expectation that some of that growth -- significant pickup in dividends will be delayed because of additional CapEx?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Well, first of all, although it's perhaps an admission against interest, I can't -- I have to dispute your characterization as having things locked in. There are lots of steps that have to be gone through before any of these incremental projects are really in service, so including regulatory approvals for the development steps. So let's not get ahead of ourselves here. Having said that, on the dividend growth front, I'd just go back to what we, I believe, talked about in the March Investor Conference and certainly have talked about subsequently, which is the current target is 55% payout ratio in 2014. Where we go beyond that will clearly depend upon the CapEx profile, and where I'd characterized it before is to suggest that beyond '14, we will hope to see dividend growth at least in line with earnings growth. And by that, I mean that if we're at the higher end of the earnings growth, we will need all the cash flow and we will be in the market for incremental equity as we've discussed, and therefore, we'll probably more likely see dividend growth in line with EPS growth. If we were at the lower end of the CapEx range, then we would clearly have free cash flow available, and that might suggest increasing the payout ratio further, which obviously would imply dividend growth slightly higher than earnings growth. So I still think that framework for thinking about it is reasonable. If we were at the upper end of the CapEx range, the upper end of the EPS growth, then I think dividend growth in line with EPS growth is a reasonable expectation.
Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research: Okay. And completely separately on the new wind projects, we're seeing those prices of wind power in low $20s. Could you briefly talk through what actually offsets the reduction of pricing of electricity versus the returns that you can realize on those projects? I mean, is this that the net capacity factor went up so much? And if so, what is the average Mcf that you are realizing on those new projects? Or is it the cost of new build that has dropped significantly? Basically, I cannot somehow make the numbers work.
Moray P. Dewhurst: Sure. Well, the single biggest driver of the improvement in the economics of the wind projects has clearly been the increase in capacity factors. So to get a PPA in the $20 range and still yield acceptable returns, you have to be in a part of the country that has very strong wind resource and with modern technology turbines, you can expect to see capacity factors as high as 50%, where a decade ago in the same area, we might have been looking at 33%. So that change, when you run it through the numbers, is huge. Secondly, but much lower in importance, it is true that we've seen some relief on the cost side of the turbines, but that I think was more a function of a retreat from very high prices at a time when the turbine supply market was very tight. So I think that is more a cyclical thing. But the long term, the biggest single trend is improvement in technology and improving the capacity factors.
Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research: But the cost of new build is roughly -- is it roughly $1,000 per kilowatt, or is it just slightly above that level?
Moray P. Dewhurst: No, I think if you look at the numbers that we've discussed in the script, I think the average we're looking at is about $1,700 a kW. Obviously, it varies depending upon where you are.
Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research: Okay. And you are still accepting similar levels of returns as you did a couple of years ago?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Yes, the -- over a long period of time, we really haven't seen we've been able to maintain decent, modest spreads over risk-adjusted cost of capital. So obviously, the overall cost of capital has come down over the course of last decade just because real interest rates have come down. But the spreads have been generally in the same kind of range. I think we have time for one more.
Operator: Our last question will come from the side of Hugh Wynne with Sanford Bernstein.
Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: My question goes to the reserve amortization and its impact on regulatory ROEs. My recollection was that you had the option to reverse about $400 million over the '13 to '16 time frame. Did I hear you correctly in saying that of that, $180 million would be left at year end '13?
Moray P. Dewhurst: That's correct.
Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Yes, okay. Implying $220 million to be amortized in '13.
Moray P. Dewhurst: Correct, yes. We had always -- just the way that the dynamics of the business work, we have always been aware that 2013 was going to require a lot more surplus amortization to maintain a given level of ROE. In 2014, among other things, we have a significant pickup on the wholesale side, which we were obviously aware of, so that, that was baked into our thinking about the spread of the $400 million over the course of the period. So I just -- that may perhaps be worth emphasizing that with $180 million leftover at the end of this year, we still feel very comfortable based on where we see our cost structure going, that we are going to be able to maintain healthy ROEs for shareholders for the remainder of the rate agreement period out through 2016. So we feel good about where we are on that.
Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: But basically, the ability to maintain, let's say, an 11% ROE is contingent on, one, the growth of the wholesale sales; and then two, your flat O&M cost forecast? Is that what I heard you just say, or...
Moray P. Dewhurst: Well, I think going forward, it's -- we -- clearly, not so much the wholesale growth because at least the piece I'm talking about is a contract that we've signed some years ago, so we know we're going to be on that. If you look at areas of uncertainty, it would be on retail growth, so customer growth and usage growth, for which our expectations are continued growth on the customer side in the 35,000 to 40,000 a year; and on the usage side of maybe a half to a little bit more percent per year; and then the cost control, which you referred to. So to the extent that there's uncertainty or risk about those 2 elements, and that's reflected in our thinking about where we can be over the course of the rate period. But again, as I said, we feel pretty good about it based on what we see right now. Thank you, everybody.
Julie Holmes: Thank you. For those who didn't get a chance to get their questions answered, please follow up with Investor Relations. Thank you for joining our second quarter call.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the NextEra Energy First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Julie Holmes, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Julie Holmes: Thank you, Leslie. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. With me this morning are Jim Robo, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; Moray Dewhurst, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; Armando Pimentel, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources; and Eric Silagy, President of Florida Power & Light Company. Moray will provide an overview of our results, following which, our executive team will be available to answer your questions. We will be making statements during this call that are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release, in the comments made during this conference call, in the Risk Factors section of the accompanying presentation or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website, nexteraenergy.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. Please also note that today's presentation includes references to adjusted earnings and adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP measures -- financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying this presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of the non-GAAP measure to the closest GAAP financial measure. With that, I will turn the call over to Moray.
Moray P. Dewhurst: Thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy delivered strong results during the first quarter of 2013, and both Florida Power & Light and Energy Resources are executing well on the objectives we've discussed with you last quarter and during our investor conference. At FPL, we maintained a regulatory ROE of 11%, while we continued to invest heavily in the business in ways that enhance what we believe is already the best customer value proposition in the state. Average regulatory capital employed grew roughly 14% over the same quarter last year and was the main driver of our net income growth of about 20%. I am pleased to report that 3 of FPL's major capital projects are now complete. The successful repowering of Turkey Point Unit 4 earlier this month marked the completion of our extended nuclear power uprate program. We also finished installing 4.5 million smart meters across our service territory to serve our customers better. Finally, our first modernization project at Cape Canaveral entered service last week, more than a month earlier than originally expected. And our Riviera Beach and Port Everglades modernizations remain on track. At Energy Resources, adjusted earnings were down slightly compared to the prior year comparable quarter, primarily from lower wind generation. This quarter's adjusted results excludes 3 unusual items: the gain on the sale of our Maine hydro assets, a charge associated with our decision to sell our merchant fossil assets in Maine and charges associated with an impairment on our Spain solar project. I will discuss each of these items in more detail later in the call. Our renewables backlog remains on track, and we continue to make good progress on our incremental growth opportunities. Since our investor conference in March, we signed long-term power purchase agreements for an incremental 150 megawatts of new U.S. wind projects and 40 megawatts of new solar projects. On the transmission front, we successfully energized our Lone Star Transmission line in Texas on time and under budget. We continue to pursue a number of other transmission opportunities in North America, as we discussed at our investor conference in March. Looking beyond this quarter, we are focused on driving long-term growth across our primary businesses that is profitable and creates value. Central to this is a continued search for ways to improve our productivity and relative cost position sustainably. As we mentioned during our recent investor conference, we have initiated a comprehensive company-wide internal review to identify opportunities to continue to improve our businesses through revenue enhancement and O&M savings. Even though our overall relative cost position is excellent, we believe we have room for further improvement. We are fairly early in our review process but we are pleased with our progress, and we will provide updates on this initiative throughout the year. I want to take a brief moment to elaborate on the growth plan we laid out for you at our conference. If we simply complete the projects that were in our backlog in March, which are outlined on the left side of the accompanying slide, we believe we can grow adjusted EPS at a compound annual growth rate of roughly 5% through 2016 off a 2012 base. At FPL, this includes successfully bringing our remaining 2 modernization projects online on time and on budget. It also includes our completed nuclear uprate program, which I mentioned in my opening remarks. At Energy Resources, it includes 175 megawatts of U.S. wind expected to enter service in 2013, roughly 600 megawatts of Canadian wind to enter service through 2015 and approximately 900 megawatts of solar to enter service through 2016. Also included in our March backlog is our Lonestar Transmission project in Texas which, as I noted earlier, is now fully operational. We must stay focused on completing the remaining projects in our backlog while we pursue and execute on new incremental opportunities across our core businesses. Our ability to grow beyond 5% through 2016 will depend in large part on how successful we are in identifying and implementing productivity improvements and on how successful we are in developing new capital deployment opportunities. The internal review I mentioned earlier began this month, and we are working hard to identify opportunities to improve our businesses through O&M savings. At FPL, every dollar we can extract in productivity and O&M savings creates headroom to allow us to invest incremental capital in the business without driving up customer bills. We have already identified $75 million in potential savings through a number of initiatives, and we fully expect to find more. We have also identified $4 billion to $5 billion of incremental capital deployment opportunities at FPL that appear to have strong customer benefits, although more analysis is required before we are ready to commit to all of them. One of these opportunities is accelerated storm hardening that will build on the program we started some time ago to improve our systems' resiliency and reliability. We will be filing updated plans for this additional infrastructure investment with Florida PSC tomorrow. While some of the potential incremental investments will be recovered through clauses or on an AFUDC return, others, such as storm hardening, will be absorbed through productivity improvements and the O&M savings we are able to generate. We have set a stretch goal for ourselves to keep base O&M roughly flat in nominal terms through 2016 at Florida Power & Light. Additional growth at Energy Resources beyond our March backlog will come from new wind and solar projects. As I noted earlier, since the March investor conference, we have signed PPAs for an additional 150 megawatts of new U.S. wind and 40 megawatts of new U.S. solar projects. We have a strong pipeline of additional projects and continue to expect to develop between 500 megawatts and 1,500 megawatts of new contracted U.S. wind and up to 300 megawatts of new contracted solar projects over the next 4 years, equating to an incremental capital investment of somewhere between $1 billion and $4 billion. Based on the opportunities we see over the next 4 years at both FPL and Energy Resources, we continue to expect that our portfolio mix and earnings profile will shift towards a more regulated and long-term contracted business. Maintaining a balanced portfolio is important for our risk profile and our credit position. In 2016, we expect adjusted EBITDA from our regulated and long-term contracted operations to reach roughly 84% of the total. Let me now walk through our results for the first quarter of 2013. We will begin with results at FPL before moving on to Energy Resources and then the consolidated numbers. For the first quarter of 2013, FPL reported net income of $288 million or $0.68 per share, up $0.10 per share year-over-year. The regulatory return on equity during the quarter remained unchanged at 11%. However, the quality of earnings improved, as cash recovery associated with the base rate increase reduced the utilization of reserve amortization as compared to the same quarter last year. We invested roughly $700 million in the quarter and expect to invest approximately $2.8 billion for the full year. Regulatory capital employed growth of roughly 14% over same quarter last year was the main driver of growth in net income of approximately 20%. The remaining difference was a function of a number of smaller items, including improvement in the non-retail portion of the business. We would expect to see our growth in net income generally track our growth in regulatory capital deployed, though there may be differences on a quarter-to-quarter basis. Weather during the quarter was both mild and unusual in nature. The number of heating degree days in January and February was well below normal. And in March, we experienced an abnormally low number of cooling degree days. We estimate that for the quarter, base revenues were roughly $40 million less than we expected, primarily as a result of the weather. We utilized $137 million of surplus depreciation during the quarter, and we remain comfortable that we can achieve our financial expectations this year and still retain sufficient reserve amortization for future years. Looking back over the past 2 years, we have utilized a larger proportion of surplus depreciation in the first half of the year, and we do not expect this year to be any different. As many of you recall, we have been expecting 2013 to require the utilization of more surplus than in subsequent years, and this remains true. 2014 and later years will benefit from the growth of our existing wholesale contracts, and thus, require less reserve amortization to meet our targeted regulatory ROE. All of our major initiatives that we laid out for you in prior quarters remain on track. Turkey Point Unit 4 nuclear uprate, I mentioned earlier, completes the extended power uprate program at FPL. Today, the plant is running at approximately 50%, and when it ramps up to full power in a few more weeks, our uprate program will have added a total of more than 500 megawatts of emissions-free generation to our fleet. I also noted earlier that our Cape Canaveral modernization project is now operational after entering service more than a month ahead of schedule. The project also came in under budget, and we are very pleased by the success of our development and construction effort. The 1,210 megawatts of highly efficient combined-cycle gas generation from the plant will save customers money on fuel, reduce air emissions and start to provide shareholders with a cash return on their substantial investment. Construction continues at our Riviera Beach plant modernization, which is now 53% complete, and the project remains on budget and on schedule to enter service in June 2014. We are also moving ahead with the Port Everglades modernization project, with demolition of the current plant scheduled for July of this year and construction set to begin next spring. Our Port Everglades plant is expected to enter service in June 2016. All in all, our 3 modernization projects will add approximately 3,700 megawatts of efficient, clean, combined-cycle generation to our fleet and are expected to provide roughly 1.2 billion in customer benefits over the lives of the plants. Other developments at FPL during the quarter include progress on our proposed acquisition of the Vero Beach municipal electric utility system. On March 12 of this year, residents voted in favor of the transition, and we expect the transaction to close in 2014. On our pipeline project, we received a number of bids in response to the RFP, and we are in the process of evaluating them now. We expect to make a decision sometime in July and hope to have additional information to provide by our second quarter earnings release. The Florida economy continues to improve slowly. Florida's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in March dropped 1.4 percentage points from the prior year to 7.5%, outpacing the improvement in the national unemployment rate of only 0.6% over the same period. This is the first time since January 2008 that the Florida unemployment rate is lower than the national rate. We are seeing the improving employment picture reflected in retail activity, which has increased markedly since the trough in mid-2009 and is now above prerecession levels. At the same time, Florida consumer confidence is well above the low points reached in recent years and seems to be reasonably stable even after federal budget sequestration and the expiration of the payroll tax holiday. The Florida housing market also continues to recover. The backlog of homes in foreclosure is gradually declining, and Florida has improved from having the second highest mortgage delinquency rates in the country to having the ninth highest rates. The Case-Shiller seasonally adjusted index for South Florida home prices continues to increase at a double-digit pace and is now at the highest level since early 2009. Florida building permits, a leading indicator of residential new service accounts, nearly doubled on an annual basis and remained the second highest in the nation. These generally encouraging developments are reflected in the internal indicators that we follow at FPL. During the first quarter, we had approximately 33,000 more customers than in the comparable quarter in 2012, representing an increase of 0.7%. This growth rate has been fairly consistent for the last 12 quarters. Total retail sales declined 3.5%, as January and February were unusually mild, while March was much cooler than normal. Comparisons with last year are also affected by the leap year impact. Underlying usage was roughly flat for the quarter. The number of inactive meters declined to the lowest number that we have seen in 5 years, and it is now approaching its long-term average. On the other hand, the improvement in low usage accounts seems to have stalled. It may be that partially occupied premises have increased more or less permanently, due to an increase in investor-owned and internationally owned properties. New service accounts are on track for the strongest year since 2009, and we continue to see growth in our industrial accounts which, as a reminder, are primarily tied to the construction industry in our service territory. We remain encouraged by these overall positive data. Let me turn now to Energy Resources, which reported first quarter 2013 GAAP earnings of negative $40 million or negative $0.09 per share. Adjusted earnings for the first quarter were $177 million or $0.42 per share. Adjusted earnings exclude the effect of the mark on non-qualifying hedges and net other than temporary impairments on certain investments, or OTTI. In addition, we have excluded 3 other items from adjusted earnings this quarter. These are the gain on the sale of our Maine hydro assets, a charge associated with the decision to sell our merchant fossil assets in Maine and charges associated with an impairment on our Spain solar project. I'll provide more details on these items in just a moment. Energy Resources' adjusted EPS contribution was slightly negative compared to the same quarter of last year, decreasing $0.02. The primary drivers for the quarter were lower wind generation of $0.06 and PTC roll-off of $0.01, partially offset by the absence of the Seabrook derate we experienced in 2012 of $0.02. Our customer supply and trading businesses contributed a positive $0.04 due to favorable market conditions. New wind and solar investments increased $0.03 over the prior year comparable quarter. Contributions from gas infrastructure declined $0.03, as last year's comparable quarter included a gain associated with hedge closeouts. All other effects were minor as reflected on the accompanying slide. For the full year, we expect to elect CITCs on roughly 300 megawatts for our Mountain View Solar project and portions of Genesis and Desert Sunlight solar projects that are expected to enter service in 2013. This equates to roughly $80 million in adjusted earnings, up from $53 million in 2012 on 457 megawatts of wind projects. While there are fewer megawatts of CITC elections in 2013, the capital costs for solar are higher than capital costs for wind, which results in an increase in earnings for the year-over-year comparison. As I mentioned, we have excluded 3 items from adjusted earnings this quarter due to their unusual nature in order to make period-to-period comparisons more meaningful. However, it is important to understand their impact. The sale of the Maine hydro assets closed during the quarter. And as we previously indicated, the transaction resulted in a significant GAAP gain of $216 million. The sale had a small positive cash impact. Based on changes we have made to our merchant portfolio in the Northeast and our commitment to continuously evaluate the role of all our assets, we have concluded that our Maine fossil assets no longer strategically make sense for the business. We have, therefore, made the decision to sell our 796 megawatts of merchant oil-fired assets in Maine. Based on the estimated fair value, we have recognized a charge of $41 million with no current cash impact. Our Spain project is nearing completion. However, the project is facing financial challenges as a result of recent tariff changes that fundamentally impact the project's economics. After extensive analysis, in accordance with accounting rules, we concluded that the value of our assets should be written down by $300 million. After accounting for certain income tax valuation allowances, which have no impact on cash, the total after-tax impact to GAAP net income is $342 million. However, the economic effect is as we have previously discussed, and we continue to believe that our economic exposure is limited to our equity commitment of somewhat less than $300 million. As a reminder, we have removed from our financial expectations all contributions to operating earnings and cash flow from this project. We continue to make good progress in developing our backlog of renewables projects. Our solar and Canadian wind programs are on track to meet their respective commitments of roughly 600 megawatts of contracted wind capacity in Canada through 2015 and roughly 900 megawatts of contracted solar capacity through 2016. As I mentioned earlier, we are pleased that our 2013 to 2014 wind program is on track, with 325 megawatts of projects with signed long-term PPAs. With the economics of wind improving as a result of better turbine technology and lower turbine prices, wind PPA contracts are very attractively priced. As a result, buyers are clearly interested in taking advantage of these prices and the production tax credit extension. Recently, the IRS clarified the start of construction language necessary to qualify for the PTC. A facility qualifies if significant physical work begins at the site or certain Safe Harbor provisions are met. We view this language as positive. Our solar development pipeline remains on track with the potential to build up to 300 megawatts of incremental projects in addition to the March backlog. As I indicated earlier, we recently secured 2 20-megawatt PPAs and are actively working on additional opportunities in our pipeline. We are pleased with our progress in our development pipeline and remain comfortable with the ranges we have discussed. As a reminder, we indicated in March that we have the potential to deploy $1 billion to $3 billion in incremental capital and add between 500 and 1,500 megawatts of U.S. wind capacity in 2013 and 2014, and we see opportunities for a further up to $1 billion of incremental capital investment to support our target of up to 300 megawatts of new solar projects through to 2016. We will update you each quarter on our progress as we secure PPAs and continue to work our development pipeline. Looking at the company on a consolidated basis. For the first quarter of 2013, NextEra Energy's GAAP net income was $272 million or $0.64 per share. NextEra Energy's 2013 first quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $475 million and $1.12, respectively. Adjusted earnings from the corporate and other segment were up $0.02 compared to the first quarter of 2012, primarily due to consolidating income tax adjustments in our Lone Star Transmission project. As we noted last quarter, we expect the full year contributions to earnings from this segment to improve slightly relative to 2012. On our last earnings call, we laid out for you a list of critical success factors for 2013. These remain a priority for us. At FPL, we'll continue to strive to deliver the best value in the state to our customers. The FPL team had a great year in 2012, and we will focus on ways to make our customer value proposition even better. We will continue to develop the Riviera Beach and Port Everglades modernization projects, with a focus on coming in on time and on budget. And finally, we've made a good start in our effort to identify additional ways to improve productivity, so we can invest capital in projects that will continue to improve the value we deliver to our customers. At Energy Resources, we must maintain our focus on excellence in day-to-day operations. We must continue the successful development of our Canadian wind and our solar portfolios, and we will continue working hard to develop a strong portfolio of profitable contracted solar projects along with our 2013, 2014 U.S. wind program. We expect to finance any incremental investment in a way that supports our targeted credit metrics. And finally, in our transmission business, our focus will be on successfully operating our newly commissioned Lone Star Transmission project and looking for additional transmission opportunities in North America. Based on what we see at this time, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share for 2013 to be in the range of $4.70 to $5, and we see nothing that would change the ranges of earnings expectations we provided you in March for 2014 through 2016. We continue to see adjusted EPS growth at a compound annual growth rate of 5% to 7% through 2016 off a 2012 base. As always, our expectations are subject to the usual caveats we provide, including normal weather and operating conditions. And with that, we will now open the lines for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Dan Eggers with Crédit Suisse.
Dan Eggers - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Just turning to the wind conversation a little bit with the range now out there of 500 to 1,500 for the next 2 years. Is that 1,500 megawatt, the top end number, is that a reflection of kind of the logistical limitations of you guys building that much wind in a short amount of time? Or do you think there's the ability, at some point, to maybe surpass that given the compelling economics of wind with the tax credit still sitting out there?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Well, Dan, I would say that the whole range is based on our total assessment of what's realistic over this period, including both the customer dimension and the supply-chain dimension. So while I would never say never, I think that based on what we see today, 1,500 is a good upper end for the U.S. wind program.
Dan Eggers - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: And then have you thought about kind of the way the IRS interpretation? I mean, it looks like there's maybe some ability to even go beyond 2014 from a development perspective. Do you guys see a window where this could expand into 2015?
Moray P. Dewhurst: I think that right answer to that is just to say that we are very focused on our 2013-2014 program.
Dan Eggers - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And then on solar, obviously, you guys kind of rescaled on the Blythe project, which was expected. But when do you think we could start to see movement on some PPAs being announced on the solar front? Is that a 2013 announcement prospect? And what should we be watching maybe to see some of these projects move forward?
Moray P. Dewhurst: I guess I would just divide the solar pipeline into the 2 parts. I think obviously, with just announcing 2 small projects here, I think there could be several more of those. We've previously noted that there's probably not more than one more large scale project to come that could -- would -- certainly we could have success on that in this year, or not. So I mean it's a little difficult to say exactly when it's going to happen. Armando, do you want -- do you have any other comments? Armando is shaking his head, so that's all we've got.
Dan Eggers - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And I guess just the last one. Again, I guess, it looks like we had a light performance from a wind utilization perspective. A, how far off were you guys versus normal? Because I didn't see it in the slides. And then b, is there a time when we need to reevaluate kind of the growth rate or base line expectations, given the fact that there seems to be a fairly regular underperformance from wind relative to the model?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Well, I guess, there's 2 parts to the answer to that question. First, on the wind resource, just numerically, in the first quarter we're about 97%. It's quite clear looking at the data over the last few years that the wind resource available to the portfolio in aggregate has been, on average, below the longer-term averages. So I don't think there's any question about that. The second part of the answer, however, is that we are right in the midst of essentially recalibrating all our wind models. And the reason that I pulled the wind resource slide from the release this time is that we -- while we have a new set of numbers, they are not directly comparable to the ones that we have been presenting. So I was a little concerned that people would compare one with the other and come to misleading conclusions. So we will be putting those back out once we have a better basis for comparisons on that. So we are doing some recalibration. But I would just estimate -- underline that the wind resource, like any other sort of climate-related variable, can go through quite significant cycles. So we can have several years in a row where you are below average, and that is statistically perfectly normal.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Moray, I had to jump off for a second. But did you say that you expect near [ph] to be slightly improved versus '12?
Moray P. Dewhurst: I think you may have been picking up the reference to corporate and other. As we've previously said, for '13, we expect it to be a little bit up over 2012. We certainly expect Energy Resources to be up as well in '13.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: And I think you filed with Florida that you expected to earn 11.25%. Is that still reasonable?
Moray P. Dewhurst: The forecasted surveillance report for the remainder of the year is -- comes in at about 11.25%. So yes, that's roughly what we're thinking at the moment based on what we see.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: And then lastly, have you initiated discussions in Spain? And what's the outlook for resolution here aside from walking away?
Moray P. Dewhurst: I think as a practical matter it's going to take some time to resolve the situation. We are in active discussion with our bank group. But for commercial reasons, I don't think it would be appropriate for me to say more.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: And I guess, from our current position, the way you've characterized Spain, there's nothing but upside from here. Is that fair?
Moray P. Dewhurst: I can't absolutely say that there's nothing but upside. But as I said in the prepared remarks, we continue to believe that our exposure is limited to the equity contribution, which is roughly $270 million based on today's exchange rate.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Steven Fleishman.
Steven Fleishman: Just a couple questions. The 2013, '14 EBITDAs were down about $100 million to $140 million in -- for Resources. Is that mainly just taking Spain out? Or is there any other changes in there?
Moray P. Dewhurst: There's a few minor changes, but by far the biggest change was removing Spain.
Steven Fleishman: Okay. And then you mentioned the good kind of market conditions for the supply trading. Could you give us maybe a little more color on that? Which business within that benefited?
Moray P. Dewhurst: It was really spread all across the board. The full requirements piece of it was roughly half the $0.04. And even within that, it was a variety of different deals. As I recall, it was mostly concentrated in the PJM deals, more than NEPOOL. But most everything was a little bit better. And then a little bit in just the regular general marketing and trading. So nothing specific that you can really point to, but each element of that portfolio did a little bit better than we expected.
Steven Fleishman: And then retail was fine?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Retail was -- yes. Flat where we expected it to be.
Steven Fleishman: Okay. One other question, just the -- there's, I guess, the proposed legislation on renewable MLP has been -- has come back out again. Could you just give us your latest thoughts on that proposal? What are the good things, bad things and how that ties into whether we can get another PTC extension?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Sure. Let me ask Jim to comment on that one.
James L. Robo: So Steve, I think the important thing to understand about the MLP proposal with -- of adding renewables to be able to be MLP-able, if you will, is that it's not really a replacement for the PTC. And that's because this bill doesn't fix the -- doesn't address the passive loss limitations that exist as a result of the 1986 tax changes. And so new wind projects have significant losses that would not be allocable to the investors. And so it's a terrific vehicle for old wind assets coming off of a 10-year -- coming off of their 10-year PTC window, and that's terrific. And we think as the largest owner of those kind of assets, that it would be helpful to us if it passed. But it is not a replacement for the PTC, is the bottom line, and would not really impact new builds as a result of that.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs.
Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: On the utility, you mentioned the storm hardening program and that you would make a filing tomorrow. But that -- and I wanted to make sure I understood this, that you wouldn't be seeking full recovery via a rider. Could you just give a little more granularity about what's recovered via rider? What you would kind of utilize AFUDC earnings to capture for the next few years. And then when would you put this into cash rates?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Sure. Let me try and see if I can take those. First of all, we have a requirement for an annual filing with the commission on our storm hardening plans, and that is, I believe, this week. We will be indicate -- based on the work that we've done to date, we can see very significant benefits from the hardening activities that we've already undertaken. And so we would like, if we can, to accelerate our rate of progress on that, and we believe that we will be able to do that and that will be the effect of the filing tomorrow. For recovery purposes, given the fixed rate agreement, the -- that has to be absorbed within the fixed rates that we can see out through 2016. In terms of ultimate cash recovery, it would be then obviously part of the rate base that would go into whatever we end up doing for 2017. Let's say, hypothetically, we had a rate case in 2017, it would be in the rate base on which the revenue requirement would be assessed. Broadly speaking, what we typically call our base infrastructure-type investments, so that's the basic investment that we have to do in the transmission/distribution infrastructure. All the sort of basic, outside of major generation projects, would typically have to be absorbed within the fixed rate agreement that we have in place. If there are specific large projects that are approved by the commission within this period, they would become eligible for AFUDC, so you would have an earnings impact but a noncash impact, potentially, within this period, but we'd have to wait for cash recovery beyond. So the projects that clearly get cash recovery through increases in rates in the period of the rate agreement are the 3 modernization projects. Then there are some projects that might be recovered through clauses. So if there were a capital investment that was associated with environmental upgrades that were authorized for recovery through the environmental clause, for example, those would get cash recovery through that mechanism. So there's a whole variety of things. But I think the bottom line way to think about this is the reason that we are so very focused on productivity is that the more progress we can make on the productivity side, not only do we make the business better in and of itself, but we also create what I call the headroom to enable us to do additional capital activities that are good for customer and will provide long-term value creation potential for the shareholder.
Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Got it. One other piece, just on O&M at the utility. Year-over-year O&M was down a good bit. Just I didn't know if there were onetimey items -- onetimer items in the 2012 quarter? Or just could you give a little detail there?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Yes. As always, with O&M, there are some significant variations from quarter-to-quarter. So some of that effect is timing. But some of it is related to planned outages, which vary from year to year. But having said that, as I said before, we are very focused on the broader O&M picture. We have this company-wide initiative underway, and we feel pretty good about where we are on that long-term stretch goal of keeping O&M flat in nominal terms over the period of the rate agreement.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Most of my questions have been asked and answered. But I wanted to follow up on one question from Dan on this April 15 IRS -- I guess, I'm not sure what the official term is, but the IRS letter or whatever, in terms of the PTCs and the ITCs. I know you guys are focused on this year and next, but could you just give us a little bit of flavor as to your reading of the IRS language and what that might mean for the industry in terms of 2015 in terms of new wind potential for the industry?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Frankly, we haven't focused much thought or time on what the implication is for 2015. I think -- at least the way we see it, we have a great window of opportunity to build another portfolio of U.S. wind in 2013 and 2014. And the sooner that we can get projects underway, the sooner we can get them completed, deliver benefits to our customers and value to our shareholders. So we really, at this stage, haven't been focused on 2015.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.
Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Most of my questions have also been asked and answered, but one on just customer load growth. In the first quarter, it looks like the change in underlying usage was basically flat. And last year, I think it was up a little over 1%. And in your Analyst Day, you had laid out some expectations there. Can you talk a little bit more about the drivers for the first quarter, how you look at that versus your expectations?
Moray P. Dewhurst: We don't attach a great deal of significance to any one quarter's change in the underlying usage per customer. Last year, we were, I think, pleasantly surprised. We had several quarters where we thought it was higher than sustainable. So this one is kind of a little bit lower than we would expect for the medium-term outlook. But I can't put my finger on any particular drivers in there. It does fluctuate a fair amount from quarter-to-quarter. So going forward, I still think we're going to see small positive increases in average usage per customer over the next few years. But in any quarter, we could be up by a 1% or flat to slightly down as we were this quarter.
Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay, because -- so it sounds like within customer classes, different class, so you didn't see any one class that really stuck out to you as being different than expectations.
Moray P. Dewhurst: No, nothing that's not within the normal bands of noise for these data series.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Greg Gordon with ISI Group.
Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Just a couple things. In the projection that you'll earn the -- around 11.25% ROE on a regulatory basis for the year, does that projection take into account the expectation that you will in fact achieve 0 base O&M growth for the fiscal year?
Moray P. Dewhurst: I think the short answer is yes. It certainly reflects our current expectation on O&M for the year. I'm having trouble recalling exactly what that is for this year. But clearly, the range that's in this forecasted surveillance report includes our current thinking about O&M for this year, and that certainly won't be significantly off from last year.
Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Awesome. And so just to recap what you said with regard to the ability to sort of earn on the storm hardening portion of sort of your opportunity set in terms of incremental opportunities for between now and '16. By definition, you see the ability to hold O&M flat is creating the headroom for sort of that tranche of potential opportunities should the commission accept them?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Absolutely, yes. Now recognize that most of that, the headroom, needs to be created in future years because most of that spending will ramp up this year and the higher levels will be attained next year. But absolutely, yes.
Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then in the next rate cycle, all of that would get rolled into the rate proceeding?
Moray P. Dewhurst: That's correct.
Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Okay, great. Last question, you talked about how the surplus depreciation in the quarter was $137 million. You talked about using more in the first half than the second half. Then you said that surplus depreciation use would decline in subsequent years but the impact of that would be mitigated and/or offset, I don't remember the exact language, by increases in wholesale revenues from contracts coming on. Can you talk about the size and duration of those contracts?
Moray P. Dewhurst: I don't think I can say anything very specific about the duration. We did have some discussion, in the March investor conference there's a slide that, I don't recall exact numbers right now, but does show you the magnitude of the impact in 2014. But we have a significant pickup in 2014 associated with one large contract.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.
Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Just curious on the wind resource update that you talked about. And I think you had mentioned a number of 97%. Is that on the new basis, so therefore not comparable with, I think, it was 101 [ph] in Q1 last year? Or is that given all...
Moray P. Dewhurst: Yes. Thank you, Jonathan. I should have pointed that out. Yes, that is the current best thinking about what the actual wind resources relative to long-term normal trends. So not directly comparable to the prior materials.
Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: So that's the only number we have so far on the new series basically?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Yes. It's just going to take us a little bit longer. We've had -- some of the same people have been involved in certain quarter closing activities, which have set us behind where I had hoped we would be on that, but we will get that out soon.
Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: And could you give us any sort of sense, I guess, on the old basis, like the year 2012 was 6% below normal or 94%. Is the new normal similar to 2012? Or is it less significant than that?
Moray P. Dewhurst: No. The fundamental difference in the recalibration is -- the simple way to think about it is we are recalibrating how much of the output we really think is driven by variability in wind resource as opposed to variation in other factors, including asset availability, curtailments and a variety of other things. There was just kind of a little tweak going on there. And in short, we think, looking back, we've actually been over-attributing shortfalls to wind resource.
Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: So operating, the reliability has been slightly less good, I guess.
Moray P. Dewhurst: Yes. And let me give you -- there are lots of instances here, but let me give you one little one, but it turns out to be significant. Each of these turbines has to be aligned to the average wind direction, and the alignment of the turbine instantaneously to the average wind direction has an impact on the power extraction. So in order to do that, you have to have a vein, essentially, on the turbine that allows the control system to figure out where the wind is coming from, to allow the control system to align the turbine optimally with the wind. If those veins are slightly out of alignment, and they do have a tendency to get out of alignment over time for various reasons, then you will have the control system not optimally extracting the wind. So we've had a recent program where we have been going through and realigning some of these little veins. So that may sound like a small item, but being off by a couple degrees, which you wouldn't notice off a regular visional inspection, can make a difference. So there's a whole series of things like that. And we'll have more for you on that, but I felt we couldn't deal with that within the context of the earnings release.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: So first question. You spent a lot of time at the Analyst Day or at least the presentation on transmission opportunities. I'd be very curious to get your thoughts on FERC 1000, how the compliance filings are working out and, as of today, what the opportunity set before you by region is.
Moray P. Dewhurst: Sure, I'd ask Armando to comment more. But generally speaking, we're getting actually more encouraged that more transmission opportunities may be opening up to competition, which we think will give us some opportunities. But Armando?
Armando Pimentel: And that would have been my first remark, which is FERC Order 1000 is working. It may work a bit slow and it may work a bit different by the regions, but it's clearly working. I mean, we've seen opportunities come up this year in California. Opportunities come up in ISO New England. We're excited about some things that we're looking at in SPP. And it's -- so it's one of those things where I look at where we have -- we look at -- we have the pipeline today compared to where it was a couple years ago, and it's pretty exciting. But as we talked about at the Analyst Day, it's not just the U.S. opportunities or the 48 states. We've got several opportunities up in Canada that we're pursuing, a bid that we put in earlier this year that we expect to hear back in the third quarter. Hawaii looks like it might have some opportunities if those -- that RFP comes out in the second or third quarter of this year. So as you might imagine, the incumbent utilities have a significant interest in what happens in their home territory and would like to build the transmission themselves, but we see continued opportunities. And in some regions and states, none of which I'll mention at this time, it actually looks like even the state regulators are pushing the traditional utilities to be a bit more open and either seek partners or to open up the opportunity entirely to new incumbents. So that's pretty exciting for us also.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Absolutely. And just putting pen to pad here, when do you think we'd hear more definitive or concrete plans around the transmission opportunities outside of Texas?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Well, Julien, I was just going to say, just to put all this in context, as a reminder, what we have said is the transmission opportunities that we're working are the projects that are likely to come into service in the 2017, 2018 kind of time frame. So these are long-term projects. In addition, I have certainly indicated to a number of people that my -- I personally would be delighted if we could, sometime in the course of the next 12 months, find that we have succeeded on one of a half dozen or so realistic opportunities that we have. So I think we have the possibility that sometime in the next 12 months, we would have a project to announce. But even if we do, it would be a project that won't have an earnings impact until well out into the latter half of the decade. But that's fine, because we feel very good about where we are through the middle of the decade.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Great. And then bringing it a little bit nearer term here. Looking at New England in the quarter, obviously, you have some assets up there, I suppose a fossil asset that you're looking to get rid of. To what extent did that operate? How did that impact your results? And how do you think about the uplift we've seen at Algonquin of late?
Moray P. Dewhurst: The answer to how much is operated is very, very little for a long time. Recognize, these are oil-fired assets. So they are essentially oil-fired peakers in today's environment. And obviously, with the gas/oil spread being where it is, that has meant they have just not operated a great deal. So their impact on operating earnings and cash flow really immaterial. But the more fundamental thing is now in light of the structure of the remaining assets in New England, which has really fundamentally been reduced to a merchant position at Seabrook and one minor other asset, they really -- they didn't fit into -- they didn't play a role in the portfolio. So that was the reason for making the decision to discontinue operations there and seek a purchaser.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Hugh Wynne with Sanford Bernstein.
Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: You had mentioned that you expected a continued positive trend in weather-normalized use per customer. And I think in your Analyst Day presentation, that was forecasted about 0.3% to 0.7% CAGR. What, in your view, are the drivers of a positive trend as opposed to a negative trend in response to the phase-out of traditional incandescent bulbs and a tendency towards greater efficiency in climate controls in commercial buildings, residential and commercial customers comprising the bulk of your load?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Hugh, I guess there are couple of things. First, you've got, I would say, cyclical factors. We are still coming back from a period where average usage per customer was actually down relative to long-term averages. Second, you've got long-term secular factors, which tend to drive modest increases, and then -- and I'll come back to those in the moment. And then third, you've got -- those are offset by the factors you mentioned, the efficiency thing. So we have an explicit view of the impact of efficiency standards, which are primarily in the HVAC and lighting areas. But that middle category, the sort of long-term drivers of growth, it's fundamentally the long-term economic development. For a long period of time, we have seen that as people get more money, they tend to end up with larger houses, more electronic devices, they tend to feel a little more free to turn the thermostat down to be comfortable, all of those kinds of things. And for certainly as long as we've been looking at the statistics, Florida has exceeded the U.S. average in terms of long-run growth in usage per customer. So I guess the bottom line answer is we're not expecting to go back to the levels of growth that we saw in the last decade because we do believe that those efficiency, appliance efficiency standards will have more of an impact. But when you couple some underlying long-term growth with a little bit still of recovery from the depressed consumption associated with the recession, we think somewhere in that 0.5% a year over several years is realistic.
Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Great. And if I could quickly, on the stretch target of achieving basically flat O&M expense per megawatt hour over the '13, '14, '15, '16 period, that implies a fairly substantial cut in real O&M per megawatt hour. Is that something that's made possible by the rollout of your automated metering system? Or are there other more important drivers that make you think that, that's feasible?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Well, I would say I would -- I certainly wouldn't exclude that. We are definitely seeing all kinds of opportunities from -- arising from the investment that we've made in the so-called smart grid. But that's only one of many things. Look, if you go back and look at the long-term trend, we have consistently, up through the middle of the last decade, driven real O&M per kilowatt hour down substantially. That trend started to reverse a little bit or flattened out in the middle of the last decade, and then it reversed a bit with the -- as we went through the recession in the last few years. So really what we're saying to ourselves is we ought to be able to get back on the track of long-term, real improvement in O&M per kilowatt hour over a multiyear period. And now that we have the resources, many of which were freed up from the completion of the rate case last year, to focus on the analytical work that's necessary to get us there and the ideas that are coming up through this initiative that I referred to, we feel pretty good that we can get back to where we think we should be.
Operator: And we'll take our final question from Ashar Khan with Visium.
Ashar Khan: Moray, can you give us what -- on the slide where you showed what the first quarter rate base was, is there a number that you can provide us that would be for the end of 2013?
Moray P. Dewhurst: I can certainly get back to you on that. We have a rough number on where we expect to be given the CapEx plans. I don't have it off the top of my head. But yes, I can get back to you on that. Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. We thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the NextEra Energy Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Julie Holmes, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Julie Holmes: Thank you, Anne. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2012 earnings conference call. With me this morning are Jim Robo, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; Moray Dewhurst, NextEra Energy's Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer; Armando Pimentel, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources; and Eric Silagy, President of Florida Power and Light. Moray will provide an overview of our results, following which, our executive team will be available to answer your questions. We will be making forward-looking statements during today's call. These statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release, in the comments made during this conference call, in the risk factor section of the accompanying presentation or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website, nexteraenergy.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. Please also note that today's presentation includes references to adjusted earnings and adjusted EBITDA, which are non-financial GAAP measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying this presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of the non-GAAP measure to the closest GAAP financial measure. With that, I will turn the call over to Moray.
Moray P. Dewhurst: Thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy delivered solid financial results in 2012, and both principal businesses executed on the objectives we set for ourselves and shared with you in 2011. The progress we made across both major businesses this past year reinforces our growth prospects through the middle of the decade. We also began to devote significant effort to projects that will drive our growth in the second half of the decade. Throughout the year, we indicated that we were focused on execution, and I'm pleased to note that we met all our principal execution objectives. At FPL, we continued to deliver the best customer value in the state, our major capital projects all progressed well and we successfully resolved our base rate case. At Energy Resources, we completed our record backlog of U.S. wind projects and met our milestones for the development of our Canadian wind portfolio and our solar portfolio. We also had good execution in our day-to-day operations with a strong finish to the year. And finally, construction of our Lone Star Transmission line continued, and we remain on track for the start of operations later this quarter. All in all, it was a very strong year that positions us well for the future. Before discussing the financial results, I'd like to take a few minutes to highlight what we accomplished in 2012. At FPL, our strategy is founded upon offering the best customer value in the state and on finding ways to improve our value delivery over time. 2012 was an excellent year in this respect. We maintained our position as a service provider offering the lowest typical residential bills among all 55 utilities in Florida and a bill that is 26% below the national average. We had our best year ever in terms of overall transmission and distribution reliability. And for the ninth year in a row, FPL received the prestigious ServiceOne award for outstanding customer service. FPL also improved its national ranking in the ongoing J.D. Power & Associates Residential Customer Satisfaction Survey and retained its top ranking in Florida. In terms of reliability, we continued to rank in the top quartile nationally, and our 5-year average for the System Average Interruption Duration Index or SAIDI was the lowest among all Florida investor-owned utilities for the period 2007 to 2011. Looking forward, we believe we can improve our performance further. In 2012, we continued to improve the electric grid through our Energy Smart Florida program, including the installation of another 1.5 million smart meters throughout the state, bringing the cumulative total today to approximately 4.3 million. The project is now 96% complete and will serve as the platform for future reliability and customer service enhancements. Through realtime access to data at the meter, FPL can now better detect and prevent outages and restore service faster when outages do occur. Data is also available to customers through an energy dashboard available online and via mobile device, which is designed to help them monitor energy consumption and make more informed decisions about their usage. Making our service the most affordable in the state depends fundamentally on our cost position. For many years, we have been a top decile performer in terms of non-fuel O&M, and we estimate, based on benchmarking data, that every year, our customers save roughly $1.6 billion as a consequence of our low-cost position compared with typical utility performance. That translates to an annual savings for a typical residential customer of about $200. While we have been very successful over the last several years in keeping the real escalation rate of O&M down, we have seen some upward pressure on nominal O&M per kilowatt hour, as shown in the upper right chart. With the 4-year horizon of the new rate agreement in place, we will, of course, be very focused on finding ways to improve the cost trend. Consistent with our strategy, we will be searching, not only for additional ways to improve productivity, but also possibilities for deploying capital that lead to cost savings that will benefit our customers and help keep rates low for the long term. Our focus on cost includes more than just O&M, of course, and for the past several years, we have been making major strides in improving the overall efficiency of our generation fleet. In 2012, FPL's fossil fuel fleet reached a record level of efficiency, bringing our systemwide heat rate down to 7,669 British thermal units per kilowatt hour or roughly 24% better than the industry average of 10,040 BTUs per kilowatt hour for 2011, the most recent year for which data is available. Since 2001, FPL's heat rate has improved by 20%. And in 2012 alone, that translated into customer savings of more than $400 million in fuel costs, as we generate more power while using less fossil fuel. In 2012, we invested more than $4 billion at FPL, with more than $830 million of this associated with our 3 modernizations. Our Cape Canaveral project is now 96% complete and is currently on schedule and under our original budget, with an expected in-service date of June 2013. The Riviera Beach modernization is 35% complete and is running on time and on budget, with an expected in-service date of June 2014. We continue to expect to bring the modernized Port Everglades plant into service in June 2016, with demolition of the existing plant currently planned for the second quarter of this year. Together, the 3 modernized plants provide significant customer benefits of more than $1 billion over their operational lifetimes. Turning to our nuclear portfolio. We have now completed 3 of our 4 plant extended power upgrades, investing roughly $3 billion to date and adding approximately 395 megawatts of clean, emissions-free energy to our fleet. The final uprate at Turkey Point Unit 4 is expected to come online in spring 2013 and add roughly 120 megawatts of capacity. Our third major execution imperative for 2012 at FPL was to achieve a satisfactory outcome of our base rate case. Following lengthy negotiations between FPL and key intervener groups and an extensive evidentiary process on the resulting settlement, in December, the commission approved a modified version of our proposed base rate settlement agreement that we believe is fair and reasonable for both customers and shareholders. The agreement is effective through December 2016 and provides for a retail base revenue increase of $350 million and an allowed regulatory ROE at 10.5% with 100 basis point band. The agreement also includes the ability to amortize over the 4 year term up to a combined $400 million of the remaining surplus depreciation credit and a portion of the fossil dismantlement reserve. An important aspect of the agreement provides the base rate increases to recover the capital and operating costs of the modernizations at Cape Canaveral, Riviera Beach and Port Everglades once these plants enter service. This generation base rate adjustment or GBRA mechanism provides an appreciable amount of certainty to both customers and shareholders and removes the expense and risk associated with multiple regulatory proceedings and regulatory lag. Overall, the agreement is designed to help FPL continue to provide customers with exceptional reliability, award-winning customer service and the lowest electric bills in the state for at least 4 more years. On January 2, the retail base rate increase went into effect, and yet bills for the typical FPL residential customer decreased $0.37 per month. This is primarily due to a reduction in the customer fuel charge, which is a function, not only of lower fuel prices, but also of our efforts to reduce fuel consumption through improved efficiencies. The Office of Public Counsel opposed the settlement even with the revisions suggested by the PSC and may appeal their decision. However, we believe the PSC's decision was well reasoned and that the Commission was well within its proper authority to consider and vote to approve the agreement. Turning now to Energy Resources. As we told you last year, we expected headwinds from above market, hedge roll-offs and PTC roll-offs to negatively impact 2012 results. Yet in spite of these challenges, we grew our adjusted earnings over the prior year and laid the groundwork for more pronounced growth in the years to come. We set an aggressive goal for additions to our U.S. wind portfolio in 2012, and through the diligence and hard work of the entire wind team, we exceeded it. We commissioned roughly 1,500 megawatts of wind in the U.S., something no other company has ever achieved. In the fourth quarter alone, we brought online 1,263 megawatts of wind projects. We celebrated the commissioning of Energy Resources' 10,000th megawatt of wind in December, a fleet size which is comparable to the generation capacity at a top 15 utility. We are on track to add approximately 600 megawatts of new Canadian wind by the end of 2015. The majority of which will come into service in 2014, with a total capital commitment of roughly $1.8 billion. And we continue to expect to add nearly 900 megawatts of contracted solar capacity primarily in the U.S. between now and the end of 2016. As we look ahead to the balance of this year and next for Energy Resources, we are evaluating the growth prospects for our wind business following the extension of the production tax credit. While we must now wait for the exact rules that will define "start of construction," the shift from the prior in-service by the end of the year requirement is clearly positive. As we have previously indicated, 2013 will be a down year for new wind compared to 2012 as it will take time for the wind supply chain to gear up, but we are optimistic that we can complete some additional megawatts, and we look forward to a stronger 2014 for new installations. We will continue to work with other supporters on a longer-term approach to the policy framework guiding new renewables development. Before leaving the highlights for Energy Resources, I'd like to draw your attention to Slide 8, which highlights the shifting mix in the earnings profile of the business. Our focus in recent years has been on expansion of our investment in assets with long-term contracts, and more than 80% of our growth capital in the last 5 years has been allocated to these investments. In addition, we have refocused our portfolio in response to changing market conditions, reducing our merchant and short-term contracted assets. The result is a very substantial shift in mix. In 2014, we expect 65% of Energy Resources adjusted EBITDA to come from long-term contracted assets, up from 49% in 2009. Over the same time period, the contribution from the merchant segment is expected to decline from 40% to 20%, while the contribution from all our other businesses, which includes all our customer supply and training activities, as well as our gas infrastructure operations, is expected to remain roughly flat as a proportion of the total at about 10% to 15%. Let me now walk through our results for the quarter and the full year. We will begin with results at FPL, and then discuss Energy Resources in the consolidated numbers. For the fourth quarter of 2012, FPL reported net income of $256 million or $0.61 per share, up $0.10 per share year-over-year. For the full year, FPL reported net income of $1.2 billion or $2.96 per share, up $0.41 per share versus 2011. Throughout 2012, we continued to invest heavily in infrastructure projects to improve overall customer value. As I noted earlier, FPL's capital expenditures exceeded $4 billion, the highest level of annual investment ever. As a direct result, our regulatory capital employed grew 16.4% year-over-year, and this translated to net income growth of 16.1%. During the quarter, we amortized $117 million of surplus depreciation, enabling us to maintain a regulatory return on equity of 11%. For the full year, we amortized $480 million. As a result, at the end of 2012, there remained $224 million of the original $895 million, and we will be able to amortize this over the 4-year term of our base rate settlement agreement. In addition, we will be able to use a maximum of $176 million of the fossil dismantlement reserve during the settlement period. As you may recall, under the terms of the 2010 settlement, the ability to amortize surplus depreciation was central to our ability to maintain our regulatory ROE at the top of the range over the term of the agreement. As we begin operating under the current settlement agreement, the situation is a bit different. In order to earn above the midpoint under the settlement agreement, we will have to work hard to find ways to improve productivity and efficiency. As we've demonstrated in the past, we are committed to doing this. Despite some bumps along the way, we saw continued progress in Florida's economic recovery over the year. Florida's seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate in December was down slightly versus the prior month and was 1.9 percentage points lower than December 2011. The gap between the Florida and U.S. unemployment rates has narrowed significantly since this time last year, from 1.4% in December 2011 to 0.2% in December 2012, with Florida adding roughly 55,000 jobs since December 2011. We also continued to see the housing market in Florida recover some ground lost during the recession. Mortgage delinquency rates have declined substantially from their recession peak, although they remain high by historical standards. And the inventory of existing homes continues to decline. The number of building permits in Florida continued to increase throughout the year and is well above the prior year's level. The Case-Shiller Index for South Florida shows home prices up 8.5% from the prior year, the largest increase since September 2006. All in all, the Florida economy is clearly recovering, though it is not yet as strong as we would all hope for. As we discussed throughout the year, we are seeing most of our customer metrics at FPL gradually improve. Underlying usage per customer decreased 0.5% compared to the same quarter last year. But as we have indicated on previous earnings calls, this metric can be somewhat volatile on a quarterly basis, so we do not attach too much significance to this quarter's slight decline. For the full year, underlying usage per customer grew 1.2% compared to 2011. During the quarter, the percentage of low usage customers declined to the lowest level in 4 years. The number of inactive accounts also continued to decline. In December, new service accounts increased year-over-year, and we saw the highest levels of growth since early 2007 in our industrial accounts, which in our service territory are primarily tied to the construction industry. We view this as a strong indication that the rebound in new construction is gaining traction that will lead to further increases in new service accounts in future quarters. During the fourth quarter, we also saw the largest increase of customer since early 2008, with approximately 34,000 more customers than in the comparable quarter of 2011, representing an increase of 0.8%. Overall, we are seeing moderate improvement in our customer data and continue to believe that Florida will experience above-average growth over the long term. As customer demand grows and fleets across the state shift to more natural gas-fired generation, Florida's natural gas needs will increase significantly. We recognize that this means that there will be a corresponding increase in the need for more natural gas infrastructure to support the increased consumption. Since the current infrastructure does not provide the necessary redundancy and reliability to support growing natural gas requirements, in December, we issued an RFP for a third major natural gas pipeline to serve Florida. The RFP requests 400,000 MMBtu per day of natural gas capacity for Florida beginning in 2017 and an additional 200,000 MMBtu per day beginning in May 2020. The pipeline will consist of 2 segments. The first or upstream portion will run from Western Alabama to a new hub in Central Florida that will interconnect with all major existing Florida pipelines. This portion will access the abundant onshore natural gas resources, helping reduce reliance on offshore resources, which can be disrupted by tropical weather. The second or downstream segment will run from the Central Florida hub to connect with FPL's Martin County plant. Total capital expenditures have not yet been determined, and the specific routes will be selected and proposed by companies submitting bids. As part of the process, NextEra Energy expects to offer a self-build option for the downstream portion of the project and is prepared to consider investing in support of the selected upstream option to facilitate timely construction. We expect to begin evaluating proposals during the second quarter of this year, with construction expected to be completed in 2017. Before moving on to our discussion of results at Energy Resources, I'd like to take a moment to review the 2012 hurricane season. Every year, FPL service territory is at risk of damage and severe service interruptions associated with tropical weather, and 2012 was no exception. We experienced the effects of 4 tropical systems this season, Beryl, Debbie, Isaac and Sandy. In each case, we restored power to more than 90% of affected customers within 24 hours. In addition, our crew spent significant time out of state assisting with power restoration in other parts of the country, including along the Eastern seaboard for those affected by Sandy. Roughly 1,000 of our employees and contractors supported the Sandy restoration effort for several weeks. We are grateful for the support that others have given us over the years, and we were fortunate to be in a position to assist other utilities this past year. Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported fourth quarter 2012 GAAP earnings of $171 million or $0.41 per share. Adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter were $175 million or $0.42 per share. Adjusted earnings exclude the effect of the mark on non-qualifying hedges and net other than temporary impairments on certain investments, or OTTI, and for 2011, the after-tax loss on the sale of the natural gas-fired generating assets. For the full year 2012, Energy Resources reported GAAP earnings of $687 million or $1.64 per share. Adjusted earnings were $693 million or $1.66 per share, up $0.04 from the prior year. We are pleased to see this growth given the difficult environment in 2012. We expect to see more substantial growth in 2013 as some of the headwinds experienced in 2012 begin to subside and our new investments begin to contribute meaningfully to earnings. Energy Resources' contribution to adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter improved $0.12 from last year, primarily due to contributions from new investments of $0.06. Gas infrastructure contributed $0.04 from increased investment, and asset sales and restructuring contributed $0.03 over the same period last year. All other effects were minor. As we've indicated in the past, we continually evaluate our assets and the value each contributes to our portfolio compared with the value the market assigns, and 2012 was no different. We had a few small transactions which contributed $0.03, as I just mentioned. Late in the year, we announced a more significant transaction, the sale of our main hydro assets, which is expected to close later in the first quarter. These assets were financed in 2007, at which time, we recovered the capital invested in them, with the result of their book base was significantly reduced. We would, therefore, expect to record a significant GAAP gain in net income when the transaction closes. But the transaction is not expected to have a material impact on 2013 and ongoing adjusted earnings. The sale of these assets is consistent with our focus on shifting the Energy Resources portfolio mix towards more contracted assets. For the full year 2012, the $0.04 increase in adjusted EPS was driven by several factors. Contributions from our new investments increased $0.22, with $0.04 coming from an increase in CITCs. We elected CITCs for roughly 455 megawatts of wind projects in 2012 compared to approximately 275 megawatts in 2011. The contribution from our customer supply and trading businesses increased $0.11 over the prior year, as both businesses recovered from a difficult 2011. The absence of impairment charges that negatively affected 2011 results added $0.08 to our full year comparisons. And for the full year, gas infrastructure's contribution to adjusted EPS increased $0.06, primarily as a result of additional investment. These positives were largely offset by lower contributions from existing investment in 2012. More than half is related to above market hedge roll-offs and PTC roll-offs that we first discussed with you back in the third quarter of 2011. We expect the impact from both of these factors to decrease in 2013 and 2014. Wind resource, well below the long term average, negatively affected the comparison to last year by $0.08. And finally, reflected in the chart here is a negative comparison of $0.03 associated with the assets sold late in 2011. However, I should note that this presentation does not reflect the full impact of the asset sales, which also had an indirect effect through adjustment of our capital structure. Including the full impact, we estimate that the net effect of the asset sales is several cents accretive for 2012 and beyond. Interest, G&A and all other items totaled a negative $0.12 impact, primarily reflecting continued growth in the business. Looking forward, we expect to elect CITCs on roughly 300 megawatts of new solar generation in 2013. And as we did last year, we have included a summary in the appendix to the presentation that compares our realized equivalent EBITDA to the ranges we provided in the third quarter of 2011. As I mentioned earlier, we achieved an important milestone at our company and across the industry by placing our 10,000th megawatt of wind into service during the fourth quarter of 2012. We also reached production levels of almost 26 million megawatt hours during 2012, the highest level in company history. Although for the year, the wind resource was below normal at 94%, our capacity factor was just slightly below what we reported in 2011 when wind resource was near the long term average. We continued to use more modern, higher efficiency turbines on our new projects in order to improve our wind fleet's performance over time. In 2013 and 2014, we're expecting the average capacity factor to increase as we see the full year benefits from new 2012 wind turbines enhance fleet performance. Over the roughly 26 million megawatt hours of production, approximately 61% were eligible for PTCs. The remainder represents our -- primarily from projects on which we elected CITCs or from projects that have passed their 10-year window of eligibility for PTCs. Approximately 41% of the PTCs generated were allocated to investors under the differential membership interest or tax equity partnerships we have entered into that allow us to monetize the tax benefits from our renewables projects more efficiently. As shown on this slide, the percentage of PTCs allocated to investors grew in 2012, and we expect that proportion to continue to grow to between 45% and 50% in 2013 as we see the full year impact of our 2012 tax equity partnerships flow through. Before I move to the consolidated results, let me note a couple of disclosure items. In our year end 2012 GAAP financial statements, we've made certain reclassifications of benefits and costs associated with differential membership interests which provide more transparency around the accounting for these transactions. You will see changes in the line items where these types of transactions flow through our financial statements in an updated presentation entitled Accounting for Differential Membership Interests. We will be happy to follow up with anyone who has questions after reviewing. Additionally, we recently began posting monthly updates to our Wind Resource Index. Both documents can be found in the Earnings & Supplements section of our Investor Relations website under Business Updates. Looking at the company on a consolidated basis. For the fourth quarter of 2012, NextEra Energy's GAAP net income was $429 million or $1.02 per share. NextEra Energy's 2012 fourth quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $433 million and $1.03, respectively. For the full year 2012, the company's GAAP net income was $1.9 billion or $4.56 per share, adjusted earnings were approximately $1.9 billion or $4.57 per share. As we noted last year, the corporate and other segment benefited from a gain in consolidated income tax adjustments in 2011, which we did not expect to recur. For the full year 2012, on an adjusted basis, the corporate and other segment was down $0.27 from 2011. Looking ahead, we expect annual contributions to earnings from this segment to improve slightly relative to 2012 as earnings from our Lone Star business increase, but are offset by residual interest and taxes. The Lone Star construction program in Texas is progressing as planned, and we continue to expect to bring the line into full service in the spring of 2013. 2012 marked NextEra Energy's biggest year of capital investment ever for both FPL and Energy Resources, far exceeding our internally generated cash flows. Including amounts needed to meet debt maturities, our treasury team executed on more than $7 billion worth of financing transactions across a wide range of capital sources. These were designed to meet our capital needs while also supporting our balance sheet and credit strength, which are central to our business strategies. In addition to a variety of conventional debt issuances, we continued to make use of project debt to support growth at Energy Resources, and we also sold additional differential membership interests to efficiently utilize tax credits generated by new wind projects. We also issued $1.25 billion of equity units to ensure we have the equity support needed during this transitional period of high capital expenditures. These will convert to straight common equity in 2015, at which time they will be integrated into our ongoing financing program. We have previously indicated that we expected 2012 to be the peak year of strain on our balance sheet and we continued to expect a significant shift in our cash flow profile to commence this year. Depending on our success in finding additional investment opportunities and their associated capital needs, we expect our free cash flow deficit in 2013, net of dividend payments, to be on the order of $1 billion or so compared with approximately $6 billion in 2012. We continue to expect our 2014 operating cash flow position to improve further. Based on our continuing shift towards a more regulated and contracted portfolio mix, we continue to believe a dividend payout ratio of 55% in 2014 makes sense, which implies an annual growth rate of approximately 10% over the next 2 years. Of course, all dividend decisions are the responsibility of the board. In light of the results achieved year-to-date and the progress made against our execution objectives, we continue to be comfortable with the 2014 adjusted EPS expectations we shared with you last fall of $5.05 to $5.65 per share. With FPL's rate case settlement case in place, we are now able to provide initial expectations for 2013. As we discussed last quarter, at Energy Resources, we expect 2013 adjusted earnings to be in the range of $740 million to $780 million. Together with FPL's contribution, we expect NextEra Energy adjusted earnings for the full year to be in the range of $4.70 to $5 per share. While the quarterly profile of our earnings will, of course, vary from year to year, looking back over the last decade, the first and fourth quarters have generally each accounted for 18% to 20% or so of the annual total, with the second and third together generally accounting for 55% to 60%. At this early point in the year, we do not see any obvious driver of an unusual pattern for this year. As always, our expectations are subject to the usual caveats we provide, including normal weather and operating conditions. Before taking your questions, let me conclude with a summary of our key areas of focus for 2013. At FPL, we continue to strive to deliver the best value in the state to our customers. The FPL team had a great year in 2012, and we will focus on ways to make our customer value proposition even better. We will continue to focus on our portfolio of large construction projects, with the last of the 4 nuclear uprates due to complete in the spring and the commercial operations at Cape Canaveral slated for the middle of the year. And third, we have already started the process of seeking to identify additional ways we can invest capital in projects that improve the value we deliver to our customers. We have generated a number of ideas already, and we look forward to sharing with you more of our thoughts at our March investor conference. At Energy Resources, we must maintain our focus on excellence in day-to-day operations. We must continue the successful development of our Canadian wind and our solar portfolios. And third, with the short-term extension of the PTC program, we will be working hard to develop a strong portfolio of profitable contracted U.S. wind projects for 2013 and 2014. Any incremental investment will be financed in a way that supports our strong credit position. And finally, at Lone Star Transmission, our focus will be on successfully transitioning from construction to operations. With that, we will now open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.
Dan Eggers - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Moray, can you just talk a little more about some of the '13 drivers to the point you guys are in a place to talk about them versus at the Analyst Day, just kind of some of the big pieces that will affect things? Obviously, normalization of wind asset performance is a pretty big driver year-on-year, the resource additions, but what else would we be thinking about?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Well, I think we laid out the kind of the details on the Energy Resources side in the third quarter call. So there's a stair step chart in there, and I'd have to try and recall all the specifics. But the -- I guess, the main differences in the dynamics between '12 and '13 are that we do not expect to have the same degree of either hedge roll-off or PTC roll-off, so we don't have that drag. We will see, relatively speaking, more of a contribution from the growth in new assets, obviously, with over 1,200 megawatts of wind going in, in the fourth quarter that didn't have much of an impact on 2012 results, but will -- they'll -- those assets will have a full year for 2013. Certainly, we anticipate, as we always do, a return to kind of normal weather and operating conditions, so those should be net positive relative to this year. And the rest of the pieces on the resources side, I think should be relatively small, there'll be a little bit of an increase from CITC. We've got 300 megawatts of solar that we'll expect to be electing CITC on, but that's not a huge amount. So that's the Energy Resources side. And then on the FPL side, really, it's a continuation of where we have been for the last couple of years. We continued to invest very heavily, albeit, not at the same rate as the $4 billion in 2012. But growth in capital employed, assuming that we can manage our cost structure effectively, which we're certainly committed to doing, should translate into strong growth in earnings.
Dan Eggers - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: And you're assuming you're going to earn the midpoint of your ROE at the utility?
Moray P. Dewhurst: We certainly hope we're going to be able to do better than that. But as I indicated in the prepared remarks, that's going to take a lot of work on our part. We are busily gemming up ideas, and I think we'll be in a position to share more of our ideas at the March conference, so I don't have any specific I can share with you. But we're very proud of our long-term cost track record, our O&M cents per kilowatt hour. But again, as I indicated in the prepared remarks, we have seen some upward pressures in nominal terms, so we are definitely going to be taking a fresh look at really all aspects that drive productivity and efficiency. Obviously, the structure of a 4-year agreement, one of the values of these agreements -- this agreement, as in past agreements, that it provides an appropriate set of incentives, so benefits that we can create can be of value to shareholders but also future value to customers. So we're going to be working very hard on that.
Dan Eggers - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. I have just one last one, just either for Armando or Jim If one of them could talk about how the process will work for identifying wind for '13/'14 to get built, and kind of where the customer interest is on moving projects forward. Now it looks like there's another year or 2 of life back in the PTC program.
James L. Robo: Another year to a life, I like that. Dan, the process is actually going to be very similar to what we've done in the past. We've -- the beginning of the year or certainly the beginning of the last couple of years, we go out and we meet with customers. It's -- we need to make sure that there is customer demand, and there's no better indication of that than customers that are willing to sign long-term power purchase agreements. So we're in the process of doing that. We have fielded several inbound calls, so it's not just the -- us or the other developers that -- they're clearly -- are excited about the passage of PTC legislation. We've got a number of customers that were waiting for something to happen, and now it's happened, and they are busily making calls. So I would say, over the next 2 to 3 months, it's a lot of customer visits. It's a lot of additional development on some projects that we put on hold last year. But I think as we said before, as an industry, we certainly expect 2013 to be a down year. This PTC extension, well received by us, but very late in the game. And therefore, a number of customers, our customers and other customers, bought wind last year in anticipation of potentially not having a PTC extension in '13 or '14. But also, there was a bunch of developers, obviously, that brought projects in earlier. So it's going to be a down year. But I think after the first quarter and certainly after the first 4 months of the year, we'll be in a much better position to understand what begin of construction means and what we might be able to do for 2013 and '14.
Moray P. Dewhurst: Dan, again, hopefully we can share more of our thoughts at the investor conference.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.
Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: On Slide 25, you lay out the performance of resources by business unit relative to the 2011 expectations. One, on the high-end of the performance was the new investment category at $200 million, could you just touch a little bit on what was the driver for the strong performance on new investments?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Stephen, I don't know that there was anything in particular. I think we were at the top end of where we expected to be. Things came in on time, on the early side. I guess I should turn the question over to Armando. He's probably more familiar with it.
Armando Pimentel: Stephen, a couple of things. One of them was we did have an acquisition last year that we weren't -- we certainly don't plan for acquisitions. We are always working on asset acquisitions. But we had a nice 160-, 165-megawatt acquisition, roughly $300 million or so. That was the Cimarron acquisition that we talked about. But in addition, there were some power purchase agreements that came to fruition, a -- very late in 2011, I actually think maybe 1 or 2 in January or February of 2012 that we did not expect when we first put the information together. So that's it really, it's the acquisition, a couple more wind projects, that got us that additional gross margin.
Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: And just looking at the performance for 2012, there were some income from gains on disposal of assets. Does that have any relevance going forward? Or can you provide a little more color on that?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Yes. Steve, I'm not sure which piece you're referring to, so let me give you the whole story. If you look at the GAAP income statement, you'll see a fairly substantial number. There's really 3 pieces in that number. There's a small amount, which is actually associated with disposal of a couple of small physical assets, that's the $0.03 that we discussed in the drivers. So that's pretty small. Virtually, all the rest is associated with gains on the Energy Resources decommissioning trusts. And that, in turn, is divided into 2 roughly equal parts. Roughly 1/2 of that, actually slightly more than 1/2 of it, close to $70 million pretax is simply associated with the reversal of OTTI losses that we previously excluded from adjusted income. So those are -- the gains there are also excluded from adjusted income. So the remainder, which is about $60 million pretax is just the gains associated with the normal management of the Energy Resources decommissioning trusts. So it's important to recognize that those trusts have grown significantly over the years. At the end of the year, they were worth about $1.3 billion. And obviously, 2012 was a good investment performance year. I think the actual return on the portfolio was something in the order of 12%. So as that -- as those investment returns move up or down, we will see some variability in the Energy Resources' income. I think, if I recall correctly, about -- a swing of about 4% in the realized return would correspond to about $0.01 of EPS.
Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay, I understood. So that does have an impact going forward just depending on the level of performance of that fund?
Moray P. Dewhurst: That's correct.
Operator: We'll go next to Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Just want to check a few things. One was -- it sounds to me like the wind outlook obviously has improved with the PTC extension, yet the 2014 forecast doesn't seem to have changed yet, although it sounds like there might be some upside there. Do I understand that correctly? Is there upside to the 2014 guidance because of wind but you guys haven't sort of baked it in yet because of the rules and the customer discussions, what have you?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Yes, that's fundamentally correct. We have -- the 2014 range that we shared today is the same as we've had out there. That just reflects our current backlog. So to the extent that we are able to add additional projects, which we certainly hope and expect we will now be able to do, that will be incremental to that. We're just not at a stage yet where we have a good sense of how much that may be.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: You figure the next few months you might?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Well, as I said, we hope to have more to share with you in the March investor conference, where -- whether we'll be at the stage, then where we can really translate it into specific EPS accretion, I'm not sure. As Armando said, it's going to depend a lot on customer interest. You've got to have a customer who has a need or desire for the renewable energy. And I'm just not sure how far along we'll be at that point.
James L. Robo: And Paul, just -- this is Jim. Just one other point on that. It depends a lot on the start of construction language that -- as it gets finalized. And the other thing I would say is even if we do put in a significant amount of new wind in 2014, that's primarily a 2015 earnings impact, not a 2014 earnings impact just because of timing and in service dates in the year. So I would expect that more to be a driver of post '14 earnings than of '14 earnings.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Okay, great. And then just to clarify on Dan's question with the ROE, the midpoint ROE that's in your guidance, is that sort of how we should think about the midpoint of the guidance as being the midpoint of the utility ROE sort of?
Moray P. Dewhurst: I think you need to make your own inferences there.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Okay. And then the 2014 -- last quarter, you guys saw yourselves as free cash flow positive. Is that still the case?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Well, again it comes back to the question of incremental investment. So really, nothing has changed to what I'll call our backlog only outlook that we've been discussing with you for quite some time. So to the extent that we are successful in generating new wind projects that have CapEx needs, obviously that's going to affect our cash flow requirements in 2014. But as I tried to indicate in the prepared remarks, we're going to finance those things in a way that supports our overall credit metrics. And anything that we do will necessarily be EPS accretive over the multiyear period.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Okay. And then just finally, CO2. Because there's some statements by the President at his Inauguration, there's been some speculation that there might be an EPA push for administratively as opposed to legislatively for a decrease in carbon. Have you guys heard about any specific -- have you heard anything about this? Can you -- I mean, I know you guys are sort of plugged-in there. Any sense as to whether or not there's -- there may be new efforts to reduce existing power plant CO2 emissions administratively from EPA?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Well, I'm not sure whether you call it new or not. But EPA has -- is required to issue rules affecting CO2 for both new units and existing units performance standards, as well as for other sources outside our industry. So I think we, along with everybody else in the industry, has been anticipating that those rules will be coming out at some point. What the timing is in each case is not always clear. So I don't know that there's anything new in that. I mean, obviously, you can draw any conclusions you like about whether they will be more aggressive or less aggressive in that, but I think we've all been expecting that to occur. But as we've always said, implementing carbon controls through rules is going to be a long and slow process and certainly would be inferior to a market-based approach, but that's what the law requires.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Greg Gordon with ISI Group.
William Appicelli : It's actually Bill Appicelli. Just -- I had a question about the underlying usage in customer growth. So for 2013 guidance, I mean, what is embedded in that in terms of weather-normal sales growth?
Moray P. Dewhurst: I think it's about 0.5%. We're not expecting a lot of growth in usage per customer. We were frankly pleasantly surprised by the strength of the growth this year. As we often said, quarter-to-quarter basis, it can be quite volatile, and it actually declined a little bit in the fourth quarter. So I think it's about 0.5% for the full year for next year.
William Appicelli : Okay. So then some of the commentary you had about some -- the construction activity improving, you guys are not really embedding any of that into your guidance sort of in the '13, '14 outlook as of right now. Is that -- I would...
Moray P. Dewhurst: Well, I think on the customer account -- customer count side, we're looking for essentially a little bit stronger continuation of this year, so sort of 0.7% or 0.8% growth in total customer count.
Operator: We'll go next to Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.
Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Also on the utility, just 2 questions, one on capital spending. I noticed that in the slide deck, you didn't include an update to CapEx projections. Just wanted a sanity check, do you -- when you think about CapEx at the utility going forward post the rate deal, outside of the big projects, the modernization projects, when you look at load growth and other factors in the state, do you see more kind of upside or downside to those CapEx levels, especially on kind of core distribution projects?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Well, I think relative to the numbers that are embedded in all the forward-looking statements that we've shared so far, we would certainly hope that there would be additional CapEx. As I tried to indicate in the prepared remarks, one of the things that we are, right now, looking very closely at is are there additional ways that we can deploy capital to improve the customer value equation. So we've been very successful in finding ways, essentially to substitute capital for fuel. That's really what those modernization projects are. But we think that there are some other opportunities within the business to substitute capital for other elements of the cost structure. I think that's how we're going to get some of our -- the productivity improvements that we'll be looking for. So again, we don't -- we're not far enough along where we have anything very specific to share with you. But that's really the -- what we're going through right now. So I think relative to the numbers that are already out there, if anything, I think we're going to have more. And then obviously, there are additional major project opportunities, the biggest single one obviously would be if we have any participation in the pipeline.
Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Got it. And on the O&M side, we've had a number of other companies in the sector talk about above inflationary growth rates in nuclear-related O&M. Some of the folks are starting to talk about pension cost impacting O&M labor contracts with the kind of inflationary or even greater than inflation. Can you talk about just high-level headwinds and tailwinds on O&M at the utility?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Well, let me take some of those in turn. On the nuclear side, we certainly have seen over the past years significant growth in the O&M on the nuclear side. I'm actually optimistic that in our particular case we're going to be heading into a period where those escalation rates start to come down. Obviously, with the completion of the uprates at the 4 Florida nuclear units, we've got a lot of good fresh equipment so that hopefully we'll have implications for ongoing cost. In the other operating units, I don't see at this stage any major adverse drivers. So I think really the challenge for us is can we find ways to improve real productivity to offset just the inflation rate trend. And I think the same is really true on the staff side. Unlike many companies, we don't have issue with the pension fund, so we are very well-funded. So I don't anticipate any major negative comparisons in future years on the pension side. So I think our situation is a little different. But having said that, we are already one of the most efficient performers in the industry. When we do our benchmarks, we see ourselves as a top decile cost position. So the challenge for us is to find real ways to improve the productivity of a very well performing business, and we're committed to try to do that.
Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Understood. Last item, on Slide 19, that bullet point about expecting to access a diverse array of financing instruments this year. Can you just give a little more detail or granularity on what that -- what you mean by that?
Moray P. Dewhurst: That's shorthand for we will continue with the same basic financing strategy that we've had for a long time, which includes starting with on the Energy Resources side where we have new projects with long-term contracts, against them, we will look first to the project finance and tax equity markets. We think that's a very powerful market test of the quality of our projects and it also produces a good economic result. We will finance the -- let me flip over to the FPL side. We've continued to maintain a balance capital structure consistent with where we've been, at roughly 59% equity ratio. So that will mean additional first mortgage bond issuances. And then the residual at the group capital -- or capital holdings, excuse me, level will be financed with a mixture of products that ensure that we maintain our target credit metrics, particularly for 2014. So this year, 2012, that meant a combination of what we call is hybrids, these deeply subordinated 60-year debentures, as well as the equity units. At this stage, we don't see any need for additional common equity this year. But that, again, would be subject to where we come out in our conclusions about incremental investment.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Hugh Wynne with Sanford Bernstein.
Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: My question was on the earnings waterfall at Energy Resources, Page 16. For the year as a whole, you show lower pricing as a $0.14 drag on Energy Resources' earnings, the PTC roll-off is a $0.09 drag. On the prior page, Page 15, where you look at the -- your quarter-over-quarter results, you don't mention either of those 2 items. What accounts for their absence in the fourth quarter? And what does their absence in the fourth quarter imply for the year ahead?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Well, the main reason for the absence is that -- the fourth quarter is a small quarter, and the bulk of the hedge value, in a sense, was concentrated in the middle of the year, so that's just the way the pattern works out for the year. But in terms of sort of implications for the future, as I indicated, the bulk of the negative impact of the hedge roll-offs was concentrated in 2012, so we don't expect that to be a major drag one way or the -- well, maybe a fact of one way or the other in 2013. I think some assets have a little uptick and some have a little down for 2013. And the PTC roll-off is largely a function of the -- as you can tell, of the pattern of projects that went into service 10 years ago. Those should not be a big negative drag in 2013.
Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Good. And then one other quick question, referring now to Page 19. How important a contribution to cash from operations in 2012 was bonus depreciation? And do you expect that to continue at a similar level next year?
Moray P. Dewhurst: That's a tough one. I don't have the answer to that one. I don't -- I haven't sorted out the impact on -- in 2012 of bonus depreciation. If you'll let me -- we'll get back to you on that.
Operator: And we'll go next to Jay Dobson with Wunderlich Securities.
James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division: Maybe if we could have Armando give an update on Spain solar and sort of what's happening there?
Moray P. Dewhurst: [indiscernible]
Armando Pimentel: Well, the Spain solar, the legislation, the proposed legislation that we've been talking about now for I think a couple of quarters was finally signed in early January. The results of that are about a $0.03 to $0.04 negative to the forecast that we had in our plans earlier in the 2012 timeframe. But the $0.03 to $0.04 obviously has been put in our forecast, and the numbers that Moray has given you for 2013 and 2014 incorporate that in it. Right now, we don't see any other attempts to change what was just approved in Spain, to either change the ad valorem tax or to change the way that natural gas prices -- or natural gas can be used in the generation. We're still working through some small issues related to our financing. But we're -- honestly, we're very close to getting those projects COD-ed. Unit 1 is running through all its tests right now. We expect Unit 1 to be COD in March. And Unit 2 is actually pretty close behind Unit 1. So I'm pushing the team pretty aggressively to get Unit 2 in earlier in the second quarter rather than later. So from a construction -- from an operational standpoint, obviously, we've run a lot of test. The plant is working very nicely. From a legislative regulatory point of view, we wished it would've worked out a bit better than what it did, and we're not done trying to figure out whether we can better what was signed into law. But the $0.03 to $0.04 bad guy is in our forecast, and I'm actually looking forward to be getting over there and having a nice ribbon-cutting and thanking all of the employees that have spent the better part of 3 years bringing that project to fruition.
James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division: That's great. That's a super update, Armando. Moray, maybe just turning then to pension impacts for 2013, I think in the prior question, you addressed the utility side of it. Just across the entire organization on a consolidated basis, your outlook for pension cost impact in 2013?
Moray P. Dewhurst: It's the same. It's a single pension fund, and it's well-funded. So historically, we've actually had a slight credit to income through pension accounting, and we expect that to continue, but it's not material. We don't expect any changes.
James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division: Perfect. And then last one for Jim if I can, and I'm sure you'll have more on this at the March Analyst Meeting. But if I recall, you've historically talked about sort of a 5% to 7% growth rate. And as I look out and you're in the unusual position of having 2 years of guidance out here, so thanks for that, but if I look at the midpoint of 2013 and move that the 2014, I've got a rather wide range of 4% to 16% growth. Although I'm not asking for you to comment on or help me find the place in 2014, I would love if you could comment on that longer-term growth rate and sort of how that's fitting in amongst the various possibilities that you're sort of looking at for 2014 and beyond.
James L. Robo: Jay, I think what we've said and we said it last quarter and I think Moray said it in the prepared remarks this quarter is that the drivers of our growth that we've seen through 2014 continue post-2014 as well, and we will have more to say about our future growth prospects in that March investor conference. Frankly, that's a big reason why we are going to have the half-day session is to lay out some thoughts on our future growth drivers.
Operator: And that does conclude the question-and-answer session, as well as today's conference call. We thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the NextEra Energy 2012 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Julie Holmes, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Julie Holmes: Thank you, Roxane [ph]. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter 2012 earnings conference call. Joining us this morning are Jim Robo, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; Moray Dewhurst, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; Armando Pimentel, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources; and Eric Silagy, President of Florida Power & Light Company. Moray will provide an overview of our results. Following which, our executive team will be available to answer your questions. We will be making statements during this call that are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release, in the comments made during this conference call, in the Risk Factors section of the accompanying presentation or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website, nexteraenergy.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. Please also note that today's presentation includes references to adjusted earnings and adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying this presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of the non-GAAP measure to the closest GAAP financial measure. With that, I will turn the call over to Moray.
Moray P. Dewhurst: Thank you, Julie. Good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy delivered solid third quarter results despite challenging market conditions in Energy Resources' major markets, and we remain well-positioned to achieve our overall objectives both for this year and for the longer term. We have previously indicated that our focus this year is on executing against plans that are expected to drive growth for the company across both its principal businesses through the middle of the decade, and I'm pleased to be able to report that all our major initiatives continue on track. At Florida Power & Light, we continue to deliver superior value to our customers, which is the foundation of our strategy and is demonstrated by providing the lowest typical residential bills in the state combined with superior reliability, award-winning customer service and a clean emission profile. We continue to invest capital at a record rate in major projects that will improve this value proposition over time, including our nuclear uprates and fossil modernization initiatives, all of which made good progress this quarter. The rapid growth in our regulatory capital employed, combined with a consistent earned ROE enabled by the current rate settlement agreement, naturally resulted in strong earnings growth at FPL. We completed the technical hearing for FPL's base rate case and entered into a proposed settlement agreement with 3 major interveners. Although this proposed agreement is opposed by the Office of Public Counsel, the Florida Public Service Commission has scheduled evidentiary hearings in November and will fully consider it at that time with a decision likely by the end of the year. At Energy Resources, our financial performance was hampered by the continuing impact of the down power at Seabrook and by disappointingly mild market conditions in Texas, but in other respects, remained solid. I will provide more detail later in the call. We continue to make good progress on our record backlog of renewables projects, all of which remain on track. We expect to bring into service more than 1,200 megawatts of new U.S. wind capacity in the fourth quarter. Included in this amount is the expected acquisition of 165-megawatt project that is additive to the numbers we have discussed in prior earnings releases. In addition, we disclosed during the quarter that we signed our first PPA for a 2013 U.S. wind project, a project that is not dependent upon extension of the PTC program, which, as you know, is scheduled -- currently scheduled to lapse at the end of this year. While this additional PPA by itself is not large enough to change the range of our financial expectations, we see it as supportive of the view we have publicly expressed that there will continue to be a Wind Development business in the U.S. post-2012 even if the PTC program is not extended. Because of the continued progress we have made against our execution objectives, there have been no significant changes to our expectations either for this year or for the longer term. We continue to believe that the major investments we are making at both of our primary businesses will drive our growth in 2013 and beyond and allow us to attain our longer-range expectations. Our expectations include a satisfactory degree of rate relief at FPL, either through approval of the proposed settlement agreement or through a fair and balanced order on the underlying base rate case. As a reminder, we expect adjusted earnings per share for 2012 to be in the range of $4.35 to of $4.65. And for 2014, we continue to see a range of $5.05 to $5.65, subject to all the usual caveats we provide, including normal weather and operating conditions. Let's now walk through our results for the quarter. We will begin with the results at FPL and then discuss Energy Resources and the consolidated numbers. For the third quarter of 2012, FPL reported net income of $392 million or $0.93 per share, up $0.10 per share year-over-year. As in the first half of the year, FPL's results this quarter were driven by continued investment in the business to improve overall customer value. During the quarter, we invested roughly $900 million of the approximately $4.3 billion we expect to invest in FPL in 2012. And regulatory capital employed, that is capital on which we are able to earn a return, grew 18% over the same quarter last year. This capital investment program is central to our strategy of delivering the best customer value proposition in the state. Although the increase in capital requires a degree of base rate relief, the life cycle benefits for customers are very significant. Even with slight upward pressure on rates in the short term, we expect our typical residential bills to continue to be the lowest in the state. And the value delivery to customers improves with each passing year owing to the use of straight line depreciation for rate-making purposes. During the quarter, we amortized approximately $33 million of surplus depreciation, enabling us to maintain a regulatory ROE of 11%, consistent with the 2010 rate settlement agreement. For the full year, we continue to expect to recognize roughly $500 million of surplus depreciation, amortization. Utilization of approximately $190 million of the remaining surplus in 2013 is built into our rate case filing. As we said on a number of occasions, FPL is in the midst of the largest capital deployment phase in its history. During the quarter, we continued construction of both our Cape Canaveral and Riviera Beach modernization projects. Cape Canaveral is now 86% complete and is currently on schedule and on budget, with an expected in-service date in mid-2013. The Riviera Beach modernization is also moving ahead with 22% of construction complete and it, too, is running on time and on budget. Our third modernization project, Port Everglades, is well into its development cycle, and we continue to expect to bring that plant into service in mid-2016. Execution on our nuclear uprate program at FPL is also well along, with final completion anticipated for the spring of next year. 2 of the 4 Florida units have completed their uprate work and are now operational. During the quarter, St. Lucie Unit 2 received its required license amendment from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to operate at higher power levels and is expected to return to service by the end of the year. And the fourth unit, Turkey Point Unit 4, will begin its uprate in the fourth quarter with completion expected in the spring of 2013. While the final capital investment will be greater than originally estimated, the incremental output will also be greater. The uprates are now expected to provide at least an additional 526 megawatts of clean, emissions-free energy for our customers, roughly the equivalent of a medium-sized nuclear plant. Combined with the improvement in the material condition of the plants, this extra capacity will serve our customers well for many years to come. The gas plant modernizations and nuclear uprates are expected to provide significant benefits to our customers over the lives of the plants and also to provide the platform for earnings growth in the business. When discussing these projects in an earnings release or in the hearing room, it is easy to take for granted the enormous effort required to execute them successfully. So I'd like to take a moment to recognize the hard work, dedication and coordination of thousands of employees and contractors and to thank them for their commitment to excellence in meeting the many project milestones thus far. We look forward to the final completion of all these projects and to delivering improved value to our customers through lower fuel costs, enhanced reliability and cleaner air. Before moving on to discuss the Florida economy, I'd like to note 2 other developments both indicative of our commitment to customer service. First, while Florida has been very fortunate so far this hurricane season, we must always be prepared. In August, our service territory was affected by tropical storm, Isaac, which resulted in heavy rains, severe flooding and localized wind damage. Altogether, more than 400,000 customers experienced outages. But thanks to good preparation and the hard work of employees, contractors and our mutual aid partners, FPL was able to restore power to nearly 60% of affected customers within 4 hours and more than 95% within 24 hours. Second, and just this month, J.D. Power and Associates released results of the first wave of their Residential Customer Satisfaction survey for 2013. FPL retained its top ranking in Florida, its second-place rank among large segment utilities in the South region and improved its national ranking to 17 from 25 among all 126 U.S. utilities. This is a testament to the hard work and customer focus of FPL's 10,000 employees. In Florida, most economic indicators we follow continue to improve modestly. Tourism taxable sales have grown steadily over the past 2 years and are now well above sales levels seen prior to the recession. Consumer confidence is trending in a positive direction, and the September figure is the highest reported since 2007. Although Florida has experienced positive year-over-year job growth for more than 2 years, there were signs earlier this year that job growth was slowing. Recent data have been a bit more encouraging, with job growth stabilizing in recent months. Employment gains have been particularly strong in business and professional services, health care, retail trade and leisure and hospitality. Job losses in the construction and government sectors continued to limit the overall pace of job creation in Florida. The unemployment rate mirrors national trends, with rates remaining stubbornly high by historical standards. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in Florida was down slightly in September to 8.7%, which is 1.7% lower than September 2011. There was also a significant increase in the state's labor force during this period. Florida's relative position has also improved. It now ranks 37th in the U.S. in terms of the unemployment rate, with states such as Georgia, South Carolina and Connecticut having higher unemployment rates. All in all, while we are not where we would like to be, the Florida outlook is clearly improving. Turning now to the Florida housing market. Here, too, we continue to see signs of improvement. As shown on the accompanying slide, although there was a slight uptick in the delinquency rate in the second quarter, the inventory of existing homes continues to decline which in turn is helping to spur new construction growth and drive increases in home prices. In August, the number of housing permits in Florida reached its highest level in more than 4 years, although it is still well below the prerecession peak. According to the Case-Shiller Index, Florida home prices continue to increase year-over-year, with the most recent data showing the largest annual increase since 2006. On the whole, housing indicators are trending in a positive direction and we are encouraged by the data. Most of our customer metrics at FPL also continued to improve gradually. During the third quarter, we had approximately 30,000 more customers than in the comparable quarter of 2011, representing an increase of 0.7%. We have now seen fairly consistent growth for the last 10 quarters, and we remain encouraged by this trend. Underlying usage also increased for the fourth consecutive quarter, up 1.6% over the same quarter last year. On the other hand, the improvement in inactive and low-usage accounts seems to have stalled. In September, the number of inactive meters decreased, but the percentage of low-usage customers remained roughly flat compared to the same period last year. As you will recall, we filed a request for a base rate increase in the first quarter this year. In mid-August, just prior to commencing the technical hearing in the case, we reached agreement on all key issues with 3 of the major interveners representing customer groups, including Florida Industrial Power Users Group, South Florida Hospital & Healthcare Association and Federal Executive Agencies. A fourth intervener, Algenol Biofuels, has indicated support for the proposed settlement agreement as well. However, the Office of Public Counsel, which by statute is supposed to represent all Florida customers, has opposed the settlement. Major terms of the settlement include a 4-year term; a $378 million retail base revenue increase effective January 2013; an allowed regulatory return on equity of 10.7% with 100 basis point band; Generation Base Rate Adjustments, or GBRA, upon commercial operations of our Cape Canaveral, Riviera Beach and Port Everglades modernizations, based on the capital costs for Cape Canaveral as filed in the rate case and the capital cost for Riviera Beach and Port Everglades that were approved during their respective need hearings; and finally, flexibility over the 4-year term to amortize up to $400 million of the remaining surplus depreciation credit plus a portion of the fossil dismantlement reserve. We believe the settlement as a whole is fair to both shareholders and customers. While we continue to believe our initial base rate request is warranted, parties must compromise in order to reach a settlement. In this case, we have given up a portion of allowed return on equity in exchange for longer-term certainty around the investments in our modernization projects and infrastructure that in turn are expected to enable FPL to continue providing low bills and superior performance. The settlement offers investors the prospect of a reasonable return and a reasonable degree of risk while, at the same time, providing customers greater certainty around long-term bill affordability. Since base rates comprise roughly half of the typical residential bill, the settlement offers customers confidence that their bills will remain among the lowest in the state for at least the term of the agreement. In August, the Florida Public Service Commission held a technical hearing on the initial base rate request. We are very comfortable with the totality of the evidence submitted to the commission during these 2 weeks and continue to believe that we have the prospect of a fair and balanced outcome should the commission choose to approve the proposed settlement agreement or instead rule on the merits of the underlying base rate request. However, the commission has laid out a schedule to hear additional evidence specifically related to the proposed settlement agreement, and we are now preparing for a hearing on that evidence, which is scheduled to take place November 19 through November 21. A special agenda conference has been scheduled for December 13 to consider the settlement agreement. As we have noted previously, we continue to expect to have the lowest typical residential bill in the state whether the commission rules in favor of the settlement agreement or issues a determination on the fully litigated case. Under the proposed settlement, the increase in FPL's typical residential customer bills in 2013 would be roughly $1.50 a month or $0.05 a day. We strongly believe this settlement, which would help secure low rates for our customers through the end of 2016 while supporting our continued ability to provide safe, highly reliable low-cost service, is very much in the public interest. Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported third quarter 2012 GAAP earnings of $44 million or $0.10 per share. Adjusted earnings for the third quarter were $162 million or $0.38 per share. Adjusted earnings exclude the effect of the mark on non-qualifying hedges and net other than temporary impairments on certain investments, or OTTI, and for 2011, the after-tax loss on natural gas-fired generating assets held for sale. Energy Resources' contribution to adjusted earnings in the third quarter was below last year's by $0.11, but only a few cents below where we had hoped to be primarily due to lower-than-normal wind resource. On this chart, we have shared the drivers of the changes from last year's third quarter in the standard format we commonly use. However, because several of the elements on this chart are interrelated and there are more than the usual number of puts and takes, let me try and put the overall results in perspective. Last year's third quarter benefited from 2 factors that are not present this quarter. First, we had operating contributions from the gas-fired assets that were sold late last year, and obviously, these are not present this year. Net of the associated savings and interest, this amounts to about $0.05. Overall, the sale is EPS accretive, but given the pattern of earnings, there is a negative comparison in the third quarter. Second, last year's third quarter included gains on the close-out of some hedges in the gas infrastructure area, which amounted to about $0.08. Since they are an ongoing part of the business, these hedge close-outs should not be thought of as onetime gains or they will tend to be lumpy. If we factor out these 2 effects, this year's third quarter would have been up by about $0.02. This difference in turn is a function of some ups and downs. You may recall that last year's third quarter was challenged by extreme conditions in Texas. This year, we were much better protected against extreme conditions, but the summer turned out to be very mild and flat from a pricing standpoint. Last year, our customer supply and trading activities struggled in a difficult environment. This year, they bounced back, albeit to levels still below those of 2009 and 2010. The net of all these was roughly a positive $0.09. We also benefited from growth in the business with new assets contributing about $0.05 net of their associated interest. On the other hand, we gave up about $0.04 because of the down power at Seabrook and the refueling outage that began in September, and the existing wind portfolio was down $0.02 due to PTC roll-offs. As I mentioned earlier, the wind resource was below normal but it was comparable to last year's third quarter. All other effects, which include slight declines in other operating assets, slight increases in O&M and G&A and share dilution amount to a negative $0.06. Many of these effects we could reasonably anticipate or are typical of the variability in the business. Relative to our expectations at this time last year, the major differences were primarily below-average wind resource, as well as the Seabrook down power and disappointingly mild conditions in Texas. Nevertheless, we are satisfied with the financial performance and continue to feel comfortable with the outlook for the full year. At Energy Resources, we continue to focus on executing on our largest ever backlog of renewables projects. In the third quarter, we brought an additional 80 megawatts of U.S. wind online, and year-to-date, we have added approximately 250 megawatts of wind to our portfolio. We expect to bring more than 1,200 megawatts of U.S. wind projects into service in the fourth quarter this year and are therefore on track to add approximately 1,500 megawatts of U.S. wind in 2012, including the 165-megawatt project mentioned earlier in this call. This will be the biggest wind program ever completed in this country in a single year, and we'll push our total wind portfolio over the 10,000-megawatt mark. Looking at growth beyond 2012, the roughly 600 megawatts of Canadian wind projects in our backlog are on schedule to meet their expected timeline for completion through 2015, with the majority expected to come online in 2013 and 2014. Also, as we mentioned earlier in the call, we added a new U.S. wind project to our backlog in 2013 that is not dependent on any extension of production tax credits. We are moving ahead with our plans to add roughly 900 megawatts of solar generation through 2016. In July, our McCoy solar project received approval from the California Public Utility Commission for its 250-megawatt 20-year PPA with Southern California Edison. Overall, we are pleased with the progress we have made in meeting our execution objectives. Looking at the company on a consolidated basis. For the third quarter of 2012, NextEra Energy's GAAP net income was $415 million or $0.98 per share. NextEra Energy's 2012 third quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $532 million and $1.26, respectively. Year-to-date through the third quarter, the company's adjusted earnings were approximately $1.5 billion or $3.55 per share compared to approximately $1.4 billion or $3.44 per share for the same period last year. On an adjusted basis, the corporate and other segment was down $0.04 from the same quarter last year, primarily due to a $0.03 impairment charge on an early stage technology investment. Earlier this month, the Public Utility Commission of Texas voted on aspects of our Lone Star Transmission project. While the results were disappointing, the impact to the overall project is not material to our corporate outlook. We remain on track with our construction program and expect to bring the line into full service in the spring of 2013. In the third quarter, we issued a second round of equity units, bringing the total to $1.25 billion for the year. This completes our near-term equity needs based on the projects currently in our backlog and ensures we have the balance sheet strength we need for the immediate future. We continue to expect to be free cash flow positive in 2014. As we stated earlier this year, we are targeting a 55% dividend payout ratio in 2014 as a consequence of the mix of our portfolio continuing to shift towards more regulated and long-term contracted assets. This translates into a compound annual growth rate for dividends of approximately 10% using a 2011 base. In light of the results achieved year-to-date and the progress made against our execution objectives, we continue to be comfortable with the 2012 and 2014 adjusted EPS expectations that we shared with you last fall. As we indicated earlier in the call, we expect adjusted EPS in 2012 to be in the range of $4.35 to $4.65. And for 2014, we continue to see a range of $5.05 to $5.65. As always, our expectations are subject to the usual caveats we provide, including normal weather and operating conditions. We recognize that our third quarter results are below where many analysts had projected we would be this quarter. As you may recall, we have often indicated that we do not provide quarterly financial expectations since we believe the timing of earnings may shift throughout the year and our focus should be on achieving our annual objectives. At this point in the year, we are comfortable with our current performance. To provide some perspective, it may be worth noting that year-to-date through the third quarter, NextEra Energy has posted adjusted earnings of $3.55 per share. Achieving the midpoint of our full year earnings expectations implies fourth quarter adjusted earnings growth of just 2.2% above the prior year. We believe this is reasonably achievable and certainly hope to do better. At this point in the year, we would normally seek to provide you our thoughts on earnings expectations for the year ahead. However, given the schedule of events for FPL's base rate proceeding, we are not yet in a position to do so. We had also indicated that we hoped to be in a position to hold an investor conference late in the year, but we think it makes sense to defer this until we have greater clarity around FPL's outlook for next year. While visibility around FPL's potential financial performance in 2013 will remain limited until a rate case decision is issued, we have provided FPL's expected regulatory capital employed for 2013 in the appendix to this presentation. For the full year, we expect average regulatory capital employed to be in the range of $27 million to $28 million. Separately, we can offer a few thoughts about Energy Resources. The most important observation is that after 2 very challenging years driven by adverse market conditions, we expect Energy Resources to return to growth in 2013. We have previously discussed the headwinds associated with declining power prices and hedge roll-offs. While there is some continuing effect in 2013, the biggest impact is in 2012. With the large 2012 U.S. wind program beginning to have an impact in 2013, we believe the business is well-positioned to pick up again. In 2013, we expect adjusted earnings at Energy Resources to grow approximately 10% to 15% above 2012 to a range of $740 million to $780 million subject to all the usual caveats we provide including normal weather and operating conditions. As we do each year in the third quarter, we have updated our equivalent gross margin hedge slides and included an additional year forward. The portfolio financial information for 2013 and 2014 can be found in the appendix to the presentation. For 2013, all projects which are expected to be in service by the end of 2012 have been moved to their respective categories which, in this case, is predominantly contracted wind. For the 2014, projects expected to come into service in both 2013 and 2014 are included in the new investments line. In aggregate, our existing asset portfolio is roughly 95% hedged against primary commodity price movements in 2013 and 93% hedged in 2014. On a comparable basis, the equivalent figures for 2015 and 2016 are 88% and 84%, respectively. We are also providing some additional portfolio information on our Investor Relations website in the Quarterly Business Updates section. For Energy Resources wind assets, we have identified each project's tax credit election, either PTC or ITC. And for all Energy Resources' assets, we have included the financing structure, either project debt or differential membership interest, otherwise known as tax equity. And we hope you find the additional information helpful. To close, let me bring you back to our summary list of critical success factors for 2012. This list hasn't changed, and we continue to be very focused on excellence in execution. We are pleased with our progress so far in 2012 but recognize that we have more that we need to accomplish before the end of the year. And with that, we will now be happy to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.
Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: As you look at the evolution of the Texas market, there now are essentially 2 different regulatory models that the router [ph] group recently proposed. As you think about those different constructs, could you talk at high level in terms of the impacts to your business over time?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Sure, let me ask Armando to pick that one up.
Armando Pimentel: Stephen, we're going to know a lot more, obviously, after tomorrow's meeting in Texas, which is an important meeting. I think it's a bit early for us to talk about what the ultimate and potential impacts are of either one. As a general rule, any mechanism that provides both current and future generators with some mechanism to be able to keep their plants open, to be economic and to potentially build future plants is a positive not only for the folks in Texas and the Texas market but also for the generators. So I don't want to speculate on what either plan might do for us. We have filed comments though with the PUCT. We certainly do prefer and support the capacity market out in ERCOT. We think that's the best way to be able to not only support current generators but future generators. And I don't know whether you've seen on our comments or not, but we also believe that the reserve requirement should be a requirement, the reserve margin, as opposed to something that they just shoot for.
Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Understood. And then just as follow-up, as you look at renewables growth opportunities, we've seen some activity there. Do you see the PTC question of expiration or extension driving that very much? Or could you just talk more broadly about as you see opportunities on the M&A side to acquire assets, what's your general take on the ability to grow via M&A?
Armando Pimentel: I think there's -- I've made comments before where I've been pretty optimistic about projects that we might be able to pick up on the M&A front, and those have -- the reality has not proved to be true. But we, even if that's the case, we have picked up at least one asset or so every year for the last couple of years, and we've done that again in the third quarter, an asset that we hope to close in the fourth quarter. I will tell you that there is a lot of activity out there. There's a lot of projects that -- single projects that we're looking at and multiple projects that we're looking at both on the existing projects, those in construction and those in development. A lot of that I think will depend on what happens with the PTC extension at the end of the year and what equity holders believe they've got to sell. I would be disappointed if at some point during the next 12 to 15 months, we don't pick up at least 1 or 2 other significant projects like we just picked up in the third quarter of this year. On the PTC front and what that means for new development for us, obviously, there's going to be a big difference in 2013 compared to 2012. If there is no PTC in 2013, but even if there is a PTC in 2013, there's obviously a significant amount of activity in 2012 that's taking place. So even with the PTC, I think the overall activity will be down. We're still fairly optimistic that there will be an extension for 1, at least for 1 year and maybe for a couple of years. We're just going to have to wait and see what happens from now through the end of the year. But even without a PTC, we think there will be some opportunities in certain states to develop wind in 2013. And as we showed during the quarter, when we signed a 100-megawatt PPA, there may be a few more of those out there.
Moray P. Dewhurst: Just to add one comment on that. I do think that there's a little bit of an interaction between the state of the asset acquisition market and the prospects for PTC extension. So everybody obviously is waiting to see what happens with the PTC extension, and that clearly is going to affect different folks thinking about assets that they may hold. So I think if we get a PTC then you may see -- well, you will obviously see us with more greenfield development, you may see others, too. If you don't see a PTC extension, then I think there will be relatively more activity on the asset M&A front.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Daniel Eggers with Crédit Suisse.
Dan Eggers - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: On the utility side, I guess just kind of given how wide the parties are between agreeing to the settlement and not agreeing to the settlement, should we assume that this is going to have to go through the full hearing process to make a decision on the settlement? Or do you guys have any sense of maybe a deal can get done without having to go through the full process?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Well, as we said in the prepared remarks, we are right now actively getting ourselves ready for live testimony, cross-examination on November 19 through 21. So we are certainly expecting that we will be there, and we will have a thorough hearing on the additional aspects that are in the settlement agreement that were not covered in the technical hearing in August for the underlying case. As we also indicated, there's an agenda conference currently scheduled for December 13. So we would certainly expect to have a resolution on that before the end of the year.
Dan Eggers - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And then on usage trends of the utility, it looked like there's some nicely positive underlying demand trends kind of popping up better than we've seen recently. Is there any more color you can kind of share on where that extra usage is coming from as you guys look at what the customers are doing?
Moray P. Dewhurst: There's not a lot of additional detail I can give you. I guess we've had some good news on the usage front for the last several quarters. We're a little bit reluctant to declare that a trend, just in case it might go away on us. But it's certainly encouraging, but not a lot of detail on where it's coming from. So it's more than you would expect from ongoing underlying usage growth. So I think there's sort of some recovery factor in there. But as I said, we are back to the old phrase, cautiously optimistic that we'll see some underlying usage growth continue. But probably not at the levels that we've seen the last couple of quarters.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Steve Fleishman with Bank of America.
Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Just, Moray, a couple of questions on the forward hedging slides. It looks like the gas infrastructure line moved up meaningfully in '13, '14. Could you give us a little more color on what's going on in that business?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Well, fundamentally, growth in the business, as we continue with seeing additional opportunities and reflecting that in our expectations. So what we are learning from our existing production activities is encouraging. So just greater volumes overall is what's driving that.
Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And is there any reason why you used a September 7 date for these, since that was pretty much probably the bottom in the power market?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Sheer bad luck, that happened to be the date of the roll-up that we based this set of views on. But you are right that it was an interesting inflection point, so we've seen a pretty strong increase in pricing since then. But that was just coincidence.
James L. Robo: This is Jim. Just 1 comment. Remember, we're pretty well-hedged in '13 and '14, so those -- that volatility is really more relevant for our out-year earnings than it is for the near term.
Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And then one last question, just more to confirm your comments for this year that basically to get to the midpoint of your guidance this year, you just need 2.2% up fourth quarter.
Moray P. Dewhurst: That's correct.
Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And that doesn't seem to be a stretch to achieve?
Moray P. Dewhurst: No. I mean, if you think about the sort of drivers for Energy Resources, we're going to see some growth from new assets, and the gas producing activity should grow a little bit. The existing portfolio should be very roughly flat. I'm sure there'll be some puts and takes as usual. We've got a refueling outage coming up at Duane Arnold, but that's offset by the fact that we should have a shorter outage at Point Beach because last year, we had the big outage for the uprate. So fundamentally, we should see some continued good growth from the new assets, and so we feel pretty good about where that is subject to all the usual caveats. There's a lot of time to go, and there's always ups and downs in that business. Also, the fourth quarter, there's typically less uncertainty around the variability of just market conditions. Obviously, the third quarter is your big quarter. It was, as I said in the prepared remarks, a little disappointing in Texas. But you usually have greater visibility on the fourth quarter. And then on the other side of the house, it's the same story, maintaining a consistent ROE but continuing to invest the capital in the major projects. And we should see a continued trend of earnings growth there. So we feel pretty good about that. And again as I indicated, we certainly hope we'll do better than the midpoint of the range. But I just provided the 2.2% to give some perspective on it. It doesn't seem that unreasonable.
Operator: We'll go next to Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: I just wanted to follow-up on Steve's question on the gas business. I wasn't clear, I'm sorry if I'm just a little slow there. It does seem like a big jump in that infrastructure business, and you said it was because of volumes, is that right? Could you just help me out a little bit more, drill a little bit deeper for me?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Yes. Let me ask you, which numbers are you referring to specifically, so I'm [indiscernible]?
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: If we look at the EBITDA numbers for -- in the portfolio financial information, those hedge numbers, if you look at 2013 and 2014, the numbers look like they've substantially increased for EBITDA in the range for the gas infrastructure business, and...
Moray P. Dewhurst: Okay, that's fine. You're looking at the comparison 2013 to 2014.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Right, and 2013, you're right, just from last quarter to this quarter.
Moray P. Dewhurst: Right, yes. Recognize that, that's a fairly -- if you think of the difference between gross margin and EBITDA, that's a fairly leveraged business. So there's a certain level of sort of a "fixed cost" but -- organizational infrastructure cost that you need to drive that business, but that doesn't scale lineally with the scale of production. So as your production ramps up, you should get some profitability leverage. And I think that's what you're seeing there. So you've got a volume growth being leveraged by cost structure because the operating expenses are not growing as rapidly as the underlying gross margin.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: And that volume growth is being -- I mean, the outlook for that volume growth has increased because of anything in particular? Or just, I mean, how do we think about that? And I guess is it -- can I go back down or I mean...
Moray P. Dewhurst: I think you should think about this as simply growth in the business, more activities, more wells producing. Recognize that these shale gas wells, so they have a typical decline curve, the shale gas production does. So a lot of your activity is really driven by your drilling activity ultimately. So it's a business that you can modulate. And as we've seen good opportunities, we just scaled up the level of activity.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Okay, great. And then just on the production tax credit, sort of the mechanics of that maybe getting extended. There's some talk about the fiscal cliff and how they might just sort of keep -- sort of agree to sort of kick it down the road to be addressed with more of a major tax reform kind of a situation to be developed a few months down the road, if you follow me. And I'm just wondering if that would probably keep the production tax credit where it is, or whether or not it would -- and if that were to happen, if they were to say simply like, "we'll keep things sort of status quo for the next 6 months as we try to iron something out", would that mean the production tax credit would be in effect? And if it were, how would that impact you guys or how would you -- or would it be enough time to help you get more projects in. Do you follow what I'm sort of saying?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Yes. One comment first. Let me ask Jim to comment also. I mean obviously, any response to that question has to be speculation, because how they might resolve, "kicking the can down the road" scenario remains to be seen. But with that caveat, Jim you want to...
James L. Robo: Yes. I think 2 things, Paul. One is that when you look at the history of how the PTC has been extended as it's expired, historically, what happened is that it's been brought up as part of a package. There's something like 61 or 62, I'm probably getting that number wrong, but it's correct in order of magnitude, expiring tax credits at the end of this year. The PTC is obviously one of those. And historically, what's happened is that the lawmakers have simply scratched out the 2012 and written in 2013 in the bill and kicked the can down the road. I think that there's certainly some odds that, that will happen. I think the important thing to remember about 2013 though, and Armando already said it, is regardless of whether there is a PTC extension or not, 2013 is not going to be a very big wind installation year in the country. Folks are not going long equipment in order to bet on whether the PTC will get extended. Suppliers are not building inventory. And so there is a -- even if the PTC is extended in December, it will be very hard for folks to get projects in place in 2013. So it's going to be not a large year whether the PTC is extended or not.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.
Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Real quick, just on the utility side, I mean obviously, whatever rate increase comes out of the rate case would be a tailwind for the business. But how do you think about cost pressures next year and beyond at FP&L?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Well, I guess, the short-term outlook is not really inconsistent with what we've seen over the last few years, i.e. continued modest pressure on O&M but nothing out of the ordinary. I guess in the spirit of full disclosure, I should point out that under the settlement agreement with a fixed term, our exposure, our income exposure to unexpected increases in inflation or interest rates obviously is higher. So that's an aspect of the overall agreement. So right now, we don't see anything on the horizon that's causing us great concern. Just continued slow pressure on nominal O&M offset by our normal, continued incremental productivity from year-to-year.
Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I guess, when you think about O&M at the utility, do you think about -- I mean, is your goal -- is your normal trend kind of inflationary plus whatever the cost of any new assets that you bring online in a given year, has it been higher than inflationary? And if so, what are the drivers? Kind of what do you think the biggest puts and takes could be?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Well, for the last few years, the net O&M growth has been slightly positive in real terms, but that's really been driven by a couple of major things, benefits and insurance costs. If you factor those out, everything else has been going down maybe a percentage point a year in real terms. So we've -- over the last decade, we've gone from a period where we were still able to drive costs out in nominal terms to a period where we were driving them out in real terms but were kind of flat-to-rising nominal. For the last few years, it's been slightly up in real terms, but as I say, primarily due to the benefits and insurance. Insurance is obviously kind of a cyclical phenomena. I don't see that continuing at the same pace for future years.
Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay, and last item. Just pension and OPEB, as you're kind of getting closer to the year end of 2012, how do you think about that in terms of cost pressures for beyond 2012?
Moray P. Dewhurst: There is an impact in 2013 from the pension. You've got the effect of losses sustained during the down period a few years back that rolled through. It's not huge. The OPEB is a minor factor.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Greg Gordon with ISI Group.
Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: So the vast majority of my questions have been answered. I just wanted to ask you to dig down a little bit more into Texas in the quarter. There were a lot of puts and takes at Energy Resources, one of them was $0.09 favorable from less extreme weather, better supply and trading in Texas. But you also indicated that, that wasn't as much of a rebound as you had otherwise hoped for given that the weather kind of flip-flopped the other way and was maybe more mild than people had hoped. Can you dive a little bit more in the components of that $0.09 and then sort of going into next year and beyond, sort of are you more or less at a stable platform? Or are there other adjustments we should expect to get back to sort of what you think a stable margin is in Texas?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Yes. Let me make a couple of general comments, and then ask Armando also to add his thoughts. A couple of different things going on. Recall that last year's third quarter really was some pretty extreme conditions in Texas. And as we indicated back then, the good performance that we had on our gas-fired assets was more than accounted for by weakness in the Retail business and the fact that wind happened not to blow during the worst of the spiking prices. So all of that, in a sense, reversed itself. And we got back to kind of a normal situation from that perspective. But relative to a typical summer year, we just didn't see the number of days of strong prices. I'm not talking about the 1000-plus megawatt hour periods but just regular strong days. So for example, there were -- in the entire quarter, I believe there were only 3 days where the average price in ERCOT was above $100 a megawatt hour, even in what we call the needle peak of 2:00 to 6:00 hours. So it was just a very flat pricing environment. And so that is below what we would normally expect of a typical summer. In a typical summer, you're going to get more short-term periods of volatility than that. So it's sort of -- it came back from the extreme but it didn't come back to what you would typically think off as a normal level. So with that -- those general comments, let me see if Armando wants to add anything.
Armando Pimentel: Yes, Greg, the only thing I'll add is we set ourselves up for the ERCOT summer this year to be long and to take advantage of what we believe would be decent market prices. That didn't happen. We're now trying to figure out what to do for 2013 and 2014, but it's very likely that we're going to be in a very similar position in Texas. And that is hoping that our assets take advantage of higher prices during the summer. If that does not happen, then you are obviously going to give up some of the upside that you would have otherwise been able to get because you're going to leave some assets open, hoping for those prices. And when they don't come in, you're going to get lower margins. I think, most of -- if I remember correctly, there were a lot of days in ERCOT this year where real-time prices cleared with a three handle. And that not a 300-handle, that was a 30-handle, which is certainly not what we were expecting.
Moray P. Dewhurst: And one of the consequences is that there are fewer opportunities available for what we call our asset optimization activity. So I feel very good about the way we structured the portfolio to protect against the extreme conditions and the balance that we struck there. So that was fine. But if you don't have just the regular short-term periods of volatility, there's less you can do with the assets. And I don't know, roughly to scale it, maybe with all of that -- if it had been a more normal summer, we will have like $0.04 or $0.05 perhaps probably more of income from the Texas segment. I don't know if that helps you.
Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: No, that helps a lot. So it sounds like you'd be positioned next summer very similarly to the way you were positioned this summer. So if you have a mild summer again next year, we wouldn't see a big pullback in profitability on the put side. If we saw a tight summer, you'd have some upside?
Moray P. Dewhurst: I think that's fair, very fair.
Operator: We'll go next to Michael Worms with BMO Capital Markets.
Michael S. Worms - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: With regard to all of the equity units done this year, will there be any need for equity in 2013?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Not based on the backlog-only scenario, the capital plans that we have today. Obviously, to the extent that we are successful in adding significantly to the capital profile going forward, we have to make sure that we have the balance sheet strength to support that. But based on what we see today, which is, of course, the capital program that supports the earnings expectations out through 2014, we're in good shape on the equity front, the balance sheet.
Michael S. Worms - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Great. And one other question, if I can follow up. Can you give us an update of what's going on in Spain with your project?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Sure. Let me ask Armando. He's much closer to that than I am.
Armando Pimentel: In Spain, over the last 6 weeks or so, there's been a proposed regulation/law that would really affect all of the energy providers in Spain, not just the project that we're interested in, obviously, which is a CSP solar project that we hope to get half of it in operations in the first quarter of '13 and the second half, no later than the third quarter of '13. The 2 pieces of the legislation that affect us are 6% essentially revenue tax, and that really affects all energy providers in Spain. The second piece is a reduction in the amount of natural gas that we would be able to burn at the plant, which is really one of the key items that helped us with the investment decision and help others with their investment decisions over in Spain when they were dealing with solar thermal plants. But a reduction in the amount of gas that could be used, a pretty significant reduction. If you look at both of those and if you assume for a second that there are no changes to that legislation before it becomes final later this year or earlier this year, that's a reduction in our expectations of -- I mean, it's a significant reduction for the project of roughly $0.03 to $0.04 on an EPS basis, which is not that significant obviously to the overall corporation. But we continue to be very aggressive in what we do in Spain on both the political and regulatory front and we're certainly hoping that there is a better outcome. But if there is not a better outcome, that's essentially the effect that we would see going forward.
Operator: We'll go next to Jay Dobson with Wunderlich Securities.
James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division: Armando, continuing on Spain, I remember the project financing there left the lenders with some exposure. I assume the 6% revenue tax and the limit on natural gas would not trigger that. So essentially, all of those changes would be for next year's account?
Armando Pimentel: That's correct. The best way to think about it, these projects -- we were very well-protected and certainly love the financing that we did, but we are very close now to COD on these projects. So the net result, if all of this, the proposed law gets to final, it might be that we have to put a little bit more equity into the project. And by a little bit, I do mean a little bit. Maybe in the neighborhood of $40 million to $50 million or so, certainly not significant. But the reality is that we will likely, with this proposed law, finish our projects, own the projects and very likely get to the perm part of that mini perm loan sometime later next year or early 2014.
James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division: Got you. And so simply, just realizing lower profitability than you might have expected otherwise?
Armando Pimentel: Correct.
James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division: Perfect. Moray, I was hoping to go back to Texas just briefly and follow-up on the earlier question. When you look at the results from 2011 third quarter, I think you spent the better part of a couple of months evaluating your policies there. And then sometime in the fourth quarter suggested you were changing them to go into the third quarter of '12 much longer. As a result of what you experienced in the third quarter, would you anticipate any changes in the policy? Or pursuant to the question you answered earlier, is there's simply no change and we should anticipate you would go into the third quarter of '13 with the same policy, again being sort of longer than you might otherwise have been in '11.
Moray P. Dewhurst: Yes. Let me try to explain that. There were a couple of things that really changed coming out of -- lessons learned from last year. One was really, I'll say strictly internal coordination, and we've now got a, I think, a much tighter approach to the tactical management of the aggregate position in Texas on a weekly and daily basis. So that's been a good thing, that's worked very well for us this year. The second thing that we did was that we shifted the mix a little bit more. We left a little more open on the gas plants and protected ourselves against some extreme conditions. So on that side, what you might call the policy side, obviously, we will review that as we prepare for the next summer season then tweak it, I'm sure somewhat. But that basic structure, I think, served well. And so that's not the reason that we were a little disappointed in the outcome in Texas. So that structurally did what it was intended to do. The reason we were a little disappointed in the outcome is simply that there wasn't enough volatility and pricing movement to get what we would normally have expected primarily out of the gas assets. So from a policies perspective, we'll revise and tweak, but won't fundamentally change it.
James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division: Okay, great. That's really helpful. And then can you remind us the revised cost of the nuclear uprates at P&L?
Moray P. Dewhurst: About 3.1 is where we are right now.
James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division: Got you. And that's reflective of the revised megawatts you referenced in your prepared comments.
Moray P. Dewhurst: That's correct.
Operator: Thank you for your participation. That does conclude today's conference.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the NextEra Energy 2012 Second Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Julie Holmes, Director of Investor Relations for NextEra Energy Inc. Please go ahead.
Julie Holmes: Thank you, Audra. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Joining us this morning are Jim Robo, President and Chief Operating Officer of NextEra Energy; Moray Dewhurst, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; Armando Pimentel, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources, LLC; and Eric Silagy, President of Florida Power & Light Company. Moray will provide an overview of our results, following which, Jim will touch on our strategy for future growth. We will be making statements during this call that are forward looking. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release, in the comments made during this conference call, in the Risk Factors section of the accompanying presentation or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website, nexteraenergy.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. Please also note that today's presentation includes references to adjusted earnings, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying this presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of the non-GAAP measure to the closest GAAP financial measure. With that, I will turn the call over to Moray.
Moray P. Dewhurst: Thank you, Julie. Good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy delivered solid results during the second quarter of 2012 and built on the progress made in the first quarter. The company remains on track to achieve the goals we outlined for this year, and we believe we are well positioned to attain our longer-range expectations. At FPL, we continue to invest in the business at a record rate to deliver even more value to our customers. Regulatory capital employed grew $3.7 billion or 17.5% versus the second quarter of 2011, and we recorded a regulatory ROE of 11%, consistent with the 2010 settlement agreement. As a result, our net income increased $52 million compared with the same quarter last year. Energy Resources' contribution to adjusted earnings in the second quarter increased $0.04 compared with the same quarter last year. Contributions from new investments helped offset declines from our existing assets, which stemmed primarily from below-average wind resource this quarter versus above-average wind resource in the second quarter of 2011. Overall, we continue development on the renewables projects in our backlog and remain on track for the goals we laid out at the beginning of the year. In Florida, the early signs of economic recovery we witnessed in prior quarters appear to have slowed. After significant employment growth in late 2011, Florida's pace of job creation has slowed. The Florida unemployment rate in June was flat compared to May, but has dropped more than 2% since this time last year. Consumer confidence in Florida increased in June relative to last year, but declined versus the prior month. We saw an uptick in tourism taxable sales, which are now trending above the levels seen prior to the recession, and the housing market continues to show signs of modest improvement. Notwithstanding the somewhat hesitant recovery, we continue to invest in the business to provide greater value for our customers and to keep our overall bills low. We are making major investments to modernize our generation fleet and increase our nuclear generation output to be more efficient, to reduce emissions and to drive down fuel costs for customers. Over the lives of these projects, we expect that fuel and other savings will more than offset the capital and operating costs of these projects. At Energy Resources, our focus has been on executing the plans for our record backlog of renewables projects. All of our projects continue to proceed with no significant changes in the execution timeline. As a result of the progress we have made in the first half of the year, our overall financial expectations remain about the same as we previously discussed. For 2012, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.35 to $4.65, and for 2014, we continue to see a range of $5.05 to $5.65, subject to all the usual caveats we provide, including normal weather and operating conditions. Let's now look at our results for the second quarter of 2012. I'll start with the results at FPL before moving on to Energy Resources and then the consolidated numbers. For the second quarter of 2012, FPL reported net income of $353 million or $0.85 per share, up $0.13 per share year-over-year. The principal driver of FPL's earnings growth was continued investment in the business. During the quarter, we invested roughly $1.1 billion of the approximately $4.1 billion that we expect to invest in the business in 2012, and regulatory capital employed, that is capital on which we are able to earn a return, grew 17.5% over the same quarter last year. During the quarter, we amortized $165 million of surplus depreciation, enabling us to maintain a regulatory ROE of 11%. For the full year, we expect to amortize approximately $500 million of surplus depreciation, after which, there will remain roughly $200 million to be amortized. As we stated last quarter, utilization of $190 million of the surplus in 2013 is built into our rate case filing. As we've discussed on previous calls, FPL is in the midst of the largest capital deployment phase in its history. In the second quarter, we received approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, or NRC, for power uprates on Turkey Point units 3 and 4, and earlier this month, we received NRC approval for the uprate at Unit 1 of our St. Lucie nuclear facility. St. Lucie Unit 2 is currently moving through the approval process, and we expect to receive NRC approval in the third quarter of this year. In total, these 4 projects are expected to contribute approximately 490 megawatts of additional clean generation capacity, which, in turn, will drive down customer's fuel cost. The modernizations at our Cape Canaveral and Riviera Beach facilities are progressing as planned. The projects are anticipated to come into service in mid-2013 and 2014, respectively, and are expected to provide $850 million to $950 million in total present value cost savings to our customers over the lives of the plants. We experienced the first storms of the season in the second quarter, with our service territory being affected by Tropical Storms Beryl and Debby. Tropical Storm Debby drenched the west coast of Florida for days before passing through the state. And through the hard work of our employees, power was restored to 99% of the impacted customers within 24 hours. In Florida, most economic indicators we follow have improved significantly from the trough of the recession. However, we are seeing symptoms that the recovery is slowing here in Florida, just as it seems to be for the nation as a whole. As we've repeatedly noted, we do not believe Florida will see a full recovery until the rest of the country sees more consistent signs of growth. Many of the metrics we focus on have recently flattened, creating a level of uncertainty around what we had hoped was evidence of a sustained economic recovery. In June, the Florida unemployment rate was 8.6%, unchanged from the prior month. On a positive note, the gap between the unemployment rate in Florida and the U.S. has narrowed, and Florida is now just 0.4% worse than the national rate. Looking to job creation, in June, 70,900 new jobs were reported in Florida compared to the same month in 2011. While the improvement in the job market has slowed recently, almost all residential housing statistics point to a continued recovery in Florida. Mortgage delinquencies continue to drop and are at their lowest level since 2008. The inventory of existing homes for sale reported by Florida realtors is at its lowest point in more than 4 years. As Florida reduces the inventory of existing homes, more room is made for the addition of new homes, and we are seeing that trend manifest in the housing permit data. In May, housing permits increased 58% year-over-year, the largest annual increase in roughly 2 years, although, of course, on a very low base. While the mortgage and housing data are encouraging, continued employment gains, declining unemployment rates and improvement in the national economy are important to the sustainability of housing market improvements. We will monitor these and other data points, but we continue to believe Florida will provide above-average growth opportunities over the long term. Our customer metrics at FPL are naturally tied to the pace of economic recovery, both in Florida and nationally. With the recent lull in recovery, our customer metrics appear to have stabilized for the moment. During the second quarter, we had approximately 27,000 more customers than in the comparable quarter of 2011, representing an increase of 0.6%. This growth rate has been fairly consistent for the last 9 quarters. And while we are encouraged by continued customer growth, we, of course, would like to see the pace of that growth improve over time. Underlying usage increased for the third consecutive quarter, up 1.7% over the same quarter last year. We are particularly encouraged by increases in underlying usage in the residential sector. The commercial sector, however, seems to be lagging a bit. We still hesitate to extrapolate underlying usage growth to a broader context as usage over time can be volatile. The number of inactive meters and the percentage of low-usage customers, which are indicative of the number of empty homes, declined in June versus the same period last year, but were relatively flat compared to May. Overall, our key customer metrics continue to improve, albeit more slowly than we would like. As you recall in the first quarter, we formally filed a request for base rate increase and submitted testimony, along with extensive supporting documentation, for FPL's 2012 base rate case. We requested a base revenue increase of $516.5 million, effective the beginning of January 2013, with an additional step increase of $173.9 million when the Canaveral modernization comes into service in June 2013. Included in these amounts is our request to reset the allowed ROE to 11.25%, plus a 25-basis-point performance adder, designed to recognize FPL's excellent overall customer value, but to be maintained only so long as FPL's typical bill remains the lowest in the state. The quality of service hearings will conclude in August, and intervenor and staff testimony have been filed. We will be submitting rebuttal testimony next week. The technical hearing will begin in late August, and we expect a staff recommendation and commission ruling on revenue requirements and rates in the fourth quarter. The rate case, thus far, is proceeding much as we expected, with intervenor testimony and consumer sentiment in line with what we had anticipated. As we have previously stated, at its core, the rate case boils down to 3 issues: recovering the capital and operating costs for Cape Canaveral, a plant that we expect will more than pay for itself over its lifetime through fuel savings; addressing the impact of the accelerated amortization of surplus depreciation ordered by the prior commission and implemented under the 2010 rate agreement; and resetting the allowed ROE to a more reasonable level than the current 10%. We remain open to the possibility of resolving the issues addressed in the rate case through settlement, but our focus is on preparing for the technical hearing in August. We continue to believe our superior customer value, demonstrated by award-winning customer service, high reliability and the lowest average residential bill in the state provides strong support for our request. If our request is granted, our typical residential bill is expected to remain the lowest in the state, emphasizing the affordability of our service. In April, we updated our expected total bill impact to reflect revised estimated fuel prices, costs for ongoing construction of upgrades at our Florida nuclear facilities and adjusted data related to the requested base rate increase. Based on the April data, the base portion of a typical residential customer's bill is expected to increase by $7.09 per month or roughly $0.23 per day, while the total bill impact would be just $1.41 per month or $0.05 per day, which is lower than we initially projected. Some commercial customers are likely to see their total bills go down. We will continue to monitor the changing bill impact throughout the rate case process if fuel prices fluctuate. Regardless of the level of fuel prices, our investments in high-efficiency generation will mean fuel savings for our customers. Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported second quarter 2012 GAAP earnings of $251 million or $0.60 per share. Adjusted earnings for the second quarter were $173 million or $0.41 per share. Adjusted earnings exclude the effect of the mark on non-qualifying hedges and net other than temporary impairments on certain investments, or OTTI. Overall, Energy Resources' contribution to adjusted EPS increased $0.04 year-over-year, driven primarily by contributions from new additions. Earnings from existing assets declined $0.09 versus the second quarter last year, due in large part to less favorable wind resource when compared to the same quarter last year. This decrease was offset by the fact that last year's second quarter results were reduced by $0.08 from asset impairment charges. All other effects were minor, as shown in the accompanying slide. We continue to execute on our backlog of renewables projects, with the remainder of our 1,300 megawatts of U.S. wind on track to come into service in the latter portion of the year. Our solar projects continue to make good progress with no significant changes to our expected in-service dates. In Spain, we are closely following the actions of the government but have no official word yet on a course of action. Looking at the company on a consolidated basis. For the second quarter of 2012, NextEra Energy's GAAP net income was $607 million or $1.45 per share. NextEra Energy's 2012 second quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $527 million and $1.26, respectively. The Corporate & Other segment was down $0.09 from the same quarter last year when we experienced an uplift, primarily due to consolidated income tax adjustments related to state tax law changes. Separately, our Lone Star transmission project remains on track, and we continue to expect to bring the line into full service in the spring of 2013. As we evaluate our growth for the balance of the year and into 2013, we remain focused on maintaining solid credit metrics. As we have previously discussed, we consider our credit rating important and a competitive advantage in this market. We are committed to a strong cash position and to sourcing the right mix of financial products in order to maintain our rating. We presented the principles underlying our approach to managing our balance sheet and credit position at our Fixed Income investor conference in May, the presentations from which are posted on our website. As stated there, both Energy Resources and FPL are in the largest investment phase either have seen in recent history, and this places stress on our balance sheet and credit metrics. We expect to continue accessing a diverse group of financial instruments to support our growth plans and maintain our balance sheet strength. As we've noted, we expect our credit metrics to improve as we move into 2013 and 2014, but it is important to maintain our strength in 2012 as well. We expect to issue another round of equity units later in the year, although at this point, we have not determined what the aggregate amount should be. We may go above the upper end of the range of $500 million to $1 billion that we have previously disclosed. However, whatever amount we choose to issue is not expected to have a material impact on the EPS expectations that we have shared with you for 2012 and 2014. Our development team continues to look for growth opportunities in the market, but absent additional investment, we continue to expect to be free cash flow positive in 2014. As we stated earlier this year, we are targeting a 55% dividend payout ratio in 2014 as a consequence of the mix of our portfolio continuing to shift towards more regulated and long-term contracted assets. This translates into a compound annual growth rate for dividends of approximately 10% using a 2011 base. Separately, we have received a number of questions on differential membership interest transactions, also known as tax equity. In an effort to provide more detail around how these structures work, the benefits they provide to us and the impact on our financial statements, we have posted a presentation on our Investor Relations website. We encourage you to examine this and follow up with additional questions. In light of the results achieved year-to-date and the progress made against our execution objectives, we see no reason to change our EPS expectations for this year or for the longer term. We continue to expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $4.35 to $4.65 for 2012, and for 2014, we currently see a range of $5.05 to $5.65. As always, our expectations are subject to the usual caveats we provide, including normal weather and operating conditions. While we have not looked as deeply at the numbers beyond 2014, we also expect to maintain our growth momentum into 2015 with continued contributions from new assets expected to come into service at both FPL and Energy Resources. From a commodity perspective, we're highly hedged in 2015 as well. Note that our financial expectations take into account current market conditions, and we are not depending on or anticipating any great strengthening in the natural gas market. As we do each quarter, we have updated our 2012 and 2013 equivalent hedged gross margin slides for Energy Resources, and they can be found in the appendix to the presentation. There were no significant changes compared to the first quarter earnings release. To reiterate what we've said in the past, our financial expectations do not include any additional U.S. wind build beyond 2012 due to the uncertainties surrounding the extension of the production tax credit after the end of this year. We continue to be optimistic that the PTC will reemerge in some form, following this year's election, and should that be the case, any investment in U.S. wind beyond 2012 would contribute upside to our current expectations. Before taking your questions, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim Robo. As you know, Jim assumed the CEO role at the beginning of the month, having served as Chief Operating Officer for nearly 6 years and having led Energy Resources for 4 years before that. Jim?
James L. Robo: Thanks, Moray, and good morning, everyone. It gives me great pleasure to talk to you in my new role. Moray has given you an overview of another solid quarter for our company, and I won't repeat his comments. Instead, I want to say a few words about our future. I know a number of you have asked whether you should expect any changes in strategy under a new CEO, and I'm sure all of you will appreciate any insight I can give you into our plans for the future. The short answer to the question about strategy is that I expect our strategy to be consistent, but our implementation will need to adapt, as it has repeatedly in the past, to changes in the outside world. At Florida Power & Light, the core of our strategy has been, for many years, to strive constantly to improve the value we deliver to our customers. Today, FPL offers its residential customers a bill that is 25% below the national average and the lowest typical bill of all 55 utilities in the state of Florida, coupled with top quartile reliability, award-winning customer service and a very clean emissions profile. We are investing heavily in the business to ensure our value delivery gets even better over time. We expect that our investments in new generation will save customers fuel costs and improve our emissions profile, that investments in our transmission and distribution infrastructure will increase our systems resiliency and reliability and that investments in advanced meters will offer customers more feedback in control of their electricity usage, as well as make our internal procedures more efficient. If we receive fair and balanced treatment through the regulatory process, our investors will benefit along with our customers. At Energy Resources, our strategy is not as easy to capture in a few words, but it has always reflected a balance between a steady view of a long-term vision, captured succinctly by loose terms, scale, skills, scale and scope and a pragmatic recognition that every goal in the competitive power space must be pursued opportunistically. A decade and more of sustained effort has led to the creation of a business that is not only the largest renewable energy producer in the country but one that also contains many other business capabilities, all linked together by a strong economic logic. We will seek ways to continue to build the business, subject to the opportunity set that the external world offers us. Across both businesses, I expect us to maintain our focus on clean energy, on being low cost and on maintaining our track record of excellent execution. In addition, underpinning our success in both our major businesses has been an important competitive weapon, our balance sheet. We have long been believers in the need for financial strength in this capital-intensive cyclical business, and I do not expect that to change. We have also combined our financial strength with a culture of financial discipline and a commitment to strong risk management. That, too, will not change. I do not claim that we have never made mistakes nor that we never will in the future. But I do believe our discipline and risk management have served us well in the past and will continue to serve us well going forward. As a new CEO, I consider myself very fortunate. I have been an integral part of all the major decisions of the past decade that got us to where we are today, so I understand the situation I'm presented with. Our business, overall, is in great shape, and I can concentrate immediately on 2 things: continued execution against the practical objectives listed on this slide that will see us grow out through the middle of this decade and putting in place the building blocks for new initiatives that will help us carry that growth into and through the second half of the decade. This is not the occasion for a detailed discussion of our plans for 2016 and beyond, other than to say that we feel comfortable that the company has an attractive set of growth opportunities going forward. I look forward to the opportunity to speak with you in more depth on this subject at the various conferences that some of you will be hosting in the fall and at our next investor conference, which we are tentatively scheduling for late in the year. To close, I'd like to remind you of our track record over the last decade under Lew's leadership. During that period, we have significantly outperformed the relevant industry benchmarks, as well as the S&P 500 index and, in the process have added more than $24 billion in value, $18 billion through price appreciation and more than $6 billion through dividends. That value creation is a tribute to Lew's leadership and to the hard work of all our NextEra Energy employees. Not the least of Lew's achievements has been the development of the team that has been responsible for delivering these results. I am fortunate to have that team with me today, ready to meet the challenges of the next decade. We are all fully committed to seeing that we continue our long-term track record of outperformance. Thank you for your continued support of our company, and Moray and I now look forward to taking your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Dan Eggers at Credit Suisse.
Dan Eggers - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: To ask my first question is, there wasn't any changes to the backlog for wind and solar in the quarter. But could you just share a little color on opportunities you may be seeing and where the conversations are going, as far as maybe adding more solar projects over the remainder of this year into the backlog?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Sure. Let me ask Armando to address that.
Armando Pimentel: Great. Dan, we're certainly seeing some opportunities in the market, both on a short-term basis and on a longer-term basis. I'm not ready to talk about specifics of what those might be on the short term. But on the longer-term basis, during the quarter, you did see us close on a $10 million purchase of 1,000 megawatt area out in California, which supports 4 250-megawatt sites. There's no power purchase agreement associated with those sites, but those sites do bring some very favorable transmission and resource adequacy to our portfolio. We're out looking for power purchase agreement at this point, and we're hopeful that we would have something to talk about at some point next year. In the near term, I will say that the uncertainty over production tax credits moving forward in 2013 and 2014 is creating some opportunities, both here in the U.S. and Canada, that we are taking a look at closely.
Dan Eggers - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Armando, does that mean that there's people looking to sell, develop their in-process projects, or just that you're seeing people actually willing to assign contracts on things for '13 and '14?
Armando Pimentel: Actually, we're -- both. We're seeing a few opportunities of folks, some developers that have projects that have taken pretty far into the development process, but their uncertainty regarding production tax credits in 2013 and 2014 is making them seek some additional capital outside of what they have. But we're also seeing not as much, and we -- and Moray has talked about this before. We and others are building a significant amount of renewables in the U.S. in 2012. It should be a record year for the industry and a record year for us. That has certainly sapped some of the 2013 demand, even if there is an extension of the production tax credit. But we are seeing some of our customers ask for quotes and bids on 2013 and 2014 both on a contingent PTC basis and on a noncontingent PTC basis.
Dan Eggers - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: I guess, Moray, just one question on tax equity. You guys said you're going to be -- start being a cash tax payer in '14. Does that mean you guys are done in the tax equity market for the time being, given the fact you have visibility now to kind of get into the excess backlog?
Moray P. Dewhurst: No, that continues to be the balance that we've talked about before that we need to strike between, essentially, the incremental cost that you pay through a differential partnership deal versus the present value benefit of pulling forward in time when you would otherwise realize tax credits. So that trade-off exists almost regardless of when you expect that cash tax position to flip around. Obviously, the closer in it is, the less valuable the tax equity power will be. But you should not assume that, that means that we won't be doing more transactions.
Operator: And next, we'll move to Michael Lapides at Goldman Sachs.
Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Two things. One, just kind of a little bit of a housekeeping in Florida and then the other Spain. In Florida, did the storms that occur, I think it was late last month, have an impact on O&M? And if so, could you quantify kind of -- did it increase -- how much did it increase O&M versus kind of expectation? And then second, you made a comment, Moray, about the waiting to hear about the Spanish government regarding the project there. Can you just give a little more detail?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Yes. On the FPL O&M, not material. On Spain, as I think many of you are aware, there have been a whole variety of proposals, is probably too strong a word, but possibilities floated around trial balloons. Some of which we believe had some basis in fact, some of which we're not sure have any basis in fact. But certainly, there are discussions about the potential for taxing the energy sector, either in aggregate or, differentially, by technology. And clearly, to the extent that our project was subject to an excise tax or something of that nature, that would affect the economics. We just don't have enough insight at this stage to know which way the government is going to go or how significant those might be. It seems pretty clear that if the impact was limited to what it needed to address the tariff deficit within the electricity sector, that could be achieved with, should we say, levels of pain that are tolerable. If the government seeks to -- really to try and attack a portion of the broader fiscal deficit on the backs of the energy sector, then that could have a different impact. So as I say, we're sort of monitoring the thing. We're staying close to it. Obviously, we are articulating our viewpoint, as is everybody else there, and we just have to wait and see.
Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Do you have the ability to pull back on the project if the -- I would say, the operating or the government environment for renewables there turns against you?
Moray P. Dewhurst: In principle, we always have that ability, but we're well along in construction. We still like the project. We think it's going to be a good project. So I think it would have to be a fairly extreme situation for us to sort of completely reverse course. I think what we're talking about is what is the impact on the economics, and more broadly, what's -- what is the impact on our view of Spain as a place to do business and invest for the capital in the future.
Operator: Well, next is Stephen Byrd at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney.
Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: I wonder if you could just talk to the appetite for the development of a regional natural gas transmission pipeline. I know that's been a potential topic of discussion in the past. Just curious, in your conversations, how that's progressing.
Moray P. Dewhurst: Well, as we've discussed several times before, we continue to believe that there is need for-- a good case to be made for a third pipeline into Florida. I don't really have a lot to update you on. We've said before that we are optimistic that we'll be able to be in a position to come forward later in the year with more specifics. We're continuing to evaluate a bunch of different possible scenarios on that, I think getting closer to what we think makes the most sense. But I think timing is still, hopefully, later in the year for us to be more explicit about that.
Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Understood. And just shifting the Texas. In your conversations in the state and with ERCOT, could you give us a sense for the degree of appetite that you see for consideration of a capacity-like mechanism to ensure that the market isn't -- is adequately incenting folks to build new plants in the state?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Well, I'm not sure we want to mention the capacity word, but some reliability supplementary payment mechanism may be appropriate. Let me ask Armando to comment on that.
Armando Pimentel: Yes, there's been a ton of discussion obviously, and there's proposals on the table at ERCOT that folks are responding to. My sense is that the word capacity -- let's take the word out. The mechanisms that would allow payments to be made to generators, hopefully to support the generation and to bring new generation into the area, which is clearly needed in 2014, both by ERCOT's estimates and by ours estimates, that it's moving along more favorably, I'll say, than it was over the last 6 months. That doesn't mean that there's going to be a capacity market. But as Moray pointed out, we are hopeful that there will be some mechanism that recognizes that generators need an incentive in order to build new generation. So I'm hopeful that there will be changes. But in the near term, for 2013 and 2014, ERCOT is, frankly, short of capacity.
Moray P. Dewhurst: And, Stephen, let me just supplement that with -- noting that without that supplementary reliability payment, you get a market that is either very flat, as it has been so far this summer, because there really hasn't been much tightness, or a market which peaks out and induces a lot of stress for a short period of time with consequent trouble for suppliers and customers alike. We don't think that that's a very functional structure. So getting some more supplementary capacity into the market clearly would be a good thing long term for customers.
Operator: Next, we'll go to Jonathan Arnold at Deutsche Bank.
Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Just curious on the Resources results, you called out an $8 -- it's an $0.08 -- the absence of the $0.08 impairment charge from last year is one of the drivers, I believe, in the $0.09 interest G&A and other. There seems to be like a $57 million gain on disposals in the quarter. Can you -- as well. Could you shed any light on was that one specific item or a number of items, and what's the right tax rate we should be using on that?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Yes, sure. It's a number of items. We did have a small gain, a few million dollars on the sale of a project. But the bulk of it is associated with the decommissioning funds and, actually, more than half of it, this may get a little technical, but is effectively not included in our adjusted earnings because it's an offset to OTTI that we previously took out of adjusted earnings in prior periods. In other words, we -- in a prior period, we, for GAAP purposes, marked down certain securities in the nuclear decommissioning trusts, because we didn't have substantive evidence that they would recover. But in fact, they have recovered. We have sold them now at a gain in the course of the regular management of the NDTs. And so we can't, in fairness, take a -- that gain into adjusted earnings when we took the negative, but it's now offsetting out of adjusted earnings. So more than half of that actually is netted out and is in -- is a reversal in the OTTI piece. There is a little piece that's real gains on just the normal transactions in the decommissioning trust. That's what's going on there.
Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: So where does that reversal show up? Sorry, Moray, I'm not following that.
Moray P. Dewhurst: It shows up in the reconciliation between GAAP earnings and adjusted earnings, down below in the OTTI piece. So the OTTI adjustment has a different sign than it typically has. We can follow up, take you through the numbers later on, if you like.
Operator: We'll go next to Hugh Wynne at Sanford Bernstein.
Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: I had just 2 quick questions on the Florida Power & Light side of the business. In your estimates of the base rate impact of the rate request that you put to the commission. You estimate also the savings to the customers from lower fuel cost. Can you share the expected sensitivity of customer bills to a $1 move in the price of natural gas?
Moray P. Dewhurst: I don't have that off the top of my head. We'd be happy to follow up and take a rough crack at it. I mean, it's a little hard to see because it filters through. It depends on your assumptions about the dispatch of a fleet. So typically, when we come up with these estimates, we're making up -- we're hypothetically dispatching the fleet against the forward curve, so we don't have that sort of sensitivity ready to hand. But we'll follow up with you on that.
Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Okay. And then the second question, regarding the target higher dividend payout ratio, which you point out is associated with a shift to a greater earnings contribution from your regulated and contracted businesses. Ordinarily there, the payout ratio, I think, is also a decision that's taken in light of the capital requirements of those businesses and the growth in their asset base. Based on '14 rate base growth, it would seem to me that longer term, there's an expectation of something like 3.5% growth in FPL rate base. But I wanted to ask you what was the assumption that you factored into that 55% dividend payout decision.
Moray P. Dewhurst: Well, the board feel comfortable with targeting the 55% in 2014, based fundamentally on the mix shift and a view of a range of possibilities for where we might be going beyond that. So you mentioned the 3.5% number. I don't think we have enough insight today to really know what the growth in rate base might be beyond 2014. But we felt that 55% was sufficiently conservative. That under most of the likely scenarios, we would still be able to fund the growth without having to resort too much to sort of just coming to the capital markets in order to raise capital, in order to pay the dividend, if you see what I mean. So I don't have a specific expectation going out. But I think if you look at how we derived, in essence, the 55% number, it was a function of saying, okay, what do fully regulated businesses typically pay out in terms of payout ratio, what's the range there. What sort of payout ratio is supportable by a business that is fundamentally around long-term contracts, that's obviously a lower amount, and then what's the payout ratio for a business that has merchant assets, which is essentially 0, and we then weight average those. So in a sense, it's what should be a sustainable payout ratio based on the portfolio mix as it will be in 2014. So going beyond that, if that mix itself changes radically beyond 2014, that might cause us to rethink that for future years.
Operator: We'll go next to Steven Fleishman at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Just, Moray, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you might go above the high end on the equity units offering for the year. Could you just give some sense on what -- if so, what would be driving that? Is that a function of more investment opportunities that you're seeing? Is that a function of the stock price? Just...
Moray P. Dewhurst: It's more a function of the sort of tactical issues around where we're likely to come out on cash flow, making sure that we have enough liquidity through the end of the year, making sure that the cash balances are roughly where we want to be. A couple of things I would note, as we've often discussed, on the project finance side, we really like to have our projects as far along and complete and clean as they can be when we go to the project finance market, because that's how we get the best deal out of those. So given that the build here is concentrated heavily late in the year, we actually may not get to execution on some of the project finance transactions, that really are associated with the CapEx for this year, until next year. So that means we got to come up with cash in the meantime. And as I've said before, we're going to watch the 2012 metrics as well. So that's one thing. Another thing is that we have some opportunities I don't want to -- for commercial reasons, I don't want to go into details. But we have some opportunities to accelerate some capital expenditures in the year in exchange for commercial advantages, but obviously, we have to have the cash to come up with that. So that all that gets factored into the liquidity analysis and says how much cash do you need, and then obviously, you got to have a balanced mix of financing. So right now, my thinking is that we may well do another issue of comparable size to the one that we did earlier in the year. But as I said in the prepared remarks, we haven't settled on a final amount yet.
Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And then just any kind of updates on what you're seeing on -- in Washington on the PTC and I guess some of the other renewables-related legislation that has popped up?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Yes. I don't really have a lot new to report there. There continues to be a lot of discussion. I think at the margin, the discussion is proceeding in a favorable direction, by which I mean that more people are coming to recognize that it doesn't make good economic sense to cut the PTC off 100% instantly. At the same time, as I've also said many times before, we do see a strong political view to the effect that there have to be a definite end in sight for this kind of support, and that's a concept that we have indicated publicly that we can accept. Obviously, the devil is in the details. So I think we're making progress on the discussion. But we continue to believe that we're not likely to see anything really happen until after the election, and that this is just one small part of a much broader set of discussions and compromises that, again, have to be worked out after the election, so not a lot new.
Operator: We'll go next to Paul Patterson in Glenrock Associates.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Just back to Jonathan's question, just to make sure that I understand this. The $57 million of dispositions is not an adjusted earnings for the most part. Is that correct?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Yes. I would say roughly a little over half is out of adjusted earnings and a little less than half is in.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Okay. And then on the tax equity market, any thoughts we should have with respect to the tax equity market and the fiscal cliff, so to speak, for all these sort of tax adjustments that might potentially occur? Just -- could you give us any feeling for what's happening in that market, and what the outlook is there?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Well, there continues to be an active market. I can't say that the prospect of comprehensive tax reform, at least, to date, has had significant impact on the market, although that doesn't mean it couldn't in the future. So really, they're kind of separate questions at the moment. I think there's a high degree of skepticism about whether comprehensive tax reform really will occur, or if so, on what timeframe. And so at least at the moment, it hasn't had a real impact on the tax equity market.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Okay. And then finally, the situation in Spain, just to sort of put it in perspective. What is there the total exposure? I mean, I don't mean to be cataclysmic or anything. But when you read what you're hearing coming out of what the situation is in Spain, just for investors, how much is the total exposure-- if the situation were to get untenable? Just how much exposure do you have in Spain as an investor there?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Well, our equity commitment to the project is roughly EUR 300 million, but the rest has been borrowed on a nonrecourse basis against the project in euros. So ultimately, our equity commitment is of that order of magnitude. And you can figure out, obviously, by applying whatever reasonable ROE you want to that, what the potential range of earnings impact is. But that's what we're talking about.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: And then no guarantee.
Moray P. Dewhurst: I want to emphasize, at least, on everything we're hearing to date, we don't think the project is fundamentally threatened. We think the issue is around what are ultimately going to be the returns on the project.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Sure. I just wanted to get sort of sense as to -- just to put it in perspective.
Operator: We'll move next to Jay Dobson at Wunderlich Securities.
James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division: Most of my questions have been answered, but Moray, just following up on the Spain question. If I recall, there were some carve-outs in the financing that's sort of handed or pushed a little of this political risk, to sort of broadly calling it that, to the debt side of the equation. And I don't remember exactly how it works, but if you could remind us how that works. And then just with your best view, I know this is moving around a little bit, sort of how that might play into something that didn't, as you point out, fundamentally sort of eliminate the project but more challenge the economics.
Moray P. Dewhurst: Sure. I don't want to play amateur lawyer here, so I'm going to sort of simplify things pretty significantly. But the financing is -- protects us against change in tariff risk, simply put. So if there's fundamentally a change in the tariff, then the banks share in that risk. To the extent that what the government ends up talking about or imposing is simply a tax that's kind of consistent with what's already on the books or is an adjustment to an existing tax that would presumably not be a complete change in the tariff. To the extent that it was extreme, you might well argue that it was a change in tariff. So I think that's what we're talking about. Again, I think the -- realistically, we're trying to figure out what level of tax there is going to be, and hence, what the impact on the returns from the project would be. And again, I would just emphasize that, at least, our take on the numbers is that the government can solve the problem that they have with the electricity sector tariff deficit through the imposition, broadly, on the energy sector of taxes that would not have a materially negative impact on ours or many other projects in which people have committed billions of euros. But to the extent that they want to try and use this as an opportunity to help address the broader fiscal deficit that they're dealing with, then that's a different matter.
James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And how much of the EUR 300 million of your equity has been committed to date or actually funded?
Moray P. Dewhurst: I think we're -- I mean, 75%, 80%. I mean, we're well along in construction. Construction's proceeding very well. We're on target for delivering those units next year.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Andy Bischof at Morningstar Financial Services.
Andrew Bischof - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: Most of my questions have been answered, but I do have one follow-up question to the solar development in California that you purchased. Given an optimistic scenario of if you sign a PPA in 2013, could you put a possible timeframe on when you expect that development to be operational? I'm just trying to get a handle of the CapEx and when you would be spending that amount.
Armando Pimentel: Realistically, it wouldn't be before 2016, and it probably could slip beyond 2016 under some scenarios. And total CapEx would be somewhere in the neighborhood of $800 million to $900 million for one 250-megawatt project. And in the near term, I'd say that the better likelihood for modeling purposes would be one 250-megawatt project. Certainly, we would love to build out that entire 1,000-megawatt facility. But right now, I wouldn't plan on anything other than 250 in the models.
Operator: And we'll go to Ashar Khan at Visium Asset Management.
Ashar Khan: Can I just ask what's happening on the Seabrook? If -- I guess if I read today, even just running at 85%, when do you expect that to come back to 100%?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Yes. No update on Seabrook. It continues to run a little bit below full output because of the derate associated with general cooling limits. It will continue to do so through the next outage, which is scheduled for some time in the third quarter. I think it's September. So that -- I think we previously discussed the full year impact of that being reflected in the numbers. There's really been no change.
Ashar Khan: Okay. And then, Moray, can I just ask, based on the results year-to-date, it seems like you're running at least ahead of -- at least towards the top end of the range. Is that a fair thing to say that you're running a little bit ahead of, I guess, where plan would be or to indicating to a top end of the range for the year?
Moray P. Dewhurst: No, I wish that were the case. But I think right now, we're sort of right in the middle of -- it was very consistent with where we expected to be. Obviously, there's always puts and takes that'll just go one way or another. But as I say, I don't see any reason to change the range for the year, and we could end up in a variety of places in that range. We still feel pretty good about the year. But I will say that it's a very, very tough environment for the Energy Resources folks, any asset or piece of the business that's exposed to competitive market. It's just a tough market environment. So having to work very hard, as I say, scratch and claw every penny that they can get from the businesses, it's not a great market environment. But despite that, we're doing pretty well. So we're certainly pleased with where we are at this stage.
Operator: And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I'll turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.
Moray P. Dewhurst: No, thank you for being with us this morning. We look forward to addressing follow-up questions.
Operator: And that does conclude today's conference. Again, thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the NextEra Energy 2012 First Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Julie Holmes [ph], Director of Investor Relations for NextEra Energy Incorporated. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Unknown Executive: Thank you, Cecilia. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Joining us this morning are Lew Hay, NextEra Energy's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Jim Robo, President and Chief Operating Officer of NextEra Energy; Moray Dewhurst, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; Eric Silagy, President of Florida Power & Light Company; and Armando Pimentel, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources, LLC. Moray will provide an overview of our results, following which, our senior management team will be available to take your questions.  We will be making statements during this call that are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because other factors discussed in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call in the Risk Factors section of the accompanying presentation or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website, www.nexteraenergy.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements.  Please also note that today's presentation includes references to adjusted earnings, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying this presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of the non-GAAP measure to the closest GAAP financial measure.  With that, I will turn the call over to Moray.
Moray P. Dewhurst: Thank you, Julie. Good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy delivered solid results during the first quarter of 2012 and is off to a good start in meeting the objectives that we have set out for ourselves and discussed with you on our last earnings call.  At FPL, we maintained a regulatory ROE of appropriately 11%, consistent with the 2010 settlement agreement, and average regulatory capital employed grew $3.2 billion or roughly 15.6% over the same quarter last year, reflecting our continuing commitment of new capital to the business, which is designed to enhance what we believe is already the best customer value proposition in the state. As a consequence, net income grew $34 million or 16.6%.  At Energy Resources, the adjusted earnings contribution compared to the prior year comparable quarter was close to flat, as contributions from new business roughly offset declines from the existing asset portfolio. Given the headwinds facing this business that we have previously discussed, we are satisfied with this performance. More broadly, we made good progress on the various execution objectives we discussed on our last earnings call, and we remain on track to meet our goals for 2012 and beyond. In Florida, the economy continued to improve, although it is still weaker than we would all desire. Virtually, every significant indicator that we track is now appreciably improved from the trough of 2009, and this quarter showed a continuation of a general upward trend. While we continue to believe that full recovery depends in part on recovery elsewhere in the U.S., we are optimistic that Florida will, in time, revert to its longer-term pattern of greater strength than the national average.  Within a slowly improving economic environment, FPL continued to deliver what we firmly believe is the best customer value proposition in the state. Our typical bills remain the lowest of the 55 utilities in the state and about 25% below the national average. Our service reliability ranks in the top quartile on a national basis. We provide our customers with award-winning service, and we have a very clean emissions profile, which reduces risk from a customer perspective.  We continue to be one of the most efficient utilities in the nation, with our non-fuel O&M per kilowatt hour ranking us among the top 10% in operating efficiency in the nation. Our major projects at FPL, which are aimed at improving on this value proposition, all progressed well during the quarter, and we made our formal filing for rate release. Outside of Florida, the Energy Resources portfolio generally performed well, with the exception of the continued down power at Seabrook, associated with generated cooling limits, which will continue through the next regularly scheduled outage in the fall of 2012.  While gas and power markets continued to weaken, our high degree of hedging protected us against significant impacts in the first quarter and should continue to do so for many quarters to come.  We made excellent progress in developing our record backlog of renewable project and remain on track for all major commitments.  At Lone Star Transmission, we continue to make good progress with construction, and result in minor issues associated with the rate case in Texas.  Looking forward, as a result of our progress in the first quarter, we continue to believe we are well positioned to meet the earnings expectations we have previously discussed. For 2012, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.35 to $4.65, and for 2014, we see a range of $5.05 to $5.65, subject to all the usual caveats we provide, including normal weather and operating conditions.  Let's now look at our result from the first quarter of 2012. I'll start with the results at FPL before moving onto Energy Resources and then the consolidated numbers. For the first quarter of 2012, FPL reported net income of $239 million or $0.58 per share, up $0.09 per share year-over-year. The principal driver of FPL's earnings growth was continued investment in the business.  During the quarter, we invested roughly $1.3 billion of the approximately $4.1 billion we expect to invest in the business in 2012, and regulatory capital employed, that is capital in which we are able to earn a return, grew 15.6% over the same quarter last year. Given the projects currently approved by the Florida Public Service Commission and our normal pattern of investment in the business, we expect to invest roughly $15 billion over the 5-year period, 2010 through 2014, or approximately $3 billion per year. This is the largest investment wave in the company's history and is, of course, only made possible by the prospect of earning a fair rate of return on that investment. These investments collectively produce significant customer benefits in the form of lower fuel costs, better reliability and cleaner air, and they are key to our ability to keep our customer's electric bills the lowest in the state over the long haul.  All our major projects continued to make good progress during the quarter. The extended power uprate projects at our St. Lucie and Turkey Point nuclear facilities continue to move ahead. Uprates of 3 of the units are anticipated to be completed in 2012, and the uprate at the remaining unit is expected to be completed in 2013. In total, the nuclear power uprate projects are expected to add an incremental 490 megawatts of generation capacity.  Construction at the Cape Canaveral and Riviera Beach modernizations is well underway and remains on schedule and on budget. In addition, the Florida Public Service Commission approved our petition of need for the modernization of our Port Everglades facility, and we expect that project to come into service in 2016 with a total capital investment of approximately $1.2 billion.  During the quarter, we amortized $165 million of surplus depreciation, enabling us to maintain a regulatory ROE of approximately 11%. For the full year, we expect to amortize approximately $500 million of surplus depreciation, after which there will remain roughly $200 million to be amortized. Utilization of $190 million of this in 2013 is built into our rate case filing. One of the important issues in the rate case will be the need to increase rates to offset the loss of the temporary surplus depreciation amortization credit.  As I mentioned earlier, the Florida economy continues to improve. Unemployment in March dropped to 9%, still higher than the national average, but well down from the peak of 11.4% in early 2010 and lower than at any time since January 2009. Perhaps more important, Florida has now experienced positive year-over-year job creation for the last 20 months. The tourism sector has improved markedly since its trough in January of 2010. As of January 2012, the 12-month moving sum of total taxable sales from tourism stands higher than at any point over the last 5 years. At the same time, Florida consumer confidence has improved from its low in the summer of 2008, although it is still well below the levels we experienced in 2005 through 2007.  The Florida housing market continues to recover, although progress is uneven around the state. The large pipeline of homes in foreclosure remains a drag on the market, and the judicial process used in Florida to process foreclosures is one of the lengthiest in the country. Nevertheless, the backlog of homes in foreclosure is gradually declining, and the rate of mortgage delinquencies has fallen to its lowest level since 2008. Florida has improved from having the second highest mortgage delinquency rate in the country, to having the seventh highest rate.  As painful as the housing market adjustment has been and continues to be, the significant declines in housing prices have resulted in Florida regaining much of the position it had lost in terms of relative housing affordability. In markets where this adjustment has progressed rapidly, such as Miami-Dade, housing market activity has now recovered significantly and many buildings that we had thought would be unoccupied perhaps for years, are now being occupied. Prices in this market have seen a slight uptick recently.  On the negative side, construction activity, not surprisingly, continues at a very low level, and we do not expect this to change for many months. Yet even here, there are signs of improvement, and we have seen a slight uptick in permit applications for new construction.  These generally encouraging developments are reflected in the internal indicators that we follow at FPL. During the first quarter, we had approximately 27,000 more customers than in the comparable quarter of 2011, representing an increase of 0.6%. This growth rate has been fairly consistent with our last 7 quarters. Total retail sales increased 3.8%, driven largely by an extra day of sales due to leap year and an increase in underlying usage. This is the second quarter in a row with a positive year-over-year increase in underlying usage.  Positive economic factors, including increased employment in Florida and the steady drop in the number of empty homes, seem to be contributing to the increase. The number of inactive meters and low-usage customers, which are indicative of the number of empty homes, continue to improve and have now fallen to levels not seen since 2008. However, as we've often pointed out, changes in usage can be volatile from quarter-to-quarter, and we would not extrapolate from this quarter's strong growth. Over the coming months, we continue to expect modest and gradually improving growth, but there are likely to be more bumps along the way.  On March 19, we submitted testimony and extensive supporting data for FPL's 2012 base rate case. The overall numbers are substantially consistent with what we had indicated in the test year [ph] letter. We are requesting a base revenue increase of $517 million effective January 2, 2013, with an additional step increase of $174 million when the Canaveral modernization comes into service in June of 2013.  Included in these amounts is our request to reset the allowed ROE at 11.25%, off the 25 basis-point performance premium designed to recognize FPL's excellent overall customer value, but to be maintained only so long as FPL's typical bill remains the lowest in the state. The Commission has established the definitive schedule for this proceeding, which includes quality of service hearings in June, intervener staff and FPL rebuttal testimony in July, and technical hearings in late August. The staff recommendation and commission rulings on revenue requirements and rates are expected in the fourth quarter.  In our March filing with the Commission, we indicated that, if granted in full, our base rate request would result in an increase in the base portion of a typical residential customer's bill of $6.97 per month or roughly $0.23 per day. However, the impact on total bills would be substantially less. Based on February fuel curves at the time of our filing, we estimated that the typical bill would increase by only $2.48 per month or $0.08 per day, and we noted that some commercial customers would likely see their total bills go down.  We are currently in the process of updating our bill impact analysis, which we expect to result in a further decrease in the total bill impact. We will continue to monitor the changing bill impact throughout the rate case process as fuel prices fluctuate.  The interrelationship between the base rate request and the customer's total bill is an important one, but it is sometimes misunderstood. While fluctuations in natural gas prices will certainly be reflected in corresponding fluctuations in our customer's total bills, as a consequence of our focus on substituting capital for fuel, our customers stand to benefit whatever the level of fuel prices, and the value of the investments we are making would only increase still further if natural gas prices were to increase again.  The nearly 10,000 employees of FPL have worked hard and thoughtfully for many years, following a consistent strategy that has led to FPL's current combination of low bills, high reliability and excellent customer service. While we are far from perfect and must continue to seek ways to improve, we look forward to presenting our case to the Florida Public Service Commission.  Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported first quarter 2012 GAAP earnings of $221 million or $0.53 per share. Adjusted earnings for the first quarter were $182 million or $0.44 per share. Adjusted earnings exclude the effect of the mark on non-qualifying hedges and net other than temporary impairments on certain investments or OTTI. Overall, Energy Resources' contribution was close to flat with last year, with adjusted EPS decreasing $0.02. While the quarters saw the typical collection of puts and takes, there are only a few items worth drawing your attention to. New wind investments added to the portfolio since the first quarter of last year, contributed $0.07, reflecting both higher convertible investment tax credit or CITC elections, as well as ongoing operating earnings. We continue to expect to elect CITCs on roughly 450 megawatts of new project that are expected to be placed into service in 2012.  The company's gas infrastructure business also added $0.07 of adjusted EPS, $0.06 of which is from gains associated with closing out hedges on certain planned wells that we no longer intend to pursue. These positive results were offset by lower adjusted EPS from the company's existing assets at $0.11. Existing wind assets decreased $0.07 relative to last year's comparable quarter, due to a combination of favorable state tax credits recorded last year, as well as lower Federal production tax credits, lower energy prices and higher operating expenses. These items were partially offset by favorable wind energy production. Net wind energy generation increased by 545,000-megawatt hours compared to last year's comparable quarter, and the wind resource was about equal to the long-term average.  At our Seabrook nuclear facility, lower availability and lower gains from decommissioning funds negatively impacted adjusted EPS by $0.04. All other remaining items contributed a negative $0.05 and reflect lower contributions from the company's customer supply and proprietary trading business and higher cost associated with the growth of the business.  Given the challenging market environment for Energy Resources, we were satisfied with the overall performance. Nevertheless, the bulk of the year is still ahead of us and much more work remains to be done.  We continue to make good progress in developing our record backlog of renewable projects. During the quarter, we brought into service 177 megawatts of wind capacity and completed the acquisition of 40 megawatts of solar capacity in Canada. We currently expect to add approximately 1,300 megawatts of U.S. wind capacity this year, roughly 600 megawatts of contracted wind capacity in Canada in 2012 through 2015, and roughly 900 megawatts of contracted solar capacity between 2012 and 2016. All our major projects are on track to meet their respective commitments.  Looking at the company on a consolidated basis, for the first quarter of 2012, NextEra Energy's GAAP net income was $461 million or $1.11 per share. NextEra Energy's 2012 first quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $422 million and $1.02, respectively. The corporate and other segment was essentially flat with last year. As I noted earlier, we are on track with Lone Star Transmission and continue to expect to bring the line into full service in the spring of 2013.  As I indicated earlier, with the progress we have made in the first quarter, we continue to be comfortable with the earnings expectations we discussed on our last call. For 2012, we currently expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $4.35 to $4.65, while for 2014, we currently see a range of $5.05 to $5.65. As always, our expectations are subject to the usual caveats we provide, including normal weather and operating conditions.  While we have not looked as deeply at the numbers beyond 2014, we also expect to maintain our growth momentum into 2015 with continued contributions from new assets coming into service at both FPL and Energy Resources.  From a commodity perspective, we are highly hedged in 2015 as well. As always, our financial expectations take into account current market conditions, and we are not depending on or anticipating any great strengthening in the natural gas market. As a reminder, our expectations assume only the projects that we already have in our backlog. While we continue to be optimistic, the federal policy support for renewable development will be maintained at least to some degree beyond the expiration of the production tax credit at the end of the year, we are not counting on that. We hope to be able to add additional projects to our backlog in due course, but if we do not, we would expect to be in a position to return some cash to investors in 2014. Under any realistic scenario, we currently expect our portfolio mix to continue to shift toward a higher percentage of cash flow and earnings coming from regulated and long-term contracted assets.  On our last earnings call, we laid out for you a short list of critical success factors for 2012 and told you we were intensely focused on successful execution. That remains true today. At Florida Power & Light, our customer value proposition continues to be strong. Our major capital projects are on track, and we have taken the first necessary steps in seeking rate relief.  At Energy Resources, our first quarter execution was satisfactory, and we have made good progress with all our renewable projects. However, the environment for the non-contracted portions of the Energy Resources portfolio continues to be very difficult.  At Lone Star Transmission, our construction program is on track, and we are in the midst of our rate case in Texas. If we continue to execute successfully as we have in the first quarter, we believe we will be well positioned to deliver on our 2012 and 2014 expectations.  Before closing, I'd like to turn the call over to Lew for a few comments.  As you are all aware, last month, we announced a plan for transition of the senior leadership of the firm. Lew will be stepping down as CEO as of the middle of the year and assuming the role of Executive Chairman with an expected retirement at the end of 2013. Jim Robo, currently President and Chief Operating Officer, will become CEO as of the middle of this year. While the substance of the transition was widely anticipated, a few of you have expressed some degree of surprise at the timing, and Lew would like to explain the logic behind his decision. Lew?
Lewis Hay: Thanks, Moray, and good morning, everyone. I think it's more appropriately said that Moray would like for me to explain the logic behind my decision, as opposed to me wanting to explain it, but nonetheless, hopefully, this will be the last time I have to discuss this. I've long thought that the transition of the CEO role from one individual to the next is one of the critical events in the evolution of a company. I believe it should be a clear, thoughtful and measured progression, if that's at all possible. And mostly prompted by me, our Board has had numerous discussions over the years covering a range of various possibilities. In the end, however, I think it really should come down to 3 things: first, the right point in a company's development; second, the readiness of a successor; and third, a clear decision on the part of the incumbent.  For us, I believe this is the right time. Our company is in an excellent position. Jim is clearly ready for the CEO role, and for me, it's really time for me to move on to a new phase of my life.  From the outset of my tenure as CEO, I have consistently believed, as I think Jim and Moray, and many others can attest, that a decade or so is generally about the right length of tenure for a CEO. Over that period, there's time to have a real impact on a large organization, to move it in new directions and also to mold its culture and values.  I also believe that during that kind of a time frame, a person can remain fresh and vigorous and not default to the same set of ideas for a want of new ones. Now some leaders can remain fresh and creative for a much longer period, but we've all seen leaders who hang on too long. I'm determined not to be one of those. I'm proud of what our team has accomplished over the last 11 years. I had the good fortune to inherit from Jim Broadhead, a strong, capable organization, but that organization is today, much stronger, more diverse and more capable. I think you'll also agree that we've succeeded in our fundamental objective of creating value for our shareholders.  I have all the confidence in the world that our organization will continue to improve and create even more value for all of our stakeholders under Jim Robo's leadership. Now for the 1.5 years after I step down as CEO, I'm going to be committed to making sure this transition goes as smoothly as possible. I expect to continue to support and mentor Jim as he grows into his new role. I'm going to maintain a number of executive functions for the transition period in order to leverage Jim's growth and his time. Now beyond that, I have a number of personal goals that really can't be met on the schedule of a CEO. And I'm looking forward to having the time and the flexibility to pursue those interests, that frankly I have had to defer so far. But be assured, my heart will never stray far from the company and its people that I have had the privilege to lead over the past 11 years.  And now we'll turn the call over to the conference moderator for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Daniel Eggers with Crédit Suisse.
Dan Eggers - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Just on the hedge unwind on the MP [ph] business and kind of responding to the natural gas market, are you -- can you share a little more thoughts on what else you do and in the businesses as far as responding both the CapEx and investment strategies in a low gas state?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Maybe I should first just explain what the hedge closeout is, because it's a little different than the way some people approach this business. Typically, when we commit to a drilling program, we will hedge the expected output for several years, which reduces the overall risk profile of that project or set of projects. That also creates an option that's somewhat akin to selling forward against the power plants, but if gas prices decline significantly, you always have the option of reversing the hedge position and not drilling the wells, so not committing the capital, and that's what we've done in a few instances. So it depends on the specific economic -- perspective economics of a particular group of wells, and obviously what happens in the marketplace. So in terms of the overall implications of the lower gas environment for that business, clearly, it means that some opportunities become marginal or no longer worth pursuing. At this stage though, because of the very small scale on which we are participating in that business, we're still seeing plenty of attractive opportunities. And recall that a key motivation for us to undertake these activities is to have active participation and hence, visibility into the evolution of the gas market in a variety of different regions around the country. So we're still finding that we can meet that objective and do so with attractive expected profitability. But we will obviously continue to look at individual groups of wells, and if it makes sense to take the money from sweeping the hedges and saving the capital, then we will do so.
Dan Eggers - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: So I just take this as a little bit of a portfolio reallocation more than anything else?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Yes, I think that's a good way of characterizing it.
Dan Eggers - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay, and then on commercial demand at the utility, it was -- you were particularly good in the quarter on a year-on-year basis. Can you give a little more color on what you're seeing at the commercial customer class, which has typically been the laggard out of this recession?
Moray P. Dewhurst: It's, like everything else we're saying, seeing it's a little bit up and down, stronger in -- among small commercial customers. We've seen some drop-off among the large, medium and larger commercial customers. I can't say that there's any pattern that we've been able to observe there. It's sort of -- again, different regions around the state are progressing at different rates, but not a lot of color that I can really add. I mean, it's all coming back slowly and a little bit in fits and starts. But definitely, the last few months have been more encouraging.
Dan Eggers - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay, so one last one, just on the rate impact that you guys show on Slide 9. The total bill impact, is that effectively marking the entire fuel builds of the forward curve for gas right now? So gas prices that go up, that savings -- that rate of increase will go up a little bit? Or is there still some timing difference between the market and where you guys are inputting fuel in that assumption?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Well, there's always a little bit of a timing difference. But conceptually, you're correct. It's a little bit more complicated than saying that we're just marking it to the current forward curve because we've got the impact of the existing hedge program, how that rolls through. But directionally, if gas prices come down as they have since we made the formal filing, then we would expect to see a further reduction in the total bill impact. And if subsequently they were to go back up, we would expect to see a slight increase in the total bill impact. So conceptually, you're right.
Operator: And we'll go next to Steven Fleishman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Lew, first, congratulations, and I just remember when you first started 10 years ago, everyone was telling you to sell the wind business because it cost too much CapEx, and I'm happy you decided not to. Moving on to -- I'm sure you remember that.
Lewis Hay: Absolutely.
Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: But moving on to a couple questions. First, on the gross margin and EBITDA slides, Moray, it seems like particularly in '12, the numbers have come up pretty good. Could you maybe go through a little bit what's driving that? Is it mainly better Texas power pricing on the little bit that's open? Any other main drivers?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Okay. Thanks for asking the question, Steve. Actually, the principal driver of the change in the numbers on those 2 charts is what I would call a technical one in the way that we have presented the economics of the tax equity project. To be blunt, the way we had been doing it really was understating our equivalent gross margin and without sort of sitting down with a piece of paper and explaining the -- almost the debits and credits a little difficult to go further than that. But effectively, we have now recast these gross margin charts to be a little closer to the concept that we were trying to get at originally of equivalent gross margin for a wind project that had tax equity against it. So that's the principle reason that the numbers have changed. Substantive changes in the period, both for 2012 and 2013, were pretty minor, some small additional hedges. But because we're so hedged for those 2 years, these numbers don't move around a great deal. The hedging activity that we undertook and executed in this period was mostly related to '14, '15 and '16. So we took advantage of some of the strengthening in the Texas spot spreads in particular to reduce our exposure in some of the outyears. But not a lot changed in 2012 and '13.
Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And then I think, Moray, you had talked about potentially doing a convertible or other financings this year. Is there any update on financing plans?
Moray P. Dewhurst: We continue to expect to access the equity markets in one form or another, most likely in the form of an equity unit or units. Timing remains to be seen. It will get worked into our overall financing plan and obviously, will depend on specific market conditions. But it's definitely baked into our expectations for the year and beyond, and it just remains to be seen, when the right time to execute is.
Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay, and then just lastly, maybe you can give an update with some of the kind of economic issues in Spain. Any update of any issues we should be worried about there for your project?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Well, we continue to, obviously, to monitor closely what the new government is thinking about doing on the perspective of energy policy. It's a little difficult for us to tell exactly how that's going to come out. They have clearly been very sensitive to the fact that many parties, including international investors, have committed significant amounts of capital in the expectation of a certain regulatory and contractual and pricing environment, and they clearly don't want to go back on that. At the same time, they've got a number of, kind of conflicting pressures. They have still that commitment to meet their renewable portfolio obligations under Kyoto and its successors. But they also have to worry about retail rate pressure. So not a lot to say substantively about how that will all come out. We're optimistic that the economics of the project will be preserved, but obviously, there can be no guarantee on that.
Operator: We'll go next to Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.
Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: One or 2 questions on Energy Resources, just want to make sure I understand 1 or 2 items. When you guys think longer-term about the several gigawatts of combined-cycle capacity you still have at Energy Resources, do you view this as core of the business still? And are these -- meaning, do you need, especially of the Texas assets to help in terms of kind of the hedging or providing a backstop for your retail presence? That's kind of question one about the gas plans. Question 2 is, I'm a little surprised there's not a bigger uptick in expected output levels from these plants, both the Texas one and the ones in PGM [ph], just given kind of where gas and coal prices are, and the fact we've seen a lot of other folks with combined-cycle talk about witnessing a significant uptick in output going forward.
Moray P. Dewhurst: Okay. On the first question, it's sort of whether the -- how core the gas plants are. I guess the right way to think about that is we continue to like very much our portfolios in New England and Texas. They, respectively within those geographies, they kind of work well together, along with our other books of business in those regions. So I think those we still see as core. But I would say that nothing in our portfolio is absolute, and we will clearly respond to changes in the marketplace and if it makes sense for us to consider divesting assets, we will consider divesting assets. I think we've demonstrated that over the years. So we still like the pieces that we have, but that's in part a function of where markets are today, and where we expect them to be in the future. So it's not an absolute. Specifically, in terms of Texas, I think it's important to recognize that the gas plants are much more significant, just in terms of the impact to the portfolio than is the competitive retail business. On the second question, the -- I'm not quite sure where you're picking up what our expected output would be. If it's from the hedging slide, just recognize that, that's on a dollar basis, and so we have hedged a very significant portion of all those assets. In general, we would expect to see some advantage from what you're talking about, the market changes, flowing through what we call asset optimization. So generally, as those markets strengthen, prospectively, it would give us more opportunities for optimizing around the hedge positions that we've taken. Just as an add-on to that, I mean, this quarter because the weather was so mild and markets were relatively flat, provided very few opportunities for that kind of asset optimization. So I think that's more where we would see the benefit coming in the future.
Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And one other question. Just -- I want to make sure I have my arms around how much -- or if there's a way you can quantify what the delta between GAAP and cash taxes will likely be over the next couple of years.
Moray P. Dewhurst: The short answer is not off the top of my head. Let me think about that some, Michael, and I will follow up with you.
Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Got it, I would just -- you can kind of look at the deferred tax balances, the asset liability on the balance sheet and recognize this could be a significant source of cash for both Energy Resources and the parent, obviously depending what happens with bonus D&A. Just trying to get my arms -- trying to quantify that a little bit. Happy to follow up off-line.
Moray P. Dewhurst: Yes, okay, I see where you're going. Yes, at that level, based on current tax law, we would expect to again, be a cash taxpayer in 2014. And once we're back in that mode, then we start to draw down the deferred balances very rapidly. So you're absolutely right, in terms of the direction and the, sort of, the trend there. But that is also, as you point out, dependent on tax law. And the biggest single factor that has caused us to be -- not to be a cash taxpayer for several years, as well as many other people in the industry, is bonus depreciation. So if bonus gets extended at 100%, then that clearly just pushes out the time at which we put back to being a cash taxpayer. But I'll follow up with you off-line to talk about more of the details of that.
Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay, and last question, why -- from an accounting perspective, why leave the $0.06 at Energy Resources tied to the unwind of the hedges, why leave that in adjusted EPS?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Basically, because the position has been resolved so that the mark on those hedges that we would otherwise have kept in NQH against an unmarked asset is now sort of out in the open and clean. So one way to think about it is effectively, we have drawn forward in time earnings that we otherwise would have expected to have realized over time.
Operator: We'll go next to Brian Chin with Citi.
Brian Chin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Just a quick question on Seabrook. The year-over-year effect of $0.04, is that primarily driven by just simply lower hedged prices and energy sales prices per megawatt hour? Or is there more of a terawatt hour effect from running the plant at a lower capacity level?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Well, there's 2 effects. There is the hedge prices. There's a lower hedge price impact, but the bigger impact is just lower output from the plant.
Brian Chin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And should we assume that, that lower output level will persist until we get to the next outage in October of this year? Is that the right way to think about that?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Yes, exactly. We're constrained because of the limits on our ability to cool the parts of a generator to lower output, and that will be resolved once we get to the refueling outage in the fall.
Operator: We'll go next to Jay Dobson with Wunderlich Securities.
James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division: Moray, would love to also talk about the upstream gas. Can you talk about the other side of the equation, which is, what is the current investment in that upstream gas business, and sort of, what prevents you from having to write down some of those investments, sort of while you're realizing the benefit in the hedges from the lower gas prices? And then a tag onto that, just sort of, now with the look forward, where we are in gas prices, sort of, what's your commitment to the upstream gas business?
Moray P. Dewhurst: In terms of the answer to the first, about $600 million is -- has been invested in the business. On the second part of your question, let me make sure that -- I may not have been clear. This is basically closing out hedges against wells that we don't intend to commit capital to. So there's no investment against them. We entered into the hedges against expected output. And now we're not going to pursue them, so we simply close out the hedge, which is in the money. I mean, effectively, you've got an option when you do that. If prices move up or down a little bit, you go ahead with the drilling program and you have your expected margin on the wells. If prices drop significantly at some point, they drop enough that it becomes -- and the money value of the hedges exceeds the margin that you expect to make on the wells. In which case, you don't drill the wells and you just close out the hedges. So that's what we've done in a few instances. So as we were discussing earlier, I think with Dan, it's -- the way to think about that is it's a capital reallocation opportunity. It means the future capital that we thought would go into one set of wells is now potentially available to go into other sets of wells, so that the result is not any issue of impairment. Wells that we have committed to, obviously will be subject to the standard accounting impairment test. But that's really not an issue right now. And then in the course of answering the first 2 parts, I lost track of your third part of your question.
James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division: No, no, absolutely, and I fully understood the accounting here. What I'm trying to get at -- and maybe the best way is the last question, which is you're realizing benefits from closing out hedges in wells you decided not to drill, but it obviously says something about the future prospects of that business, if nothing else, on the wells you've decided not to drill. Talk a little bit about sort of your commitment to that business on an ongoing basis.
Moray P. Dewhurst: Okay. I see where you're going. Yes, I think certain parts of the -- but obviously the weaker, lower expected output dry gas plays are a lot less attractive in a low gas environment. So you see capital moving away from those kinds of plays. At least what we're seeing is there are still plenty of good opportunities out there. But, I guess, I just go back to things that I've just spoken to many folks about over the last few weeks. In the end, natural gases market, like any other, are subject to both supply and demand effects. So as you see strong downward pressure on prices going forward, you're going to see both demand side reactions and supply side reactions. On the supply side, you're clearly going to see a combination of capital moving away from more marginal areas and concentrating on the most productive ones. You will, over time, see a reduction in the aggregate capital being deployed relative to what it would otherwise been. To me, it's just the normal workings of supply and demand. The critical questions are, what time frame -- over what time frame is that all going to work out? And I think what we have seen, really in the last year or so, is a general revision in market expectations that while there will be a reaction, both on the supply and the demand side, it's probably going to take longer than people were thinking a year or so ago. We would certainly concur with that. I would also underline that there are both short-term effects and longer-term effects. And the short term can be very quite different, obviously, because physical constraints on storage, you can get into situations as we've had this year where there's really no place for the gas to go, and that puts a very strong downward pressure on the front end of the curve. We still like a small participation in the business. And I just emphasized again that we have developed a tremendous amount of information value out of participating in this. It has significantly affected our hedging decisions over the last few years. And clearly, our participation there has been responsible for a lot of the in-the-money value that we now have in our existing power and gas hedges.
James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division: Great. On a sort of related question, I was hoping, Moray, you could talk a bit about Gexa and the Texas retail. Obviously a year ago, we were seeing the negative impacts of the Texas freeze and just sort of how that business performed in the first quarter.
Moray P. Dewhurst: Gexa had a good first quarter. I don't know that there's much special to report on there. Obviously, the interest is all focused on the summer months. I'm sure you've been following what's been happening to [indiscernible] Texas over the summer. We have made some changes to the way that we're approaching the management, the execution of the Texas portfolio, that should leave us in a better position for a tight summer. But I will also reemphasize what I've said before, which is a competitive supply business like Gexa is going to be hurt in extreme market conditions. So we look to offset that in the other parts of the portfolio.
James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division: No, that's perfect. And the last question, just sort of if you could give me an idea of the current status of your re-contracting efforts around Duane Arnold. Alliant has been somewhat vocal about sort of not going forward with the re-contracting when the contract expires in February of '14, and just sort of what you view as sort of your side of it and then what your alternatives are.
Moray P. Dewhurst: Sure. We are pursuing a number of different possibilities there. There are lots of customers in that part of the country, and we have had a number of discussions and expressions of interest. I think it's still early in that whole process. So clearly, the market is different from what it was when we entered into the original contract, and we understand that and we have that reflected in our expectations. But I'm confident that we will have an appropriate mix of re-contracting when the time comes.
James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division: Yes, to be doing similarly, you don't expect it to be with Alliant as the off-taker?
Moray P. Dewhurst: I'm not going to get into individual names.
Operator: We'll go next to Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Just wanted to touch base with you guys on the production tax credit versus the CITCs. Could you just tell us what they were for the quarter?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Yes. Bear with me one second while I find the right sheet. It was 450 megawatts that we expect to take this year, amounts to about $50 million of CITC over the course of the year. The first quarter was heavily loaded. It was about 20 of that because we have one project that went into service in the quarter. So I guess all of it's CITC then.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Okay, and then the production tax credit?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Well, PTCs would be on the remaining 850 megawatts or so. Whatever that amounts to, I haven't got the -- but recognize that most of those projects come in, in the third and fourth quarters, so they're not going to have a great deal of impact on 2012.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Okay, great. And then the O&M, I noticed it increased. Of course, your wind productions increased as well. Is that pretty much the reason why? Or is there anything else we should be thinking about?
Moray P. Dewhurst: No, there was only about $0.01 altogether from O&M and other operating --nothing significant there.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Okay, and then just finally on Seabrook, just to understand this, just a follow-up on Brian's question. There's -- the majority of the $0.04 is because of this cooling issue, which should be resolved in the fall. Is that correct? So we should basically be thinking of that not being an issue, I guess, in 2000 -- in the next year, correct?
Moray P. Dewhurst: I think it's about $0.02 or $0.03 of that.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: A quarter?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Of the $0.04, about $0.02 or $0.03 is associated with the down power.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Okay, so should see that over the next couple quarters, but then that will be gone going forward after the changes that are made?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Yes, I think that's roughly right. I'm trying -- I don't know. Depending on the shape of the pricing of the hedges, I don't know. But roughly that, yes. All right, just a follow up on that, I've just been passed a slipped a paper telling me that the total impact of the down power for the full year is about $25 million. Makes sense.
Operator: We'll go next to Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Just to clarify your comments about getting your 2014 aspiration regardless of what happens in Congress, can we imply that if Washington can get its act together and we do get a PTC extension, there's upside to that forecast?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Yes, absolutely. If -- we tried to present the expectations on this basis because there was certainly, at one time, a fair amount of confusion about what we had built into the numbers and what we didn't, so what's here is only the projects that we have in backlog. So to the extent that a policy support is continued in some form or another and we are able to translate that into additional projects that can get done in the '13, '14 time frame, that would clearly be upside. So just to repeat, we have no U.S. wind in the expectations at this stage beyond 2012.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: And since your forecast assumes no tax credit extension, do you have built into that forecast a share repurchase?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Certainly, in terms of the numbers that we put out there, how we get there is with the expectation of some share repurchase out in 2014. Again, I want emphasize that, that's by no means a commitment and it does depend, as we repeatedly said, on whether or not we're able to find additional good attractive investment opportunity. But if we are not, we would definitely be in a position to contemplate returning cash to shareholders in 2014.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: And what's your preferred method of returning cash? Is it -- would it be dividend or actually return of capital to share repurchase?
Moray P. Dewhurst: I think it would clearly depend on the circumstances at the time and I guess, 2 scenarios that I would throw out to think about, depending on how we saw the future going forward from 2014. To the extent that we saw the free cash flow positive balance as being sustained over a multi-year period, then I think, other things equal, we'd be more inclined to go the dividend route. To the extent that we saw it as a temporary phenomenon with the investment opportunities coming back a year or 2 later, I think we'd be more inclined to contemplate the repurchase route. But that's just kind of thinking out loud and obviously, it would depend on the actual facts and circumstances at the time. Fortunately, we have time to think about that, and obviously we a lot of work to do to get out to 2014.
Operator: We'll go next to Ashar Khan with Visium Asset Management.
Ashar Khan: Moray, can I just -- going to Slide 5, which shows the impact of regulated earnings on FPL year-over-year, and if I'm right, you mentioned the $0.07 came from the increase in rate base. And if one was to make the assumption because you mentioned you're going to be adding rate base for the year and 1/4 is in the first quarter and I guess, can we expect this $0.07 to repeat every quarter because of the spending going forward in the year?
Moray P. Dewhurst: I haven't looked at the exact profile of capital spending. So I could not say for sure that we're going to be at that level consistently. I fact, I kind of doubt we will be. I suspect this is a fairly intensive quarter of growth, just thinking about the overall growth in capital employed. So I wouldn't extrapolate from that.
Ashar Khan: Okay, and then just on the clause, was that clause just -- I guess, the nuclear upgrade expansion is an ongoing thing. Was the solar like -- isn't that also ongoing? Or is that again front-end loaded in the quarter?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Really the entire clause impact is coming from the -- material is coming from the nuclear operate.
Ashar Khan: Okay, so that expenditure, if I'm right, continues on the whole year.
Moray P. Dewhurst: Correct.
Operator: And we'll take our final question from Kamal Patel with Wells Fargo.
Kamal B. Patel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Most of my questions have been answered, so I'm going to go a default question. What has been the generic feedback on the Florida rate case filing? All the -- last time around, you tried to focus on the base rate aspects of it and deemphasize the fuel. Just wondering what the uptake has been sort of to date.
Moray P. Dewhurst: I don't know, but I could say it has been a lot of reaction. I think the basic elements of the rate case were understood when we made the test year [ph] letter in filings, so I'm not sure that there's been a great deal of a reaction so far. I think that, in addition, that the basic drivers of that need for rate relief are well-understood. So we're beginning to get into the process of discovery in which the interveners ask for all kinds of documents and all kinds of responses to questions, and I don't think there's anything out of the ordinary there.
Operator: And that concludes today's conference. We thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the NextEra Energy 2011 Fourth Quarter and Full-Year Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Rebecca Kujawa, Director of Investor Relations for NextEra Energy Inc. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Rebecca Kujawa: Thank you, Alicia. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter and full-year 2011 earnings conference call. Joining us this morning are Lew Hay, NextEra Energy's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Jim Robo, President, Chief Operating Officer of NextEra Energy; Moray Dewhurst, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; Armando Olivera, Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light Company; and Armando Pimentel, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources. Moray will be providing an overview of our results, following which, our senior management team will be available to take your questions.  We will be making statements during this call that are forward-looking. These statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements. If any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call in the Risk Factors section of the accompanying presentation or in the latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found at the Investor Relations section of our website at www.nexteraenergy.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. Please also note that today's presentation includes references to adjusted earnings, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying this presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of the non-GAAP measure to the closest GAAP financial measure. NextEra Energy's management uses adjusted earnings internally for financial planning, for analysis of the performance, for reporting of results to the Board of Directors and its input in determining whether certain performance targets are met for performance-based compensation under the company's employee incentive compensation plan.  NextEra Energy also uses earnings expressed in this fashion by communicating its earnings outlook to investors and analysts. NextEra Energy management believes that adjusted earnings provide a more meaningful representation of NextEra Energy's fundamental earnings power.  With that, I will turn the call over to Moray Dewhurst. Moray?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Thank you, Rebecca, and good morning, everyone. 2011 was a mixed year for NextEra Energy. We had a number of disappointments, but we also had at least an equal number of successes. On balance we must consider it a good year, as our successes position us well to deliver on our longer-term value proposition in spite of a very challenging environment for Energy Resources. We have the building blocks of our growth plan in place. Our focus now is on execution.  Let me first say a few words about the disappointments. Although our final adjusted results were well within the range of expectations we originally set out for you in October 2010, they were not what we had hoped for, yet a couple of caveats are in order. Despite the challenging environment for Energy Resources, we set another all-time high for adjusted earnings per share, and the growth in adjusted earnings per share of 2.1% was roughly in line with the median 10-year earnings per share growth rate for our industry, while our profitability is reflected in adjusted ROE, continues to be better than the long-term industry median.  But industry average performance is not what we expect of ourselves, and we know you do not expect it of us either. There were 4 principle reasons why we fell short of our expectations in 2011, all associated with Energy Resources. First, our proprietary trading activities fell well short of our hopes. In retrospect, we were overly optimistic about the market environment for these activities and hence, about the results they could achieve. We chose not to increase our risk profile in these areas, but instead, to accept what the market was giving us. Looking forward, we have adjusted our expectations downward for these parts of the business, reflecting our expectation that market conditions will continue to be soft for some time.  Second, we encountered some challenging issues at our Seabrook nuclear facility, which led to unplanned and extended outages and less availability than we had anticipated. Historically, our Energy Resources nuclear assets have run very well, and we expect to revert historical performance over time. Although we had challenges within the nuclear fleet in 2011, our nonnuclear-generating facilities performed exceptionally well with one of the lowest forced outage rates on record.  Third, we had hoped to get a few more megawatts of new renewable projects in the ground by the end of 2011. 2 projects will push into the first quarter of this year. This has relatively minor financial impact on the projects' overall economics as the projects are still expected to qualify for the relevant tax incentives.  Fourth, as we discussed extensively in the third quarter call, we were negatively impacted by the extreme heat in Texas in August. We were likely to see a negative impact on our retail customer supply business under such extreme adverse conditions even with the best execution. Nevertheless, we made a number of operational changes to improve our responsiveness and resilience should such extreme conditions occur again.  Although we were able partially to offset these 4 challenges in various ways, the net impact was that overall at the enterprise level, we were $0.10 or so short of where we expected to be.  2 external factors must also count as disappointments. As you all know, the forward curve for natural gas came down significantly. While the effects of those on our results are muted for the next several years by the heavily-hedged position at Energy Resources, over the long haul, lower natural gas prices mean lower power prices for our key merchant assets.  And finally, and quite separately, we were disappointed that the historically bipartisan issue of Federal support for renewables has, for the moment at least, apparently become one of the casualties of political conflict in Washington prior to a presidential election year. However, this issue is far from closed, and we remain optimistic that we will continue to see Federal support for renewables generally and wind specifically beyond 2012.  But while these developments were disappointing, we also had many successes in 2011. Chief among these was outstanding progress in the development of Energy Resources' renewable backlog. We continue to build our backlog of contracted renewable assets by entering into contracts for nearly 2,200 megawatts of wind and solar energy already placed in service in 2011 or expected to be placed in service by the end of 2016.  Project development, of course, is more than just executing contracts. Permitting and other approvals, construction execution and other challenges continue to be present on many projects even after a power purchase agreement is in place. But as a result of the excellent progress we have made in moving our development projects forward in 2011, we now have very high visibility into the evolution of our renewable portfolio for 2012 and beyond, and we know where we are likely to be by the end of 2012. We expect that by the end of this year, we will have nearly 10,000 megawatts of wind capacity in our fleet.  With the development success we've had this year, we believe that we're also very well-positioned to achieve our longer-term growth goals. Let me emphasize that while we are optimistic that Federal support for renewables will not be eliminated, as I mentioned earlier, the financial expectations that we have previously shared with you and that we are reaffirming today are based solely on projects in our backlog and do not depend upon an extension of the PTC program.  Turning now to Florida. FPL had a very strong year. Unit 3 at our West County Energy Center came into service on time and under budget, and as a result, our fossil system efficiency reached a new record.  Construction on the Cape Canaveral modernization made excellent progress, and that project is on schedule and on budget. Local officials and residents from Riviera Beach enjoyed witnessing firsthand the demolition of the old plant there, paving the way for another modernization. And we began to pursue a third modernization project, the Port Everglades, that is expected to save customers hundreds of millions of dollars over and above the cost of the plant. We expect a decision from the PSC regarding Port Everglades by the end of the second quarter. We believe that all these projects have significant direct benefits for our customers in the form of fuel savings, broader benefits for Floridians in form of job creation and lower emissions and long-term benefits in the form of lower electric bills.  Most important, at FPL, we continue to deliver what we firmly believe is the best customer value proposition in the state and one of the best anywhere in the country. Our customers enjoy our lowest bills in the state, bills that are 25% lower than the national average, top quartile reliability and award-winning customer service. For the eighth in a row, FPL received the prestigious ServiceOne award. This award is given to companies that exhibit exceptional customer service, and FPL is the only utility to have won at 8 consecutive times. Our emissions profile is among the best in the industry, and customers should see little impact from the recently-finalized EPA rules covering mercury, now known as the MACT rules.  Our strategy at FPL is straightforward. It is to see -- continuing to find ways in which we can economically improve our customer value proposition. In recent years, that is translated in large measure into deploying capital to substitute more efficiently for other parts of our cost structure. In particular, we have been spending heavily to make our generation fleet more efficient, which translates directly into fuel savings for our customers.  Since 2001, FPL system heat rate has improved by 19%, resulting in more than $5.5 billion in savings for customers, including more than $650 million in 2011 as a result of increased fuel efficiency. However, while the fuel decreases flow through regularly to our customers by the annual fuel clause proceedings, we must periodically seek recovery for the costs associated with the investments that create the efficiencies our customers enjoy.  For the years 2011 through 2013, we will invest an average of about $3 billion per year in generation and infrastructure projects that benefit our customers, including new clean, efficient power generation. And so in 2012, we will be filing a general base rate case, seeking new base rates to go into effect in 2013 after the conclusion of our current rate settlement agreement.  We filed a test year letter with the PSC on January 17, indicating our intent to seek rate release starting in 2013. While the details of the numbers may change somewhat as we prepare the required formal filing schedules, we anticipate that the total rate relief requested starting January 1, 2013 will be $525 million, with an additional $170 million at the time the Cape Canaveral modernization comes into service, reflecting the revenue requirements associated with that facility.  The key drivers of our request are simple. First, we need to address the impact of the accelerated amortization of so-called surplus depreciation ordered by the prior commission and implemented under the rate agreement. As we pointed out at the time, the accelerated amortization provided a short-term means of masking the need for rate relief at the expense of creating a larger incremental need in the future. Roughly half of our rate request is a direct reflection of the need to address the disappearance of surplus depreciation.  Second, we will seek rate recovery for Cape Canaveral. This modernization will improve system efficiency and reduce our overall fuel consumption, translating into benefits that our customers will see through fuel clause. We estimate that over the 30-year operational life of this plant, Cape Canaveral will produce net savings of approximately $600 million in fuel charges, over and above the $1 billion cost of building the plant.  Third, we expect to request that FPL's allowed retail regulatory ROE be reset to 11.25%, which is roughly the average of the allowed ROEs granted to the other Florida IOUs. We believe it is poor policy for the utility with the best customer value proposition in the state to have the lowest allowed ROE in the state and to rank in the bottom quartile of allowed ROEs in the nation, which is the current situation. We believe both common sense and sound policy suggest that providing the prospect of higher profitability to customers -- to companies that deliver higher value for their customers offers a strong incentive to improve performance.  Accordingly, included in our rate request is a 25-basis-point ROE add-on [ph], which we believe reflects FPL's current superior value proposition, but to be applied only if FPL maintains the lowest customer bill in the state.  In seeking rate release, we are mindful of the fact that there is never a good time for a rate increase, and our state and our customers are still doing with considerable economic uncertainty. Still, even with our requested base rate increase, which amounts to about $0.23 per day on the typical residential bill, we expect that our bills will remain the lowest in the state and about 10% lower than they were in 2006. So we will continue to offer a service that is extremely affordable and exceptionally valuable. Because of the improved efficiency of our system, as well as because of unrelated changes in other factors, including lower natural gas prices, we currently expect the total bill impact to be no more than $0.10 per day on the typical bill and potentially even less.  I should also note that the typical 1,000 kilowatt-hour bill, which is commonly used as a pricing reference point across the industry, is higher than our typical customer pays. Approximately 53% of our residential customers use less than 1,000 kilowatt hours a month on average.  The January 17 filing of the test year letter initiates a process that will likely occupy much of this year. We expect to make our formal filing with testimony and required detailed data late in the first quarter and expect that we will have hearings in the third quarter, with a final commission decision in the fourth quarter in time for new rates to go into effect January 1, 2013. As always, we are open to the possibility of resolving our rate request through a fair settlement agreement. However, we look forward to laying out our case and demonstrating how our proposed rates will help us continue to deliver strong reliability and lower bills for our customers. We are confident that a fair and objective review of our case will lead to a satisfactory outcome for customers and for shareholders.  Before turning to the details of our results, I would be remiss if I did not say a word or 2 about Armando Olivera, who will be retiring in May after 40 years of dedicated and successful service to our company. Armando has led FPL with extraordinary success since June 2003 and leaves the business one of the strongest and best-performing utilities anywhere in the nation.  In addition to managing business, however, Armando has always been concerned with developing the next generation of leaders, and we are confident that Eric Silagy, who is named President of FPL in December and who has worked closely with Armando for the last 4 years, will be ready for a seamless transition. We thank Armando for his service, we congratulate him on his great track record and we wish him well in the next phase of his life.  Let's now look at our results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2011. I'll start with the results at FPL before moving on to Energy Resources and then the consolidated numbers. For the full-year 2011, FPL reported net income of $1.1 billion or $2.55 per share, up $0.26 per share year-over-year.  Under the terms of the settlement agreement, FPL's earnings are largely a function of capital employed, equity ratio and allowed ROE. FPL's retail regulatory return on equity was largely unchanged in 2011 relative to 2010, and we increased our equity commitment to the business in line with the growth in capital employed. As a result, the primary driver of earnings growth is the 11.8% increase in average capital employed for the year, a consequence of our having invested over $3 billion to maintain and improve our electric system's reliability and efficiency. These investments collectively produce significant customer benefits in the form of lower fuel costs, better reliability and clean air. And they are key to our ability to keep our customers' electric bills the lowest in the state over the long haul.  For the full year, we recognized $187 million of surplus depreciation and amortization. For 2012, assuming normal weather and operating conditions, we expect to amortize between $510 million and $530 million of surplus depreciation.  During the fourth quarter, we had approximately 25,000 more customers than in the comparable period of 2010, representing an increase of 0.5%. This growth rate has been fairly consistent now for the last 6 quarters. Total retail sales declined 2.7%, driven primarily by relatively less favorable weather, which was partially offset by an increase in underlying usage and other.  As we've indicated before, underlying customer usage can be somewhat volatile on a quarterly basis, and we do not attach particular significance to this quarter's increase. For the full year, weather normalized sales were slightly positive, and underlying usage was roughly flat compared to 2010.  The economy in Florida continues to improve, though it remains weaker than we would all desire. In December, the unemployment rate in Florida dropped below 10% for the first time since April 2009. Perhaps more important, an annual increase of 113,000 jobs was reported for December. The first-time annual job growth has exceeded 100,000 jobs since early 2007.  As part of our commitment to job growth in the state and with the support of the PSC, FPL began offering in 2011 a new economic development rate to help attract more job creators to our state. This new rate provides eligible commercial and industrial businesses, with significant savings above and beyond an electric bill that is already the lowest in the state.  Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported fourth quarter 2011 GAAP earnings of $402 million or $0.96 per share. Adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter were $128 million or $0.30 per share. Adjusted earnings exclude the effect of the mark on non-qualifying hedges and net other than temporary impairments on certain investments or OTTI. The large difference between GAAP and adjusted results reflects the magnitude of the reduction in forward gas and power prices during the quarter.  For the full-year 2011, Energy Resources reported GAAP earnings of $774 million or $1.85 per share. Adjusted earnings were $679 million or $1.62 per share.  In addition to non-qualifying hedges and OTTI, for the full year, adjusted earnings exclude the net charges related to the sale of the 5 natural gas-fired generation assets.  Energy Resources' fourth quarter adjusted EPS decreased $0.04 from last year's comparable quarter. The only noteworthy negative driver was $0.05 related to Seabrook's unplanned outage. Please see the table in the appendix for additional details on the fourth quarter results.  For the full-year 2011, the $0.31 decline in adjusted EPS was driven by several factors. Contributions from our new investments declined $0.06, primarily due to the lower CITC elections in 2011 relative to 2010. We elected CITCs for roughly 275 megawatts of wind projects in 2011 compared to approximately 600 megawatts in 2010.  In our existing assets, our wind fleet contributed $0.23, primarily as a result of the greater wind resource. Seabrook's contribution declined by $0.12 as a result of lower hedge prices and an additional $0.11 due to extended and unplanned outages. Our gas infrastructure business contributed $0.06 more than the prior year. Our customer supply and proprietary trading businesses were down $0.22 year-over-year. And lastly, the other category declined $0.15 relative to 2010. This decline was largely the result of the asset impairment charges recognized in the second quarter of 2011, as well as higher interest expense due to growth in the business.  While we typically review our earnings drivers relative to the prior year, as I have just done, we thought it might be helpful also to give you a quick overview of what drove the difference between the expectations we shared with you prior to the beginning of the year and the results the businesses actually generated. We have included a summary in the appendix to this presentation that compares our realized equivalent EBITDA to the initial 2011 EBITDA ranges we provided in our third quarter 2010 earnings materials for the various components of Energy Resources business. You will see that with few exceptions our expectations were fairly close.  We have also included our updated hedging disclosures for 2012 and 2013 in the appendix. There were no significant changes for the last quarter. We remain highly hedged in both years.  Looking at the company on a consolidated basis, for the fourth quarter of 2011, NextEra Energy's GAAP net income was $667 million or $1.59 per share. NextEra Energy's 2011 fourth quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $395 million and $0.93, respectively.  For the full-year 2011, NextEra Energy's GAAP net income was $1.9 billion or $4.59 per share. NextEra Energy's adjusted 2011 earnings and EPS were $1.8 billion and $4.39, respectively.  Corporate and other's adjusted earnings increased primarily due to consolidated income tax adjustments related to state tax law changes and Federal tax benefits.  In 2011, the wind portfolio accounted for very roughly 40% of Energy Resources' adjusted earnings. Because of its importance, we recognized that many of you are interested in additional detail around this business. It was an excellent year for the wind business overall. Every year for the last decade or more, we have set new records for total production as the fleet has grown, and 2011 was no exception. In total, our wind business in 2011 generated nearly 25 million megawatt hours. To put this in perspective, this production is comparable to the retail load of a typical good-sized utility, such as OGE Energy, Alliant Energy or Great Plains Energy.  In addition, the fleet set a new record for capacity factor, as the wind resource recovered from well below average levels in 2009 and 2010. Looking forward and assuming normal wind resource, we expect the average capacity factor to continue to increase slowly as mix continues to shift towards more modern, higher efficiency turbines. It may also be of interest to note that 2011's capacity factor was significantly higher than the average capacity factor for the nation's natural gas-fired capacity taken as a whole.  Of the roughly 25 million megawatt hours of production, approximately 70% was eligible for PTCs, the remainder representing output primarily from projects on which we elected to take the CITC or from projects that have passed their 10-year window of eligibility for PTCs.  Of the PTCs generated, approximately 29% were allocated to investors under the various differential membership structures we have entered into. Looking forward, we expect this fraction to increase as we completed transactions of this type on 483 megawatts of capacity in 2011. We will continue to look for additional economically attractive opportunities to enter into these kinds of structures, commonly known as tax equity.  2011 was also a successful year for the execution of our financing strategy. Overall, we invested roughly $6.5 billion of capital into our businesses, net of amounts received under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.  Our cash flow from operations was approximately $4 billion. At FPL, we maintained a consistent capital structure and issued $850 million of long-term debt, while committing approximately $1 billion of new equity to the business. Through Capital Holdings and its subsidiaries, including Energy Resources, we issued more than $700 million of project or limited recourse debt, net of retirements and amortization and a net of $260 million of corporate debt. We also received a little over $350 million from the sale of differential membership interest in certain wind projects.  As you know, in 2011, we also sold 5 natural gas-fired assets. The impact of these transactions on our GAAP cash flow statement adds a little complexity, so a few words about the impact on our financing activities is warranted. In total, we sold the 5 assets for a gross value of $1.36 billion, leaving us with proceeds of $840 million after the elimination of the associated project debt obligations, a portion of which was assumed by the purchaser and a portion of which was retired. Of this $840 million, conceptually, $465 million was used to retire debt, although this is not evident in the cash flow statements as we simply integrated this effect into our existing financing plans. The remaining $375 million was used to repurchase equity. The net effect of the gas asset sales on our overall capital structure and credit position was essentially neutral.  Looking forward, we expect to continue to employ a balanced financing plan to support our growth, while maintaining our balance sheet and credit strength. Because we are continuing to invest at a rate in excess of ongoing operating cash flows, we will continue to need to access the capital markets periodically. We expect to use the same broad mix of products, including additional limited recourse project debt and the sale of differential membership interests that we have used in the past. We also need to maintain a balance between incremental debt and equity and expect there will be a need to issue a modest amount of equity in order to support our growth plans for 2012 through 2014. Our strong balance sheet and credit position are important to our strategy, and we expect to maintain them.  As we decide upon specific transactions, however, we will do so with an eye on where we expect to be in 2014. As we have previously stated, if we were simply to complete the projects that we currently have in backlog and add nothing new, we would expect to flip to become free cash flow positive after dividends in 2014.  On the other hand, if we are successful in identifying additional new attractive growth opportunities in the interim, we will want to have the balance sheet strength to support them. Consequently, we currently expect that the bulk of incremental equity support will be in the form of equity units, a type of instrument that we have employed in the past which aligns well with the earnings profile of the projects it supports. If we do not add to the current backlog of projects, we expect that the 2014 share count will be slightly lower than it was in 2011.  Turning now to expectations for 2012 and beyond. In 2012, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share will be in the range of $4.35 to $4.65. There have been no significant changes to the supporting logic we discussed with you on the third quarter call. Looking beyond 2012, we continue to believe that our adjusted EPS will grow at an average rate of 5% to 7% per year through 2014, which translates to a range of $5.05 to $5.65 in adjusted earnings per share in 2014, subject to all the usual caveats we provide, including normal weather and operating conditions. Again, the logic has not changed since our third quarter call, although the excellent progress we have made in the development of Energy Resources' backlog of renewal projects is encouraging.  In thinking about the growth of NextEra Energy, it is important to recognize the changing nature of our portfolio. The implementation of our strategies for both FPL and Energy Resources, coupled with the changing nature of the external environment, are leading us to a mix that is more heavily oriented towards regulated and long-term contracted assets than in the past. We're in the midst of the largest capital investment program in our history at FPL, which is causing this business to become a larger portion of our portfolio than it has in the recent past. At the same time, the externally-driven reduction in the opportunities available for the merchant elements of Energy Resources portfolio, coupled with our strategy of adding to the portfolio through long-term contracted assets, means that the proportion of Energy Resources portfolio exposed to commodity market volatility is decreasing. The net result is that with our present plans, we expect the proportion of our adjusted earnings coming from rate-regulated businesses, that is Florida Power & Light and Lone Star Transmission, to increase from 58% in 2011 to about 65% in 2014.  Similarly, we expect the proportion of our adjusted EBITDA coming from regulated businesses and long-term contracted assets to increase from 78% in 2011 to about 84% in 2014. In both cases, this would result in an overall mix comparable to the mix we had back in 2006 when Energy Resources was simply a much smaller business.  Before opening the phones to your questions, let me simply summarize what all these means for our 2012 priorities. Our focus is on execution across all our businesses. At Florida Power & Light, we must continue to deliver the best value proposition in the state, we must manage the execution of all our major capital projects successfully and we must achieve a satisfactory outcome to the base rate case.  At Energy Resources, we must have outstanding day-to-day execution across all elements of our broad and diverse portfolio of activities, and we must remain on track for the development of our record renewables backlog, including reaching commercial operations on roughly 1,150 to 1,500 megawatts of U.S. wind projects before the end of the year.  And at Lone Star transmission, we must continue our construction program to achieve commercial operations by the end of the first quarter in 2013, and we must achieve a satisfactory outcome of the general rate case.  Of course, these are not our only objectives, but they are the most important immediate ones. If we execute successfully, we will be well-positioned to deliver on our 2014 expectations.  And with that, I will turn the call over to the conference moderator for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Daniel Eggers from Crédit Suisse.
Dan Eggers - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: I guess first question, with Progress getting the settlement so early in their process, do you guys see an opportunity this time to settle? And maybe share your thoughts on any mechanisms you'd like to get back in place like the GBRA as you file a rate case or put it formal.
Moray P. Dewhurst: Progress' situation is obviously different from our -- I just don't think we're in a position to comment or speculate.
Dan Eggers - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And then I guess just on the renewable backlog. You guys in the past periods have given kind of a numerical amount of the projects you have in backlog that wasn't in the slides today. Has that changed or is there an update that you could share on that front?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Well, we're still within -- if you're referring to how it maps to the 1,400 to 2,000 over the 2-year period, we're still well within that range for the wind side. I think the pieces are here. If we haven't made them clear, I'll be happy to follow-up and make sure they are clear. On the last slide, I think it's pretty clear what we're working on right now.
Operator: We'll go next to Steve Fleishman from Bank of America.
Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Could you maybe go through some of the key growth projects and just development milestone updates and just what you'll be watching in terms of any issues there, maybe Spain, Genesis, the big ones?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Yes, let me ask Armando. I should specify Armando Pimentel since we are a company with 2 Armandos, managing its principal businesses. Armando Pimentel, would you like to comment?
Armando Pimentel: Steve, brief update. Spain project is going well. We are on track to bring those units, 2 different units, 2 50-megawatt units on track to bring 1 unit in -- earlier in 2013, the second one later in 2013. I'm very happy with the progress that's being made there. The Genesis project, our 250-megawatt project out in California, we're in the midst of construction. We are on schedule to bring unit 1 in, in the latter half of 2013. And the second unit, unit 2, each 125 megawatts, in 2014. Desert Sunlight, which, as you know, is being constructed by First Solar. It's a project that we bought 50% of, and GE Capital bought the other 50%. That's also on schedule, that has not changed. Some of that project will start hitting earnings, regular earnings and convertible investment tax credit earnings in '13. The bulk of that will be in '14, I believe, and then you have some in '15. And on the wind projects, we've got quite a bit that we want to get done this year. And I feel pretty comfortable at this point that virtually all of them are on schedule to get done because we've got potentially a real cliff, a PTC cliff at the end of the year. So obviously, we're very focused on that.
Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. Just one other question. Moray, your comments on -- thoughts on potentially some equity funding. Could you just kind of maybe better clarify what you're trying to say? Are you trying to say that it's only needed to the degree that there's more projects added to the portfolio beyond what's in the plan or you still need to do a little bit based on the current portfolio?
Moray P. Dewhurst: The latter is the case. I mean, if you sort of ask what it's going to be and when it's going to be, the answer is, it depends. And let me try to explain why. In the prepared remarks, I tried to say that we have to focus a little bit on where we're going to be in 2014. So if we project out to 2014 and assume for the moment that we only execute the projects that are in backlog, then we would find ourselves in a situation where, effectively, the level of equity that we have in the business today would be adequate. But there is an interim period to be got through. And so for that interim period, we will most likely need some modest level of incremental support. And hence, that's why we're thinking of doing it primarily in the form of equity units, which obviously I don't have a dilutive impact in the interim. And then depending upon where we are in 2014, we'll be able to decide how to adjust. Does that make it clearer?
Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: That's great.
Operator: We'll go next to Jay Dobson from Wunderlich Securities.
James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division: I was hoping you'd give a little more clarity on this corporate and other, which was as large as it was in the quarter and for the year. Just what was going on there and sort of how we should think about that going forward into '12 and I guess through '14? Although maybe that may be a little less clear in your crystal ball.
Moray P. Dewhurst: Yes, the sort of large size in the corporate and other is really -- is driven by tax issues. They are kind of a couple of buckets. In the second quarter we talked about the impact of some tax law changes. And in the fourth quarter, it gets a little complicated, but it's essentially the elimination of a deferred tax liability, which really came about as an outflow of more general settlement of broader issues with the IRS. But in both cases, what we're really talking about is an income effect from the elimination of the deferred tax liability. So from an income statement perspective, they're kind of one-time effects, so they won't roll over into subsequent years. From a cash flow perspective, they are genuinely the improvement of a future cash flow position.
James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division: Okay, got you. So if we're looking out to -- I don't want to get too detailed into guidance around this, but for '12, we ought to be going back to corporate and other in the, I don't know, $0.08 just to use what you reported last year?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Yes, I mean, don't quote me -- quote me on the specific number, but the large magnitude that we've seen this year in corporate and other, we would not expect to recur.
James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division: Okay, fair enough. And then I missed the number. How much surplus depreciation did you book in '11?
Moray P. Dewhurst: $187 million.
James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division: $187 million. And so even with the use of roughly $520 million, I think, you said for this year, you'd have some of that leftover. Is it your anticipation under your filing that you would -- you have the ability to use that in future years?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Yes. Right now, the way we look at the numbers, we would have roughly $190 million leftover at the end of the year. And so we're thinking that, that would be the amount that will go in to the filing.
James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division: Okay, great. And then just a detailed question. I know you left this out of the adjusted earnings, but what was the loss you recorded for the RISEC sale, the Rhode Island plant?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Solely for the RISEC?
James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division: Yes, just solely for that one, because the other one occurred in the third quarter.
Moray P. Dewhurst: Okay. For RISEC, it was immaterial. The accounting, the book loss was primarily associated with the other 4.
James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division: Okay. So you guys just said less than $0.01 it was, in fact?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Yes, less than $0.01.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll go next to Paul Patterson from Glenrock Associates.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Congratulations to Armando in terms of his retirement. And I just want to touch basically on the long-term growth rate. We have seen a decrease in gas prices. Do you still feel that you can make that growth rate with today's low gas prices because of the hedging and other activity that you're doing? Or is it based on different gas price outlook?
Moray P. Dewhurst: No, we haven't changed in any way the way that we approach sharing with you our expectation. So they always incorporate our view of the current forward. So as you would imagine, we can continue to get there because we have heavily hedged the portfolio. So we continue to feel very good about where we are through the 2014 timeframe.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Okay. That's what I thought. And then just in terms of wind, there was a Fitch downgrade on a specific project, I think about a 500-megawatt project associated with higher O&M than have been projected and lower revenues. And I was just wondering, is that something specific with that project? Is there anything that we should be thinking about? I know that you guys haven't really changed much in terms of your own wind outlook in the slides, but I'm just wondering if you could just give us a little bit more of a flavor in terms of how the wind portfolio is working and just what that was all about.
Moray P. Dewhurst: Yes, sure. Let me first speak to the particular -- it's actually a collection of projects. The downgrade occurred on project debt of a portfolio of projects, one of the early portfolio limited recourse financings that we did back in, I want to say, the '05 timeframe, somewhere around there, maybe earlier. So this is -- Fitch is taking action on the project debt there. Actually behind Moody's and S&P, they have previously reevaluated it. The key drivers there are actually -- the low wind resource that we had in 2009 and 2010 was stressing the coverage ratios of both the portfolio. And in addition, it is true that we've had higher O&M experience. They were some of the earlier turbines that had a higher incidence of gearbox failure than we now see. So I don't attribute anything specific -- or anything, excuse me, anything more general from that particular issue. And I think actually given that the wind resource came back very nicely in 2011, the coverage ratios on those -- on the project debt came back up just fine. I don't see that there's a problem there. But in addition, I certainly don't see that as being anything that we need to think about extrapolating through the rest of the fleet. So the rest of the fleet is running very well and project-specific issues there.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Okay. And then just finally on the renewal of the tax credit for 2012, how should we think about that? I mean, I guess you mentioned in your opening remarks about the political activity in Washington. Any sense as to when you expect that to be renewed or how we should be monitoring that or I don't know, it seems to be sort of -- Washington is hard to monitor, I guess. But what are your thoughts on that?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Yes, well, I think the first thing to be said is it's a constantly changing situation. But Lew has spent a fair amount of time in D.C. over the past month, so I think he would like to offer a few thoughts on that.
Lewis Hay: Yes. I'm not sure I can add too much to it, but if I was capable of predicting what was going on in D.C., I would probably be doing something else because I think there's a way to make some money on that. But historically, the PTC has had bipartisan support. We're in a highly politicized period, and clearly, the growing debt load the country has is an issue. So it is hard to say how it stacks up. We've been spending a lot of time in D.C., communicating the virtues of the PTC, and I think we're making some progress, making a lot of progress. And I think you all heard the President the other night recommit his support for clean energy. So it's still hard to say how this is going to sort itself out. We're, I'd say, cautiously optimistic that there's -- that some things can be done. It's probably going to be a rocky road. There's several different points in time over the year that something can happen, hard to predict when anything really will happen. But one thing I'm still very comfortable with is, long-term, there's going to be some form of support for renewable and clean energy. So I can say, stay tuned.
Moray P. Dewhurst: Yes. And just to close that out, let me -- I'll just add, in practical terms, what it means is that we are planning on the assumption that it expires at the end of 2012, but we are preparing ourselves for a variety of other possibilities.
Operator: We'll go next to Raymond Leung from Goldman Sachs.
Raymond M. Leung - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Question about financing needs. Can you talk a little bit about, under your current plan, what do you expect in terms of debt financing out of the utility and potentially capital resources? And even if you could provide us some ranges or parameters to help us out.
Moray P. Dewhurst: At this stage, I'm really not prepared to get into sort of specific numbers and timing. All I can tell you is that Florida Power & Light, we feel that continue to be in the midst of this very heavy spending phase. We will maintain the capital -- balanced capital structure. So that means that there will be periodic first mortgage bond issuance as the primary vehicle that we use there. On the Capital Holdings side, again, it gets a little more complicated there because we have a wider variety of instruments that we use. As I tried to indicate in the prepared remarks, we will likely be drawing on all of them, but we're still sort of fine-tuning the plan for this year. So as I said, I'm not prepared to come out with specific numbers at this stage.
Raymond M. Leung - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. Can you maybe help provide us with like financial targets or metric targets and like a cash flow debt on capital side or to help us at least guide us?
Moray P. Dewhurst: I can't right now, but I will certainly -- I have committed to others that we will provide better guidance than we have in the past on that issue. And the reason it gets a little complicated is because there's no one single metric that we use. So we look at a variety of different coverage ratios effectively. And we look at them in a variety of different ways, and we try and optimize the overall plan. So it's difficult for me to give you a specific target. But having said that, I can do a better job than I have in the past of narrowing down the range. I'm committed to doing that.
Raymond M. Leung - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And just last question. In terms of -- I see you have a fairly large backlog, but can you talk a little bit about how you're thinking in terms of what you're seeing in terms of acquisition opportunities in the renewable side? There's been a lot more transactions there, some projects that I think have maybe come under some pressure. And maybe how you're thinking about that relative to your own organic backlog.
Moray P. Dewhurst: Sure. Certainly, there have been some projects and some transactions, frankly, not as many as we would have expected or hoped. We continue to be very optimistic that as some of the political uncertainties that Lew was talking about resolve themselves one way or the other, some folks will be making decisions about assets that they now hold. So we're very optimistic that there will be additional opportunities in that area, but there's nothing specific obviously that I can address at the moment. I would just reemphasize that acquisitions, asset acquisitions are not baked into the numbers that we have shared with you. So anything that we did in that way would have to be considered incremental to what we've shared with you.
Operator: We'll go next to Paul Ridzon from KeyBanc.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: What was the impact of weather in the quarter and year? And in the past, you gave us sensitivity to wind resource in cents per share, and I remember that correlation kind of blew up. Is there any tool we can use along those lines?
Moray P. Dewhurst: On the latter part, I believe the wind sensitivity is in the back, on Slide 23. So 1% change in the wind resource is about $0.02 or $0.03 per share. On the final weather effect for Florida Power & Light, we're trying to get the numbers.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: [indiscernible] next question and come back to that?
Moray P. Dewhurst: No. But just recognized that under the settlement agreement, weather doesn't have a direct impact on earnings because it's typically offset by an adjustment to the surplus amortization. So we're happy to get you the number.
Operator: We'll go next to Ashar Khan [ph] from Visium Asset Management.
Unknown Analyst: Moray, if I go to Slide 16 that you provided, and if I'm right, I did my FPL, the utility divided by the parent, I come to the exact 58%. Can I use that same thing for 2014, using some kind of a midpoint as to what that 65% would be FPL and the transmission company or just FPL alone, the way you have shown it on this slide?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Yes. Let me be clear what's in the slide. In the last part of the slide, so the percent from adjusted earnings from regulated businesses, that's the sum of FPL and Lone Star Transmission. So Lone Star is immaterial in 2011, but by 2014, we expect will be up and running. So conceptually, what you're talking about is the right way to think of it, but you're going to have the 2 pieces in. The chart -- the part of the -- the right-hand side of the chart, the EBITDA part, includes the whole enterprise, and so includes all of Energy Resources' components and factors in how much of Energy Resources' mix is associated with long-term contracted projects versus everything else. So in the right, in the green part of the bar, you've got FPL, plus Lone Star Transmission, plus the long-term contracted projects within Energy Resources.
Unknown Analyst: Okay. So if I do my math, Moray, it seems like as what you've been telling right that from 2011 to '14, right, if I take the midpoint, it's like a $0.97 increase. It seems like $0.92 is coming from the regulated business. That means like nearly like 95% of the growth is just coming from the regulated side to meet some kind of a midpoint of the range.
Moray P. Dewhurst: Well, I can't frankly follow your specific arithmetic right here now, but it is certainly true that the bulk of the growth that we're anticipating over this period is going to be associated with Florida Power & Light.
Operator: We'll go next to Jay Dobson from Wunderlich Securities.
James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division: Moray, sorry to come back in the queue, but just a quick question. Gas infrastructure, I don't remember what you sort of targeted there. I know it's relatively small numbers. But how does the current gas environment affect your outlook on investments there?
Moray P. Dewhurst: I think relative to a higher gas environment, other things equal, it means it will be, in the future, fewer opportunities. Having said that, at this stage, there are still plenty of deals that we're seeing that seem pretty attractive. We have indicated that we're going to limit the capital commitment to that business. But as to what the market opportunities will be, we'll have to see. Obviously, I'm sure many of you have seen others indicating that they may be moving assets away from gas explorations. So I think we're just going to have to see how that plays out. But clearly, over the long haul, our lower gas environment makes it less attractive for that business.
James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division: And remind me what the -- not commitment, but at least what you target to put to work there. Is that sort of $30 million to $50 million a year?
Moray P. Dewhurst: We had talked about a level of total capital commitment of up to maybe $600 million.
James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division: Over a period of several years?
Moray P. Dewhurst: Yes, sure, over a period of several years, I think out through 2012, toward 2014. 2014.
James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division: Okay, got you. Got you. So more like $200 million a year.
Operator: At this time, we have no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to our speakers for any additional or closing comments.
Rebecca Kujawa: Thank you, everyone, very much for joining us today. We look forward to catching up with you again soon.
Operator: That does conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to this NextEra 2011 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Rebecca Kujawa, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Rebecca Kujawa: Thank you, Bill. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our Third Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. Lew Hay, NextEra Energy's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of NextEra Energy's performance and recent accomplishments. Lew will be followed by Armando Pimentel, our former Chief Financial Officer and current President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources LLC, which we will refer to with its subsidiaries as Energy Resources in this presentation. Armando will discuss the specifics of our financial results. Also joining us this morning are Moray Dewhurst, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; Jim Robo, President and Chief Operating Officer of NextEra Energy; and Armando Olivera, President and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light. Following our prepared remarks, our senior management team will be available to take your questions. We will be making statements during this call that are forward-looking. These statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements. If any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call in the Risk Factors section of the accompanying presentation or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website, www.nexteraenergy.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. Please also note that today's presentation includes references to adjusted earnings, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying this presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of the non-GAAP measure to the closest GAAP financial measure. With that, I will turn the call over to Lew Hay. Lew?
Lewis Hay: Okay. Thank you, Rebecca, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that FPL had strong performance in the third quarter and while Energy Resources had a challenging quarter financially, the team executed well on creating tangible growth opportunities for the future. During the quarter, we continued to build a large backlog of future investment opportunities at both of our main businesses. Despite the decline in year-over-year financial results at Energy Resources, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share for 2011 to be at the low end of our range of $4.35 to $4.65.  At Florida Power & Light Company, earnings per share were up approximately 12% over the prior year comparable quarter due to increased investment in the business. The Florida economy continues to show mixed signs with improvement in some indicators and little change in others. Florida's unemployment rate was 10.6% as of September 2011. This is 1.1 percentage points below last year's comparable month, and represents one of the largest year-over-year decreases in state unemployment rates in the United States. Florida's housing affordability has improved significantly, particularly in FPL's core markets. The Case-Shiller index, which tracks the prices of residential real estate has fallen 50% from its 2006 peak for the Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach County markets in South Florida. This makes Florida much more attractive to baby boomers as they enter retirement, and the state's existing home sales trend continue to show positive momentum.  Over the quarter, FPL averaged 24,000 more customers than we had in the year-ago comparable quarter, and our inactive meters have declined 4.4% since the year-ago period. Florida also continues to have a low tax burden, and we are encouraged by the efforts of Governor Scott's administration to make the state even more attractive to businesses.  At FPL, we continue to make good progress on our large investment program. Our nuclear uprate work at St. Lucie and Turkey Point continues. Last week, the Florida Public Service Commission approved FPL's nuclear cost recovery of $196 million through the capacity clause. This amount relates primarily to the cost of nuclear uprates, which by themselves are estimated to provide fuel savings to customers of $4.6 billion to $4.8 million over the lives of the plants. The commission determined that FPL's 2009 and 2010 uprate costs were prudently incurred, and FPL's actual and projected 2011 and 2012 costs are reasonable. Cost recovery for 2009 and 2010 was one of several issues that had been left unresolved by the prior commission. All of the prior unresolved issues have now been resolved. This week, the commission approved the remainder of the clauses for 2012 including fuel conservation and environmental clauses. This approval was reached through stipulation with all parties.  During the third quarter, the commission accepted FPL's request for a bid rule exemption regarding the proposed modernization of the Port Everglades facility. And we plan to file a petition for a determination of need for the facility later this month. If the new plant were to come online in 2016 as currently proposed, the Port Everglade's modernization would cost roughly $1.2 billion and is expected to provide net customer benefits of more than $400 million over the life of the plant.  In aggregate, FPL's completed and planned investments from 2001 to 2016 are expected to save customers an estimated $1.3 billion in projected fuel costs in 2016 relative to a 2001 baseline. These investments are delivering significant benefits to our customers through operating efficiencies, cleaner generation and reduced fuel costs. As a result, FPL customers are receiving cleaner, more reliable energy for a typical bill that is the lowest in Florida and more than 20% below the national average. Looking forward, we expect that these investments will allow us to keep our typical residential customer bill among the lowest in the state.  On the Energy Resources side of the business, we made great strides in growing our backlog of contracted renewable energy projects by entering into contracts for approximately 1,100 megawatts of new renewable energy capacity since our second quarter earnings call. In fact, since the beginning of the year, we have signed approximately 2,100 megawatts of contracts per new wind and solar projects. Now the numbers I just gave you are slightly higher than what are shown on the slides as last night, we entered into a new 100-megawatt wind contract, which is not included in the numbers you're seeing on the slides. This year is the most successful contracting the year in Energy Resources' history.  On the solar development front, we were pleased to announce that we have purchased a 50% ownership interest in the 550-megawatt Desert Sunlight photovoltaic solar project. We believe the addition of Desert Sunlight, which is expected to be one of the world's largest solar PV facilities considerably strengthens our backlog of solar projects. We expect this project will begin operation in 2013 and be at full capacity in 2015. Long-term power purchase agreements or PPAs for the project have already been approved by the California Public Utilities Commission.  I also want to take this opportunity to announce that we are pursuing the necessary approvals and permits to develop the McCoy solar facility, a 250-megawatt solar PV project located in the Mojave Desert near the Genesis and Desert Sunlight projects. This project, which is expected to reach full commercial operations by 2016 has a long-term contract with Southern California Edison, currently pending approval by the California Public Utilities Commission. This project further enhances the visibility of our longer-term backlog, and we look forward to providing you additional updates on McCoy in the future. McCoy and Desert Sunlight join our solar portfolio alongside our Genesis and Spain solar thermal projects and several other smaller PV projects, increasing our backlog of already contracted solar opportunities to 940 megawatts expected to come into service sometime between 2011 and 2016. We expect these projects will begin contributing meaningfully to cash flow and earnings in 2013.  On the wind development front, we had another active quarter and now have long-term PPAs for over 1,400 megawatts of new wind projects to be commissioned in 2011 and 2012, including the contract we signed last night. By 2012, Energy Resources expects to have approximately 10,000 megawatts of operating wind projects that provide on their own attractive upside opportunities. Looking beyond 2012, our current backlog of already contracted wind projects for 2013 and 2014 is 593 megawatts, which includes 469 megawatts of Canadian projects that we talked about last quarter, as well as an additional Canadian project of 124 megawatts that we had previously included in our 2012 backlog but now expect to come online in 2013.  As you know, last month we announced new management roles for Armando Pimentel and Moray Dewhurst. Since Armando was Chief Financial Officer during the third quarter, he will be presenting the company's quarterly financial results today. With that, I will turn the call over to Armando before returning for some closing comments. Armando?
Armando Pimentel: Thank you, Lew, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter of 2011, NextEra Energy's GAAP net income was $407 million or $0.97 per share. NextEra Energy's 2011 third quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $551 million and $1.31 per share, respectively. The difference between the GAAP and adjusted results is the exclusion of the mark in our non-qualifying hedge category, the exclusion of net other than temporary impairments on certain investments or OTTI, and exclusion of the impact of the pending sale of Energy Resources' ownership interest in a portfolio for natural gas-fired generation assets. The pending sale of these assets resulted in a onetime after-tax charge of approximately $0.23 per share, of which approximately $0.22 was at Energy Resources and $0.01 was at corporate and other due to the consolidated tax impact. These results are still subject to various closing adjustments.  Late last month, we announced the sale of our ownership interest in RIEC, a 550-megawatt gas-fired generation asset. The transaction is expected to result in a onetime after-tax charge of less than $0.01 per share subject to final closing adjustments, which the company expects to exclude from fourth quarter and fiscal 2011 adjusted earnings.  For the third quarter of 2011, Florida Power & Light reported net income of $347 million or $0.83 per share. FPL's contribution to earnings per share increased $0.09 relative to the prior year's comparable quarter driven almost entirely by the substantial investments we have made in the business, including the nuclear uprates in our Martin solar facility. As a reminder, for the term of the 2010 base rate agreement, FPL's earnings will largely be a function of its rate base and return on equity cap. We continue to expect that FPL will realize a retail regulatory ROE at or near 11% during each of 2011 and 2012 subject to the normal caveats we provide, including weather and operating conditions. For the terms of the base rate agreement, we expect that FPL will be able to amortize surplus depreciation to offset most of the variability in its normal operations, including modest differences from normal weather. Keep in mind that because the return on equity is calculated each month on a trailing 12-month basis, you should expect to see continued variability in FPL's quarterly earnings. But on an annual basis, we expect that retail regulatory return to be approximately 11% in 2011 and 2012.  During the quarter, we reversed $47 million of surplus depreciation to maintain a regulatory ROE of 11% in accordance with the settlement agreement. Year-to-date, we have recognized approximately $84 million of surplus depreciation amortization. For the full year 2011, assuming normal weather and operating conditions, we now expect to amortize between $160 million and $180 million, down from our previous range of $180 million to $200 million provided on our second quarter earnings call. This revision is largely a result of modestly favorable weather experienced in the third quarter. At this point, we expect to utilize between $510 million and $530 million of surplus depreciation in 2012, leaving us at the end of 2012 with between $180 million and $220 million remaining of the original $895 million established in the last rate case. Although, of course, the exact amount will depend upon a variety of other factors affecting 2012 results including the actual 2012 weather.  Some of FPL's key customer metrics continue to show mixed results. The table in the upper left shows the change in retail kilowatt-hour sales in the quarter versus last year's comparable period. Overall, on a comparable basis, retail kilowatt-hour sales decreased by 2.4% with the average number of customers increasing 0.5%. Although the usage due to weather is down slightly from last year, cooling degree days were 6.9% higher than normal. Non-weather related or underlying usage and all other declined by 1.1%. We continue to analyze customer usage statistics to assess how much of the decline can be attributed to the economic environment, and how much is the result of mandated efficiency standards. At this point, we believe each is contributing roughly equally to the decline. There is, however, more work for us to do in this important area. As depicted in the graph in the upper right corner, during the third quarter of 2011, we had approximately 24,000 more customers than we did in the comparable period of 2010. This is the seventh quarter in a row where we have had customer increases compared to the prior year comparable period. The graph on the bottom left of the page shows inactive and low usage customers, which we believe are indicative of the level of empty homes in our service territory. While the percentage of low usage customers is flat to last year, inactive accounts declined approximately 4.4% since the end of last year's third quarter. We also want to highlight a recent update from the Office of Economic and Demographic Research regarding its population growth outlook for Florida. The chart at the bottom right corner provides annual projected population growth in Florida through 2021. The chart shows population growth rates increasing from 0.6% in 2012 to a peak of 1.5% in 2016 before tapering off slightly. We believe this is a positive indication of long-term potential customer growth.  Turning to Florida's economic environment. A number of the indicators we follow have improved since the depth of the recession, but progress has been less consistent than we would prefer to see. Both the retail sales index and the tourism taxable sales are up over the comparable period in 2010. The trailing 12-month average of existing home sales continues to trend positively, suggesting the market is moving through the inventory of available homes. We continue to believe Florida offers a unique proposition in terms of housing affordability, great weather, low taxes and a pro-business economy. All of which should continue to lead to ongoing customer growth for FPL in the future.  Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported third quarter 2011 GAAP earnings of $67 million or $0.16 per share. Adjusted earnings for the third quarter, which exclude the effect of non-qualifying hedges, net OTTI and the previously announced loss in the 4 natural gas-fired generation assets held for sale, were $204 million or $0.49 per share.  Energy Resources' third quarter adjusted EPS decreased $0.15 from last year's comparable quarter. New wind and solar investment contributions decreased $0.06 relative to last year as a result of lower CITC elections and lower state tax credits. Our estimate for full-year 2011 CITC elections is unchanged at roughly 275 megawatts compared with approximately 600 megawatts for 2010 projects. We continue to expect the full-year impact of lower CITC elections in 2011 relative to 2010 to be approximately $0.07. In aggregate, the existing asset portfolio contribution was roughly flat relative to the prior year comparable quarter.  Wind resource in the quarter was 88% relative to normal compared to 99% relative to normal in the prior year comparable quarter. The weaker wind resource was the primary driver of the negative $0.04 contribution from existing wind assets relative to the prior year comparable quarter. Year-to-date, the wind resource has been at 98% of normal. The Texas gas-fired generation assets contributed $0.02 primarily as a result of extreme hot weather in the [indiscernible] region.  In the nuclear asset portfolio, Seabrook's contribution was lower by $0.03 as a result of lower price hedges while Point Beach contributed $0.05 more as a result of decommissioning fund gains, favorable generation and the lack of an outage in this quarter.  Our shale gas well-drilling program contributed an additional $0.05 compared to the prior year comparable quarter. Customer supply in proprietary trading were down $0.13. This includes lower earnings at Gexa, a retail business, of approximately $0.05 attributable to the extreme hot weather in Texas during the month of August, and lower contributions from our proprietary trading business of roughly $0.07.  As you know, there are 3 main parts to our Texas portfolio: two large-combined cycle plants, approximately 1,700 megawatts of hedged wind assets and a position in the competitive retail market through our Gexa subsidiary. Normally, we expect warm weather to be good for the gas assets, challenging for Gexa and uncertain for the wind assets. If the wind blows hard it is good, as we have excess capacity to sell. If the wind is weak, it is bad as we have to buy power to cover our hedges. Through most of the quarter, which experienced much warmer than usual weather, our experience was consistent with prior years. However, in August, when the Houston area experienced 22 days of record heat, the negative impact on Gexa increased more rapidly than the favorable impact on the gas plants, which were largely hedged and at the same time, the wind resource was light during the super peak period. As a result, the negatives out-weighed the positives and at the portfolio level, we were down $0.05.  After undertaking a thorough review, it is clear that we could have reacted more quickly to certain signs we were seeing in the marketplace and reduced this impact. We have made changes as a result, and we believe we are now better positioned to avoid a recurrence of this issue. Ironically, however, the same events that caused us pain in the current quarter helped in other ways as forward curves moved up sharply and we were able to hedge out additional volumes for future years at higher prices than we could have done before the heatwave.  From a development standpoint, we had a terrific quarter in terms of adding to our backlog of already contracted solar and wind opportunities, as Lew mentioned, just a couple of minutes ago. Starting with solar, since the second quarter, we have added 2 new projects: Desert Sunlight and McCoy. With the addition of these 2 projects, we now expect to be toward the high-end of the plans we laid out for investors at our May 2010 investor conference to invest between $3 billion and $4 billion in solar opportunities during the 2010 to 2014 timeframe. Including all of the planned solar projects that are already under long-term contract, Energy Resources plans to invest between $2.1 billion and $2.3 billion in 2011 and 2012, and between $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion in 2013 and 2014. We now plan to add roughly 660 megawatts of solar to the portfolio between 2011 and 2014, and plan for an additional roughly 280 megawatts to be brought into service between 2015 and 2016.  Turning to our wind business. Energy Resources' backlog of tangible investment opportunities includes plans to spend between $2.1 billion and $2.3 billion in 2011 and 2012, and $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion in 2013 and 2014. Included in these expectations are the 1,310 megawatts of signed PPAs for projects we plan to put in service in either 2011 or 2012. Our 2013 to 2014 backlog includes 593 megawatts Canadian wind projects. These numbers do not include the CapEx associated with the 100-megawatt contract we signed last night, which we expect to complete in 2012.  Since this is our first opportunity to talk to you regarding our 2 new large solar projects, we want to provide a short overview of each project. At the end of September, we acquired 50% ownership in the 550-megawatt Desert Sunlight solar PV project. Construction began in September and interconnection is expected by the end of 2013. Full commercial operation is expected in 2015. We plan to elect CITCs for Desert Sunlight as the megawatts go into service at an estimated pace of 150 megawatts in 2013, 90 megawatts in 2014 and 35 megawatts in 2015. The project has 2 long-term PPAs on the full output of the facility, both of which have already been approved by the California Public Utilities Commission. Total invested capital for the project is estimated at $2.2 billion, 50% of which represents our subsidiaries' capital obligations, and we will account for the project under the equity method of accounting.  Also adding to our solar development backlog, our newest development project, McCoy, is expected to consist of 250 megawatts of solar PV technology. We plan to develop the project so that it reaches full commercial operations in 2016. Total capital costs are expected to be approximately $1 billion. In September, we signed a PPA with the Southern California Edison for the full output of the project, contingent on the approval of the California Public Utilities Commission. This contract will be submitted for the commission's approval by the end of the year, and we expect approval in 2012. The McCoy site has further expansion capabilities, which could at least double our current plans.  Let's now spend some time to discussing our earnings expectations for the rest of 2011, as well as the next several years. Turning first to the outlook for the balance of the year, we continue to expect to come in at the low end of our original guidance range of $4.35 to $4.65. This is disappointing. We see with the benefit of hindsight that to reach the upper end of our range would have required contributions from our customer supply and proprietary trading operations that were not likely given how actual market conditions unfolded. And we have not increased and we do not intend to increase our risk exposure from those operations in an effort to make up any shortfall relative to our expectations. Having said that, it is also true that we believe that we could have and should have been at the midpoint of our original range had we executed better. Mistakes in execution are not acceptable to us and we are committed to improving. We have already taken several actions in response to the events of this year.  As far as the earnings outlook beyond 2011, we want to give you a bit more detail regarding some factors that are expected to drive results in 2012 and 2013. First, as we have indicated before, we expect that the major driver of our earnings growth over the next several years will be the investments that we continue to make at FPL. We expect these investments to reward our customers with operating efficiencies, cleaner generation and reduced fuel costs, all while keeping our bills among the lowest in Florida.  At Energy Resources, we expect the adjusted earnings drivers over the next couple of years to primarily fall into 2 different buckets. First, there are significant headwind associated with above-market hedges rolling off, as well as the expiration of PTCs and some increased costs. The second bucket contains the significant earnings contributions attributable to bringing our contract backlog of new solar and wind energy investments to completion. Although both of Energy Resources' drivers will affect our adjusted earnings expectations in the next couple of years, we expect the headwinds to be a bit stronger in 2012 while the contributions from new investments are expected to be much stronger in 2013 and beyond.  Looking at 2012 specifically, as a result of our rate agreement, FPL's earnings will be primarily based on the amount of rate base investment it makes. We expect average total rate base in 2012 to be between $24.7 billion and $24.9 billion or approximately 14% higher than in 2011. The growth in total rate base is driven primarily by generation projects that have received prior PSC approval. The variability in FPL's earnings, assuming normal conditions, is expected to fall within a relatively tight range because we have the opportunity under the rate agreement to vary the amount of surplus depreciation amortization we use to achieve an approximate 11% retail regulatory ROE.  At Energy Resources, significant headwinds primarily associated with above-market hedge roll-offs of roughly $60 million after-tax are expected to affect adjusted earnings from 2011 to 2012. Our expectations for 2012 also include PTC roll-offs and lower state tax benefits, which combined a roughly $75 million after-tax reduction to earnings compared to 2011.  In terms of offsetting positive drivers, fewer days of nuclear outages are expected to contribute approximately $60 million after-tax and new asset additions are expected to contribute roughly $70 million after-tax including higher CITC elections, which are expected to contribute approximately $20 million after-tax, all relative to 2011. We currently estimate that we will elect CITCs at approximately 450 megawatts of wind projects compared to our estimate of 275 megawatts in 2011. There are obviously other puts and takes, but these are the primary drivers we see in 2012. After accounting for all of these effects, we expect adjusted earnings per share for 2012 will be in the range of $4.35 to $4.65.  Turning to 2013, we expect FPL to have customer rates in place that will provide an appropriate cash return on the significant capital investments we continue to make. These investments in 2013 are expected to include the completion of our Cape Canaveral combined cycle project, completion of FPL's nuclear uprates at Turkey Point and St. Lucie, and the continuing construction of the Riviera Beach next-generation clean energy center.  Our customers should greatly benefit from the fuel efficiency and environmental improvements associated with these investments over their useful lives. We expect total average rate base in 2013 to be between $26.4 billion and $26.8 billion or approximately 7% higher than in 2012. In addition, the approximately 320-mile rate-regulated transmission line that our Lone Star Transmission subsidiary is building, is expected to be completed in 2013. Our expectations are that when completed, Lone Star will have approximately $800 million of utility rate base in Texas.  On this slide, we are providing you with a walk of Energy Resources' expected adjusted earnings from 2011 to 2013. The renewable energy investments we plan to commission in 2011, 2012 and 2013 provide significant earnings contributions at Energy Resources through 2013. As you can see from this chart, we expect that the growth in our solar business will contribute between $90 million and $115 million in earnings relative to 2011, with virtually all of these increased earnings coming in 2013. Driving this expected growth are the contributions from our Spain solar projects, the first half of our Genesis solar project and a portion of our Desert Sunlight project.  We expect our new wind additions, primarily the contributions from the 2011 and 2012 project additions, to contribute between $60 million and $75 million during this period. Recall that there will be no CITC earnings for new wind projects in 2013, and that we expect to have roughly $35 million of CITC earnings in 2011 so the $60 million to $75 million range you see here is net of that CITC amount. We also expect price escalators built into a number of our long-term PPAs on our existing assets to contribute approximately $55 million during this period. The tangible growth at Energy Resources that we see through 2013 resulting from these new long-term contract and investments will be partially offset by the expiration of production tax credits, higher costs and unfavorable market pricing from our merchant assets.  While we do not have the exposure to merchant prices that many of our peers have, as a result of our largely contracted portfolio, we do have some exposure that shows up here from higher price hedges that will be rolling off during this time period. In fact, from 2011 to 2013, the reduction in Energy Resources' gross margin associated with above-market hedge roll-offs is expected to be approximately $85 million. As I just pointed out a second ago, roughly $60 million of this $85 million occurs from 2011 to 2012, so there's much less headwind associated with above-market hedges rolling off in 2013. Overall, we are currently 92% hedged in 2013 in terms of equivalent gross margin for our existing assets. For your reference, we have included in the appendix to this presentation the 2012 and 2013 hedging slides.  On the 2012 slide, you will notice the reduction in our expectations for the proprietary trading business. As part of an effort to align the cost structure of our gas trading operations with our reduced expectations for the business going forward, in the first quarter 2012 we will be relocating the gas trading and scheduling operations from Houston back to our corporate headquarters in Florida. In addition to reducing costs, bringing these operations back to Florida will allow us to better integrate the teams and improve leverage across the overall business.  On the 2013 slide, note that the new investment line includes both the contributions from the 2012 additions and the 2013 additions that we already have under contract. Please also note that with the pending sale of the 5 natural gas plants, we have tried to simplify and clarify the hedging charts to align better with the primary drivers of commodity price exposure in the different parts of the portfolio. By executing on our tangible backlog of investment opportunities, we expect to be able to grow earnings at Energy Resources even in the face of the headwinds I have just described. The combination of FPL, Lone Star Transmission and Energy Resources' investments offset by the headwinds I've described for the period are expected to result in significant adjusted earnings growth in 2013 over 2012.  Turning to 2014. In addition to a full year of contributions from the 2013 Energy Resources investments I just discussed, 2014 is also expected to add the second half of our Genesis solar project, 90 megawatts of Desert Sunlight and contributions from our Canadian wind projects that we plan to put in service between 2013 and 2014. Also, the headwinds from the roll-off of above-market hedges are not present in 2014. In fact, we currently expect gross margin on our merchant assets to be up in 2014 compared to 2013. Our 2014 merchant assets gross margin is roughly 70% hedged. In addition to the contributions from Energy Resources, rate base growth at FPL is expected to be approximately 3% from 2013 to 2014. All of the investments we are making at FPL and Energy Resources are expected to meaningfully increase cash flow from operations beginning in 2013. We expect that in 2013, cash flow from operations will cover capital expenditures. And in 2014, we currently expect cash flow from operations to exceed capital expenditures and expected dividends, assuming we do not add any additional projects to our current backlog.  In 2014, we expect consolidated cash flow from operations to be approximately $5.5 billion, which would be an increase of over 35% from our consolidated expectations in 2011. Based on our current cash flow expectations and absent further new investment opportunities, we would therefore expect to be in a position to return some capital to shareholders in 2013 and 2014. We continue to believe that maintaining our strong balance sheet and capital structure is an important differentiator for us, and has added to our competitiveness at critical times over the past decade. As such, we plan to maintain this balance sheet strength and our credit metrics as we go forward. Of course, we will always look for additional opportunities to deploy capital into new investments that we would expect to produce additional value for our shareholders while maintaining our capital structure.  On a net basis from now through 2014, we expect that outstanding shares may decline slightly relative to 2011. Today, we have given you additional information to help you better understand the adjusted earnings drivers for our business over the next couple of years. In addition to the specific guidance ranges for 2011 and 2012, we have provided additional color on the expected adjusted earnings drivers for 2013 and 2014.  In summary, we continue to believe that our adjusted earnings per share will grow at an average of 5% to 7% per year through 2014 relative to a 2011 base of $4.35 to $4.65, which equates to a range of $5.05 to $5.65 in 2014 subject to all the usual caveats we provide, including normal weather and operating conditions.  Before turning the call back to Lew, I wanted to take a quick moment to thank all of you, the analysts and investors, with whom I have worked over the last few years while I was the CFO of NextEra Energy. I look forward to continuing to interact with you in my new role at Energy Resources.  With that, let me now turn the call back over to Lew for some closing remarks.
Lewis Hay: Thanks, Armando. To close, let me just say that while we're not satisfied with the financial results this year at Energy Resources, we remain very positive about our outlook for the future. During my tenure as CEO, we have never before enjoyed a position in which so much of our future is represented by projects in our current backlog with high visibility and a clear path to completion. Altogether, our backlogs total almost $20 billion of capital investments across FPL, Energy Resources and Lone Star. Our growth for the next few years will be driven primarily by growth at Florida Power & Light, where our investments are fundamentally substituting capital for fuel and thereby making our delivery system more efficient. We already have what we believe is the best customer value proposition in Florida, combining the lowest bills in the state with top-quartile reliability, award-winning customer service and the risk mitigation that comes for our clean emissions profile and we're working hard to improve this. Our investments will mean real benefits for our customers in the form of lower bill -- lower fuel bills, which means total bills will need to rise very little even in nominal terms and will likely continue to decline in real terms. As a result, we believe we should be able to earn a fair rate of return on the capital we are investing the business. This will lead to strong growth and contributions to earnings per share.  While the outlook for FPL is for fairly consistent growth, at Energy Resources, we first need to fight through the effects of some headwinds, most notably the impact of the decline in power and gas prices that has occurred over the last few years and which will somewhat mask the positive impact of the strong growth in new business through the end of next year. Nevertheless, Energy Resources has a bright and highly visible future path to growth through 2014 in the form of continued investment in new wind and solar projects. And at the same time, the mix of Energy Resources' businesses will continue to shift toward long-term contracted projects, thus improving the overall risk profile. Combining all of these, we continue to believe we can grow earnings per share at 5% to 7% per year through 2014 relative to a 2011 base of $4.35 to $4.65, which equates to a range of $5.05 to $5.65. We can -- we believe we can do so even after conservatively assuming no U.S. wind additions in 2013 or 2014. Yet we firmly believe we will find additional growth opportunities in the years ahead beyond those we have currently identified, and we will be working very hard to do so.  Notwithstanding the short-term uncertainties related to renewable energy policy, we believe that U.S. Renewable Energy policies will continue to be supportive of future investments over the long haul. We understand that we have much work to do to execute effectively against our extensive backlog of projects, and that is our immediate focus. But we will continue to seek ways to deploy new capital at attractive returns to build long-term value for our shareholders.  With that, I'm going to turn the call over to the conference moderator for questions. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Daniel Eggers, Crédit Suisse.
Dan Eggers - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Lew, maybe you kind of hit on at the end but could you talk a little more about where you guys see renewable tax policy headed and then as it relates to the backlog, how much of the solar and wind you guys have in place that's dependent upon an extension of U.S. tax policy beyond the 2012 expiration as currently laid out in law?
Lewis Hay: Okay, Dan. First of all, I'll answer the second part of your question. None of the forecast that we gave you is dependent on any future extensions or changes in tax policy. So I think that was in pretty darn good shape. As far as what we see happening right now, we don't have -- we don't even have a murky crystal ball or a clear crystal ball on this. You all read the papers and between the U.S. deficit situation and some of the partisan politics, it's hard to say where things are going to go in the short term. Although I will note, a bill has just been introduced in Congress to extend wind PTCs to 2016, which is the same period of time where the solar PTCs expire. But historically, renewables have received strong bi-partisan support and I think it will -- renewables are going to be an important part of our energy mix going forward. And the other thing that I will add is, as I think you all have seen now, over the years, the cost for renewables, wind and solar, especially, continues to come down. And so they are becoming more and more competitive. So it's proof that these incentives have worked in terms of making renewables much more cost effective. So it's hard to predict what's going to happen very short term. I'm pleased that we're in a position that we can give guidance out through 2014 that doesn't rely on any changes to U.S. energy policy. But again, as I said at the end of my prepared remarks, I see over the long haul that we will have continued support for renewables and renewables are going to be a viable business.
Dan Eggers - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: When I look at the -- what you guys laid out today that you're going to implement buybacks in '13 and '14 kind of to fill in some of the excess cash presumably because the reinvestment pipeline is slowing a bit at that point in time, should we think of that as a placeholder given the current environment, or is it just the opportunities that as you guys look out is getting a little less compelling for some of the resources or reinvestment than what you've seen in past years?
Lewis Hay: Well, let me -- first of all, we're providing you total clarity on what we've seen in terms of contracted projects, projects that we have contracted as of November 2011. It's the biggest backlog we've ever had in our history, and it's also a backlog that goes for more years than we've really ever had in history. So I wouldn't read anything more into it other than it's a very big, very positive backlog. And so the comments on our capital position and therefore share count, are really a function of those known contracted projects that we've just told you about. As I think Armando said and I said, we're going to continue to look for other opportunities and if you look at our track record of finding other opportunities, I think it's a pretty darn good bet that we will have other opportunities. But for a financial forecast, you have to make some kind of assumption at this point. We never like to assume things that we don't know about, and so I think that provides sort of a baseline kind of forecast. For sure, we're not going to go and invest in things that are dilutive or highly dilutive. So if we find new investments, they've got to have a better economic proposition than what you're seeing in the numbers we've just laid out. So I can assure you, my request to the team and the things that they're going to be incentivized on are to execute well on the projects that we've talked about, but also to keep the nose to the grindstone, if you will, in coming up with attractive investment opportunities.
Dan Eggers - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay, and one last quick question. Does the free cash flow positive position assume any sort of tax equity to monetize some of the PTC balance, or is that natural cash from operations to get to the free cash position?
Armando Pimentel: It's very small tax equity in our financial forecast going forward, but it's not to say there's not none. We have used the end tax equity -- and this by the way is your last question because we've got to get to others. We've used tax equity over the last 24 months really on not only new projects, but existing projects to do a couple of things. The cash is nice, but the real primary piece has been to reduce the amount of production tax credits that would otherwise have been capitalized on our balance sheet. And we've done a great job of that and I believe in one of our future earnings calls, we're gonna kind of lay out exactly what we've done so investors can see how good we've done on that front.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.
Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Real quick. And I apologize because when you ran through it in your prepared remarks, it's a little bit hard to catch up with. Could you run through all of the solar projects you're doing over the next 3 to 4 years, 3 to 5 years and the timeline for megawatts coming into service, please?
Armando J. Olivera: Sure. The first project would be our Spain solar project. It's really 2 projects, each slightly less than 50 megawatts. The first part of that will come in, in the first half of 2013. And the second half will come in, in the latter parts of 2013. The second project that we mentioned is our Genesis solar project. It's a 250-megawatt thermal project out in California, 125 megawatts of that project will come in mid- to last-half of 2013 and the other 125 megawatts will come in around mid-2014. The third project is Desert Sunlight. That's an equity investment by us, 50%. That megawatt is currently -- those megawatts are currently scheduled to come in roughly 150 megawatts later in 2013, roughly 90 megawatts, I'd say, probably throughout 2014 and roughly 30 megawatts, I'd say, probably the first half of 2015. And then we've got McCoy, which we talked about today. McCoy is a 250-megawatt, also a PV Project like Desert Sunlight. That's actually -- there is some CapEx from McCoy in our forecast period, it's not significant and by our forecast period, I mean through 2014. But we don't expect any earnings associated with McCoy until 2015. Most of that -- most of those earnings though will probably be in 2016.
Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And on the wind side, the CapEx you're showing for wind post-2012 largely driven by the Canadian development, I assume?
Armando Pimentel: It is all driven by our Canadian projects.
Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Got it. Last item, if I just take the very low end of your 2011 guidance, so $4.35. Take the mid-point of your 2012 guidance, let's say, $4.50-ish. To get to the midpoint of your 2014, that's implying almost a 10% year-over-year growth in '13 and '14 from '12. Is that -- can I ask a question what in terms of pricing assumptions granted that you don't have that much exposure to the forward curves? But that's a pretty big uptick, and just trying to put my arms around it a little bit.
Armando Pimentel: Well, it's the things we laid out. I'm not going to remember the slide. The slide's probably in the upper teens but it's 2012 -- I'm sorry, 2013 drivers and the 2013 drivers really come in 3 pieces. First, you've got Florida Power & Light Company, which is making significant investments to rate base in 2011, 2012. And we'll have new rates in 2013 since our rate agreement ends at the end of 2012. That's the first big driver. The second big driver's $800 million of rate base in our Texas utility our transmission utility, Lone Star. And the next big driver which we laid out really on 19, and we laid it out from '11 to '13 but it's really the Energy Resources solar projects, which I talked about in my prepared comments. So you've got first half of Genesis, you've got Spain Solar, you've got Desert Sunlight and you've got a whole bunch of wind that you're putting in, primarily in '12 as opposed to '11. And those wind projects that are going in, in '12 will have a full year of operations in 2013. When you put all that together, that accounts for the big driver from '12 to '13. The other piece that we shouldn't forget I also mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've got a -- at Energy Resources, a significant amount of headwinds from the roll-off of above-market hedges from 2011 to 2012. So if you look at Slide 19, and you look at the merchant pricing down of $85 million from '11 to '13, $60 of that is actually from '11 to '12. And so you have much less headwinds in 2013. Now I'm going just make this comment because you also had Merchant in there. On the Merchant side of the business, our Merchant gross margin at this point is not fully locked up. But even in 2014, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've got 70% of that margin in 2014 locked up. And in 2013, if you look at the new slide that's in the appendix, we've got 86% of that gross margin currently hedged. So we feel fairly comfortable that there will be a big up in adjusted earnings per share assuming we can execute on our plans. But if we execute on our plans, there should be a pretty big up in adjusted EPS from 2012 to 2013.
Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Got it. One last item, a little bit of a modeling one. O&M trajectory at Energy Resources, it actually -- if I just look at the financials on the back of your tables, it actually was down a little bit year-over-year from third quarter last year to third quarter this year. Just curious a, the driver of that especially since you've added some new assets and b, kind of the trajectory going forward.
Armando Pimentel: Trajectory going forward, I don't think is going to be -- well, we've got a whole bunch of new projects that are going in, right. So all of those new projects going in are going to have their own O&M. And let me just -- I'm going to get to the rest of your question in a second. But if you go to Slide 19, for those of you that are out there trying to model all this, the green bars that you see there, those ups that you see on those projects, those green bars are already net of the O&M for those new projects. So the O&M increase that you see on that slide which I think is part of your question, Michael, is really for existing projects, not new projects. As far as our expectations just on a general basis going forward, I wouldn't expect it to be much more than inflation and maybe it's slightly even less than inflation on a go-forward basis.
Operator: And our next question comes from Paul Patterson, Glenrock Associates.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: The CITC benefit in 2011, 2012 and 2013, I wasn't completely clear as to how we should be thinking about the level of CITC contribution to your growth rate.
Armando Pimentel: Let me give you a little shortcut. From 2010 to 2011, this is on adjusted earnings. From '10 to '11, you're down about $28 million, that's the $0.07 per share that I talked about in my prepared remarks. From 2011 to 2012, you're going to be roughly up $18 million and that's all most -- actually all associated with wind. And from 2012 to 2013, you will be up roughly $12 million. That $12 million is a net number though, because you will not have any CITC for wind in 2013, so you'll be down on the wind side probably around $62 million, that's the gross number, and you'll be up on solar roughly $74 million.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Okay, great. And what's the total number of CITC in that year?
Armando Pimentel: CITC in 2013 is probably somewhere around 275 megawatts or so, all of solar.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: And that's equals what kind of dollar amount?
Armando Pimentel: Roughly $70 million to $74 million, after tax.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Okay, great. Excellent. And then when we're looking at the slides on the hedging, the Merchant wind in New England seem to be moving in different directions year-over-year. The megawatt hours seem the same but in some cases, it seems like there's a big increase in what we're seeing.
Armando Pimentel: Yes, Paul, that's true. You should -- you and the rest of folks should understand. We try to hedge really on what I call corporate-wide basis at Energy Resources. And that means a times, we may move some hedges from some of our wind assets to some of our power assets and back and forth. And we're not really doing that to confuse you, although it might have confused folks. I think the better way to look at it would be actually to look at the total amounts that you see, especially when you're looking at Texas wind and Northeast. What's happened to those total numbers.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Jonathan Arnold, Deutsche Bank.
Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Could I just follow-up on Paul's question, and thank you for that disclosure on the '13 CITC. How should we think about that number in '14, I mean with respect to your guidance and growth rate?
Armando Pimentel: The '14 CITC number, that's actually a number I don't have in front of me. Hold on just -- do you have another question actually, Paul? I'm sorry, do you have another question, Jonathan? I don't have that number in front of me.
Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Should we try that first? The other one was on the gas plants that you recently sold where you got the operating contracts back, I think, for some varying numbers of years. Could you quantify what the benefit of those ongoing operating contracts is likely to be to earnings and where we'd be looking for that? And is it something we'd notice as in when they roll down?
Armando Pimentel: Well, we'll go back to your first question, Jonathan, because we're not going to answer that question.
Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: You're not going to answer either half of that question?
Armando Pimentel: Yes. That's -- I think that's a competitive question, and I don't think it's really appropriate for us to answer. But on your first question where you were wondering how many megawatts of CITC we would have in 2014, I'd say roughly between 200 and 215 megawatts and it's all solar at that point.
Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: So it will be a little -- there'll be a slight headwind versus '13 but not significant?
Armando Pimentel: Not significant.
Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And on my other question, I mean is this a number we'll notice when those contracts end rather than asking for a specific? Is it a driver we should even think about?
Armando Pimentel: Jonathan, here's what I would say about it, which is, obviously, it's accretive right now to earnings but it's small. And we're not doing it for free, but that O&M service is a competitive business and so it's accretive, it's small and not going to be a giant driver one way or another.
Operator: At this time, I would like to close the conference out. We thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the NextEra Energy Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Rebecca Kujawa. Ms. Kujawa, please go ahead now.
Rebecca Kujawa: Thank you, Rufus. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. Lew Hay, NextEra Energy's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of NextEra Energy's performance and recent accomplishments. Lew will be followed by Armando Pimentel, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss the specifics of our financial results. Also joining us this morning are Jim Robo, President and Chief Operating Officer of NextEra Energy; Armando Olivera, President and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light Company; and Mitch Davidson, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources, LLC, which we will refer to with the subsidiaries as Energy Resources in this presentation. Following our prepared remarks, our senior management team will be available to take your questions. We will be making statements during this call that are forward looking. These statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements. If any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call in the Risk Factors section of the accompanying presentation or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found on the Investors section of our website, www.nexteraenergy.com, we do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. Please also note that today's presentation includes references to adjusted earnings, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying this presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of the non-GAAP measure to the closest GAAP financial measure. With that, I will turn the call over to Lew Hay. Lew?
Lewis Hay: Okay. Thank you, Rebecca. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that NextEra Energy had strong performance in the second quarter. We grew adjusted earnings per share be approximately 6% over the prior year comparable quarter. Our strategy of investing in clean, renewable and efficient generation continues to drive solid results. We're executing well while continuing to enhance our generation portfolio by weighting it significantly toward regulated and long-term contracted opportunities that should enhance shareholder value. At Florida Power & Light Company, we had a strong second quarter. Net income was up approximately 14% over the prior year comparable quarter, primarily due to increased investment in the business. Over the quarter, FPL averaged more than 10,000 additional customers than we had in the first 3 months of the year. In Florida, our biggest area of concern remains the difficult employment climate in the state, with an unemployment rate of 10.6% as of June 2011, which gears the depressed national employment market. However, even in a difficult economy, our generation portfolio development pipeline at FPL -- our generation portfolio and our development pipeline at FPL is setting the pace for the industry, providing significant operating efficiencies, sustainable environmental performance and strong customer benefits. The uprate work at our St. Lucie and Turkey Point nuclear facilities in Florida is proceeding. We expect that these investments, which will add about 450 megawatts of clean, reliable, emission-free energy to our portfolio, will save FPL customers about $4.6 billion to $4.8 billion in fuel costs over the life of the plants. We've brought the third unit of our West County Energy Center online, on time and on budget. This unit adds approximately 1,220 megawatts to what is now the nation's largest combined-cycle natural-gas-fired power plant. This facility increases the efficiency of FPL's generation fleet, saves our customers money on fuel and reduces air emissions.  In June, we moved forward with the construction of the modernized $1.3 billion Riviera Beach Next-Generation Clean Energy Center by demolishing the boilers, the stacks and related equipment at the Riviera Beach plant. If you haven't taken a chance to look at it, there's a nice little clip on YouTube, kind of fun to watch. We expect the modernized plant to come online in 2014. In addition, the modernization of our Cape Canaveral plant is progressing well and is on track to meet its planned 2013 start date. These 2 combined cycle facilities, at an estimated cost of $2.4 billion, are expected to be among the most efficient natural gas plants in the nation, and we estimate that they will provide customers $850 million to $950 million in net savings over the life of the plants. Now we indicated in FPL's 10-year site plan that we would need to bring new capacity online in 2016 to meet our projected load obligations. Earlier this month, we took an initial step to seek state regulatory approval to modernize the Port Everglades facility. Like West County, Cape Canaveral and Riviera Beach, we expect a modernized Port Everglades to offer considerable customer benefits through fuel and other savings that exceed the revenue requirements over the life of the project. If it were to come online in 2016 as proposed, the Port Everglades modernization would cost roughly $1.2 billion and would use about 35% less fuel per megawatt hour and provide customers with more than $400 million in estimated net savings over the life of the plants. If this project moves forward, our investment in the Port Everglades modernization would make FPL's generation fleet even more efficient. We project a 21% efficiency improvement in our fossil system heat rate from 2001 through 2016, amounting to about $1.3 billion in annual fuel savings in 2016 compared to a 2001 baseline. These investments in Florida Electric Infrastructure also provides a significant benefit to customers in terms of efficiency and reliability. In fact, FPL customers now enjoy 99.98% service reliability. Now turning to NextEra Energy Resources. Our existing wind fleet produced an additional 766,000 megawatt hours of electricity, or a 13% increase compared to the year-ago comparable quarter, driven primarily by an improved wind resource. In addition, the 909 megawatts of assets that we added during or since the second quarter of 2010 made a positive contribution to results in the second quarter. Challenges in the quarter included the extended refueling outages at the Seabrook and Point Beach nuclear facilities as well as impairments of certain assets in West Texas and in the Northeast. While the duration of Seabrook and Point Beach outages was longer than we had anticipated, both facilities are now back online and operating well. A positive outcome of the extended Point Beach outage was that we completed the uprate work on unit 2. We expect the increased output from the units to be more than our earlier estimates of 80 megawatts, and note that all incremental power resulting from the uprate investments will be sold under a long-term contract. Since our first earning -- first quarter earnings call, we signed long-term power purchase agreements on 632 megawatts of new wind projects. Roughly 469 megawatts of that amount results from the recently signed series of contracts for projects in Ontario, Canada, which we currently expect to be online before the end of 2014. This represents a significant investment and demonstrates our commitment to growing our renewable footprint in Canada supported by long-term contracts. We're excited about the continued prospects from Canada, and with the announcement of these projects, we will be one of the largest owners of wind generation in Canada. Additionally, we have signed a 23-year contract for an average of approximately 50 megawatts of generation from our Seabrook Station nuclear facility. It's certainly been a good quarter in terms of contracting our future revenue, and I'm proud of the teams that continue to work hard to get this done. With that, I'll turn the call over to Armando before returning for some closing comments. Armando?
Armando Pimentel: Thank you, Lew, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter 2011's, NextEra Energy's GAAP net income was $580 million, or $1.38 per share. NextEra Energy's 2011 second quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $500 million and $1.18, respectively. The difference between the GAAP and adjusted results is the exclusion of the mark in our non-qualifying hedge category and the exclusion of net other than temporary impairments on certain investments, or OTTI. For the second quarter of 2011, Florida Power & Light reported net income of $301 million, or $0.72 per share. During the second quarter, FPL's contribution to earnings per share increased $0.08 relative to the prior year's comparable quarter, driven primarily by rate base growth and returns on clause-related investments, including Martin Solar and the nuclear upgrades.  As a reminder, for the term of the 2010 base rate agreement, FPL's earnings will largely be a function of its rate base and return on equity. We continue to believe that FPL will realize a retail regulatory ROE at or near 11% during each of 2011 and 2012, subject to the normal caveats we provide, including normal weather and operating conditions. For the terms of the base rate agreement, we expect that FPL will be able to amortize surplus depreciation to offset most of the variability in its normal operations, including the fluctuations due to weather. As such, general weather variability is not expected to affect earnings. Also, keep in mind that because the return on equity is calculated each month on a trailing 12-month basis, you should expect to see continued variability in FPL's quarterly earnings. During the quarter, we recognized $31 million in surplus depreciation and amortization, bringing the total amount recognized during the first 6 months of the year to $131 million. For the full year 2011, assuming normal weather and operating conditions, we currently expect to amortize between $180 million and $200 million, less than the full amount of the surplus depreciation for the year that is available to us under the base rate agreement. This estimate for 2011 is down from the range of $245 million to $265 million that we provided in our fourth quarter 2010 earnings call, largely as a result of the favorable weather experience in the second quarter. Turning to our customer metrics. The economic recovery in Florida appears to continue to take hold, but the progress is slow and uneven. As a result, some of our key metrics are mixed. The table in the upper left shows the change in retail kilowatt hour sales in the quarter versus last year's comparable period. Overall, retail kilowatt hour sales increased by 2.8%, due primarily to higher weather-related usage and an increase in customers. In the second quarter, cooling degree days were well above normal and higher than the level experienced in the prior year comparable quarter. Non-weather-related or underlying usage and all other declined by 0.6%. We continue to look at the overall picture but feel it is too early to have a clear longer-term view on customer usage.  As depicted in the graph in the upper-right-hand corner, during the second quarter 2011, we had approximately 28,500 more customers than we did in the comparable period of 2010. This is the sixth quarter in a row where we have had customer increases compared to the prior year comparable period. The graph on the bottom left of the page shows inactive and low-usage customers, which we believe are indicative of the level of empty homes in our service territory. Both of these metrics have improved relative to the same time last year. In fact, the number of inactive meters has declined approximately 5% since the end of last year's second quarter. Regarding the modest sequential increase in inactive meters in June, note that prior to the recession, we experienced strong seasonal patterns that would result in higher levels of inactive meters during the summer months. Although we cannot be certain, it is possible some seasonality may be appearing again after being largely masked by other drivers during the recession.  The chart at the lower right-hand corner shows weekly unemployment claims in Florida. The chart shows that initial jobless claims are well below the levels reached during the height of the recession. Nevertheless, the downward trend is slow, it's slope is not as steep as we would like to see, and we have seen a small uptick in the data since April. A number of the economic indicators we follow have similar patterns. There have been improvements from the peak of the recession, but progress is slow and, at times, a bit bumpy. In an effort to continue to support economic development in Florida, we've just created and staffed a new Office of Economic Development to help the governor and local economic development organizations attract businesses to the state. We believe that when businesses thrive and grow, it drives the economy and creates jobs, which benefits all of us. We continue to look for ways to partner with our communities to spur economic development here in Florida. We are the largest investor in the State of Florida, having invested on a cumulative basis approximately $33 billion in infrastructure investments. In the last 5 years alone, that investment total is approximately $12 billion. Overall, we continue to be positive regarding future developments in Florida and believe we have one of the best utility franchises in the country. Although Florida's economy has not rebounded completely from the recession, we are optimistic that the positive attributes of Florida will drive greater long-term growth over a sustained period as compared to other parts of the country. As such, we continue to make significant investments in our regulated businesses in Florida, which provide both direct benefits for our customers and earnings growth for our shareholders. Let me now turn to Energy Resources. We are pleased that since our first quarter 2011 earnings call, we secured approximately 632 megawatts in wind PPAs for new projects, of which roughly 469 megawatts are for Canadian projects we plan to put in service in 2013 and 2014. We were awarded these feed-in tariff contracts earlier this month by the Ontario Power Authority. The opportunity to develop these projects is consistent with our comments over the last several years indicating that we plan to develop more renewable energy in Canada. During June, we closed the previously announced acquisition of White Oak, a 150-megawatt wind facility in Illinois, and at the same time, we completed the differential membership transaction, often referred to as tax equity by others, relating to the project. This is the fourth differential membership transaction we have completed in the last 15 months. These transactions are attractive as they allow us to allocate the tax attributes of our investments to third-party investors that can more efficiently utilize these benefits. In essence, these transactions allow us to monetize the tax benefits of our investments in a timelier manner. We will continue to look for opportunities with both our existing portfolio and new investments to structure these tax-benefit-sharing arrangements.  On the solar front, our 2 primary solar projects, Genesis and Spain, continue to move forward. During the quarter, we were notified by the Department of Energy that our Genesis solar project received conditional approval to receive a loan guarantee from the government. This guarantee would lower the debt financing cost for the project. Our Spain projects are under construction and are progressing well. Turning to our nuclear portfolio. During the quarter, refueling outages at our Seabrook Station and Point Beach nuclear plants reduced EPS by $0.09, of which approximately $0.045 was due to the extended portions of the refueling outages. The Point Beach outage work included work associated with the upgrade of unit 2. That work consisted of approximately 3 million man hours and produced more than 80 megawatts of additional power. This is the first of 6 planned upgrades at FPL and Energy Resources nuclear units during the next 2 years. Energy Resources reported second quarter 2011 GAAP earnings of $239 million, or $0.57 per share. Adjusted earnings for the second quarter, which exclude the effect of non-qualifying hedges and net OTTI, were $159 million, or $0.37 per share. Energy Resources' second quarter adjusted EPS decreased $0.11 from last year's comparable quarter. These results included a negative $0.08 impact from the previously discussed asset impairment charges. New wind and solar investment contributions increased $0.03 relative to last year as a result of our adding 909 megawatts of wind and solar during or after the second quarter of 2010. Our estimate for full year 2011 CITC elections is unchanged from the first quarter at roughly 275 megawatts, including the 150 megawatts associated with the differential membership transaction we completed during the quarter. Although the full year earnings impact is roughly the same, under a differential membership transaction, the earnings impact is required to be fully recognized in the period the assets are placed into service as opposed to being allocated ratably throughout the year. In addition, this benefit is reported in operating income as opposed to income taxes. This resulted in a $0.01 increase in contributions from CITC this quarter compared to the prior year comparable quarter. We estimate that the full year impact of lower CITC elections in 2011 relative to 2010 will be approximately $0.07.  In aggregate, the existing asset portfolio contribution was roughly flat relative to the prior year comparable quarter. Existing wind assets contributed approximately $0.07 per share as compared to the year-ago period, driven primarily by an improved wind resource and lower depreciation expense. These items were partially offset by lower West Texas pricing. The wind resource was approximately 111% of normal, which is an improvement relative to the prior year comparable quarter of 96%. In the merchant portfolio, Seabrook's contribution to earnings decreased $0.09. The refueling outage at Seabrook reduced earnings by $0.07 per share as compared to the prior year, while the remaining $0.02 decrease was largely a result of lower hedge prices, partially offset by higher gains in the decommissioning funds.  In contracted generation, Point Beach contributed a negative $0.01. The refueling outage for unit 2 contributed a negative $0.02, substantially all of which was related to the extended portion of the outage. This was partially offset by higher gains in the decommissioning funds. White contributed $0.02 relative to last year due to the improved pricing it receives under the new long-term agreement. The remaining $0.01 of positive contributions from existing assets came from a number of small items, none of which is particularly noteworthy. The customer supply in power and gas trading businesses were down $0.01 due to weakness in the full requirements business. Power and gas trading were roughly flat. Asset sales contributed negative $0.01 from the lack of a gain realized in the prior year comparable quarter. During the quarter, we recognized impairment charges associated with certain assets, totaling $0.08 per share, $0.05 of which is due to an assessment of the fair value of our older wind assets in West Texas as a result of recent market value indications. An additional $0.02 relates to an impairment taken on a 2039-megawatt of oil-fired facilities in Maine as a result of a recently issued proposed Environmental Protection Agency regulations. Finally, $0.01 relates to the impairment of an older 50-megawatt natural gas peaking facility in Pennsylvania as well as some other impairment costs. All other factors contributed negative $0.04 per share, associated with share dilution and higher interest expense due to higher borrowings from the growth of the business. In the appendix of this presentation, we have included the updated hedging disclosure information that we typically provide in our quarterly earnings report. For 2011, equivalent gross margin estimates have been updated to reflect actual performance during the second quarter, including the impact of the extended outages at Seabrook and Point Beach and the impairment charges. We have also reduced our expectations for the power and gas trading businesses. The prevailing lower price and volatility conditions across the power and gas markets have reduced the opportunities we see for these businesses in the near term. In light of this view, we have also reduced our expectations for these businesses in 2012. All other changes in 2012 were minor. As a reminder, the 2012 slide does not yet include contributions from assets we expect to put in service in 2012.  Now we would like to turn your attention to our wind and solar development pipelines. As we have discussed over the last 9 months or so, obtaining long-term contracts on our wind pipeline opportunities has been a priority for us. Our intense focus on contracting assets along with an improving economy, which benefits energy load, and generally better economics is what we believe is driving the improved results we are seeing. In fact, Energy Resources has had plenty of success in 2010 and 2011 by signing 1,823 megawatts of long-term PPAs for new wind projects. We have signed more long-term PPAs for new wind projects thus far in the first 7 months of 2011 than we did in all of 2010. As we stand today, we now have 1,116 megawatts of long-term contracts for U.S. and Canadian wind projects that we have already put in service in 2011 or plan to put in service in 2011 and 2012. In addition, this month, we were awarded roughly 469 megawatts of contracts with the Ontario Power Authority for assets to be put in service in 2013 and 2014. Together, these projects represent an estimated $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion of planned capital expenditures in wind generation in 2011 and 2012 and $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion expected to be spent in 2013 and 2014. We are pleased to get an early start on the 2013 and 2014 pipeline, particularly with projects not dependent on U.S. incentive policies. Although we continue to believe U.S. renewable policies will support wind development beyond 2012, we are pleased with our continued expansion in Canada. In addition to our strong wind development pipeline, we also have our large solar thermal projects, Genesis and Spain, as well as some solar PV projects, in which we expect to spend approximately $2.3 billion to $2.7 billion between 2011 and 2014. To summarize 2011 second quarter results on an adjusted basis, FPL contributed $0.72, Energy Resources contributed $0.37 and Corporate and Other was a $0.09 contribution, for a total $1.18 per share for the current quarter. Corporate and Other increased $0.10 versus the prior year's comparable quarter, primarily due to previously mentioned state tax law changes, partially offset by other tax adjustments. Before turning the call back over to Lew, I want to reiterate our view that our adjusted EPS for 2011 will likely fall in a range of $4.35 to $4.65. We continue to believe that our adjusted EPS will grow at an average of 5% to 7% per year through 2014 relative to a 2011 base, subject to all the usual caveats we provide. Finally, we continue to explore the option of selling the gas-fired generation assets that we mentioned last quarter. The process is moving forward, and we plan to update you further on or before the third quarter call.  With that, let me turn the call back over to Lew for some closing remarks.
Lewis Hay: Okay. Thank you, Armando. I want to close with some perspective on why we believe NextEra Energy remains well positioned for growth.  In total, we have a strong backlog of approximately $12 billion of committed growth projects, including the major capital projects under construction at FPL, the contracted wind and solar investments at Energy Resources and the regulated transmission investments at Lone Star Transmission. Of course, our development pipeline includes many other potential projects that we continue to work on. We expect that by 2014, approximately 80% of our adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or adjusted EBITDA, will come from regulated or long-term contracted businesses. At FPL, we're executing well in the midst of one of our largest-ever development cycles, which we believe will drive significant savings for our customers. The $5.8 billion in major capital projects under construction includes modernizations of Cape Canaveral and Riviera Beach, uprates at our St. Lucie and Turkey Point nuclear plants and our Energy Smart Florida smart grid project. In addition, as previously discussed, our proposal to modernize the Port Everglades facility would add incremental investment of approximately $1.2 billion through 2016. We expect all of these projects to improve the long-term affordability and reliability of our service to FPL customers. At Energy Resources, we plan to invest more than $5 billion between 2011 and 2014 in renewable projects, for which we already have long-term contracts. Our wind development pipeline remains robust, and we remain confident in our ability to grow our wind fleet by 1,400 to 2,000 megawatts between 2011 and 2012. As we also discussed today, we have already started to build a pipeline of contracted projects we plan to put into service in 2013 and 2014. In addition to wind, we continue to believe solar is an attractive growth opportunity. We have 415 megawatts of long-term contracts in hand today for projects we plan to put into service between 2011 and 2014. Construction work at our large solar thermal projects, Genesis and Spain Solar, is proceeding well.  Finally, Lone Star Transmission represents approximately $800 million of capital expenditures that will be rate-regulated in Texas. We expect construction work on Loan Star's credit line to begin later this year and for the line to be energized in 2013. All told, we have a development backlog that we feel confident in executing and that will provide significant benefits to customers and shareholders alike. As one of the cleanest energy producers in the country, I believe NextEra Energy is well-positioned for the future in the face of increased federal regulatory activity. We've held ourselves to a higher standards, and in doing so, we are serving our customers well, doing our part for the environment and driving shareholder value. With that, I'll turn the call over to the conference moderator for questions. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And for our first question, we go to Daniel Eggers with Crédit Suisse.
Dan Eggers - Crédit Suisse AG: Lew, there's been a lot of M&A activity out in the market again, and you guys have been referenced in at least one transaction. Can you just talk or remind us a little bit about how you guys think about M&A and the strategic direction for NextEra, which seemed to go a little different direction on that deal that was talked about?
Lewis Hay: Not exactly sure what deal you're talking about, but even if I did know, I wouldn't comment specifically on it. From an M&A standpoint, our primary focus really has been on asset acquisitions that augment our portfolio and augment our strategy. I know there's been a lot of other types of activity going on in the industry today. But we're very comfortable with our overall position in the industry, and we do see opportunities, priced right, of course, that could potentially supplement the growth that -- our organic growth. Having said that, I think you all know us pretty well by now. We've been pretty much the same team that's been doing this for 10 years or more, and we try to be very disciplined in everything we do. And while we may look at a bunch of things that we think make sense, we often find that others place higher value on things that we look at than what we place on it. So we continue to look, but very selective in what we do.
Dan Eggers - Crédit Suisse AG: Okay. And I guess just on renewable policy -- renewable tax policy in the U.S., with obviously a very dynamic situation around the budget, what language or what comments have you guys been hearing as far as potential changes in policy? And if they were to start stripping out things, is there any risk of retroactive or nonperformance on 2011, 2012, 2013 tax policy commitments as you guys see talk today?
Lewis Hay: Yes. We've heard nothing about anything that would be retroactive about existing projects that have already earned their ability to have PTCs and things of that sort. And we've heard nothing, and frankly, the way the laws are written, it would be I think almost -- I guess with the government, you can never say totally impossible. But it's pretty ironclad that the ones that we've earned, we get. And I will remind you that quite a few of the projects we've been -- the more recent projects we've been doing the CITC instead of PTCs. But having said that, we have all the reason in the world to be confident that we're going to continue to earn the PTCs from our existing fleet.
Dan Eggers - Crédit Suisse AG: Maybe I didn't say that as well as I should have. With the projects you guys have secured in backlog on the wind side, presumably a chunk of them are based on the idea of mitigating the PTC or an ITC. As you guys understand it, if laws were to be changed as part of this budget compromise, would the tax benefit underlying some of those contracts be at risk of going away, forcing you to reevaluate the backlog commitments?
Lewis Hay: I don't believe so. All these projects fit within the current wall, the current statutes, and meet not only that but meet all the Safe Harbor requirements.
Operator: And for our next question, we go to Steve Fleishman of Bank of America.
Steven Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch: Lew or Armando, could you -- on this natural gas sale, I know you highlighted today a lot of the large capital commitments of new projects. Is that somewhat aligned kind of with the goal of saying that would be the target of where the proceeds for this potential sale would go to, to financing the -- these backlog projects?
Armando Pimentel: Not exactly, Steve. I mean before we had this, the gas asset sale, before we were exploring the sale of those gas assets, clearly we had a longer-term plan as to where we were going to get the both the debt and the equity to be able to fulfill these commitments. I think what I've said specifically on the gas asset sales, and, again, we're still exploring the opportunity, I don't know whether it will come to fruition or not, but assuming that it does, what I've said about any proceeds that we received from those projects is, if we have new opportunities, new opportunities that we have not yet discussed, clearly, that would be one avenue where we could use the proceeds to invest in that new commitment. If there are no new opportunities that come up other than those that we have in the forecast and we've discussed with you, then we would use those to try to determine whether we would want to rebalance our capital structure. Our comments on our capital structure before, I think, have been relatively clear, back starting in May of 2010, which is we want a strong balance sheet, we're comfortable with our current credit metrics. If we were to receive proceeds from an asset sale, then we would probably look to rebalance our structure to be consistent with our current structure and not look to necessarily improve or deteriorate from where we currently are.
Steven Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch: Okay. And then, I guess, secondly, on the first quarter call, you highlighted increased optimism on RFPs in getting, potentially, new projects. Was that really directed mainly to the projects that we saw successful here in the second quarter? Or is that broad comment still relevant to other things that you're looking at?
Armando Pimentel: It’s still relevant. We continue to be -- I think Lew mentioned or maybe I mentioned, I apologize, I forget. But we've got 1,115 or 1,116 of signed power purchase agreement on wind for projects that we expect to build in 2011 and 2012. But we also indicated today that we continue to feel comfortable with our '11 and '12 pipeline -- or '11 and '12 goal of 1,400 to 2,000. So since 1,100 is short of the 1,400, we should assume that there are still a number of opportunities out there that we feel quite comfortable with. And many that I hope -- I'm not promising anything, we're not promising anything. But some that, certainly, I would hope to announce in the third quarter call.
Operator: And for our next question, we go to Greg Gordon with the ISI Group.
Greg Gordon - Morgan Stanley: What are -- what were the economic drivers or other drivers that led to such a big chunk of PPAs being brought across the goal line in the second quarter? Has something changed in the dynamic, either the economic dynamic or the negotiating dynamic, with your counterparties in the wind business? And are your target IRRs holding up?
Armando Pimentel: A couple of things. One, I think it's right to focus on the second quarter signings, but this is really something that started, I'd say, later or at least the second half of 2010. We came into this year, in January this year, with 553 megawatts of contracts in hand for 2011 and 2012 wind. That was a very large number for us to have in hand for construction when you kind of look back at our history. In the quarter, we signed another 563 megawatts of wind, so a little higher than what we came into the year with. I've got -- 469 of that was a big chunk in Canada, where we were awarded 6 projects at one time. We've been spending time in Canada for now for the last 3 years or so. And we've gotten some success there. So I wouldn't -- we're certainly harping on it, we're very proud of it, we're happy about it, we've been working hard on it. But some of those contracts could have been done in the first quarter as opposed to the second quarter. Some of the ones in the second quarter could have been signed in the third quarter as opposed to the second quarter. I think the bigger focus here is the trend. Really since the second half of 2010, we have been successful in signing long-term agreements up to the point now where we've got over 1,100 megawatts just for '11 and '12 in hand. So I think it's a variety of factors, and I've mentioned them before. Let me just spend a couple of minutes on increased load, where you've got increased economic activity in the U.S. that's leading to increased load, that's a huge positive. The fact that the tax incentives in the U.S., at least at this point and at the end of 2012, I think is also moving people to get something done a little sooner. The economics have improved a little bit. I talked about the cost have come down, the CapEx has come down for these projects. That's helping with the economics. All that, I think, when you put it together, in addition to the focus that we put on it at a senior management level, has helped. Your last point on margins, as we continue to look at the margins that we're getting, across -- on an average basis, I think both Lew and I have said there are some contracts that we signed that don't meet this criteria. But on an average basis, we are still getting low double-digit after-tax unlevered returns. That's what we've said for a number of years we've been getting, and on average we're still there.
Greg Gordon - Morgan Stanley: Great. A couple other questions. I may have missed it, but can you explain what the $0.08 of impairments exactly were related to in the quarter?
Armando Pimentel: What the -- I'm sorry, Greg, what the...
Greg Gordon - Morgan Stanley: The $0.08 of impairment charges?
Armando Pimentel: Right. You can think about them in really in 3 buckets. The first bucket is 3 wind projects that we have in West Texas. Those wind projects have older turbine technology. As you and others will recall, we changed our depreciable life for what we described as newer wind turbine technology in the first quarter. These were not changed. This is older turbine technology. We actually received -- in April of this year, we received an unsolicited offer to buy a couple of those sites. We weren't looking to sell them, but when someone made an offer, we decided to enter into some negotiations with them. Based on the outcome of those negotiations, we, looking at the accounting rules, believed that we had to look at them for impairment. We did. And 3 of those projects in West Texas were impaired. That's about $0.05. Our fossil plant up in New England that we have, oil-fired plant. Because of the proposed Toxics Rule from the EPA, we took a look at that plant. We took our best shot at what we believed the final outcome of that rule would be. We wrote that down. That was a couple of another $0.02. And then the other $0.01 is really a variety of matters, including a small 50-megawatt peaker that we have up in the Northeast.
Greg Gordon - Morgan Stanley: Great. Final question. When we look at your 2012 EBITDA range projections for the different subsegments of the NextEra Energy business, it's the -- you've lowered your aspirations for power and gas trading a fair bit and just modestly for customer supply. What dynamics in the market have caused you to make those adjustments?
Armando Pimentel: This isn't -- I'm certainly not comparing us to other folks that are in this business. I mean, we just -- we talk about, or folks like to talk about our power and gas trading business quite a bit. It's still not a significant part of our business. But if you look at what others have said, I mean, it’s not any different than what we're seeing. There's low volatility, there's low prices in this business. And because of that, we just don't believe there's as many opportunities. We're not pursuing as many opportunities, and therefore -- which, by the way, is okay with us. I mean, we're going to pursue those opportunities that are there that revolve around our assets. But based on what we saw late in 2010, what we've seen so far in 2011 on that side of the business, it just makes sense to reduce our expectations for 2012.
Operator: And for our next question, we go to Brian Chin with Citigroup.
Brian Chin - Citigroup Inc: Can you talk about what has historically been the earnings contribution for energy efficiency programs?
Armando Pimentel: Contribution to earnings?
Brian Chin - Citigroup Inc: Right. For energy efficiency programs for Florida Power & Light, if any.
Armando Pimentel: I would say, tiny, very tiny. It’s so tiny that I don't -- it's not something I follow.
Brian Chin - Citigroup Inc: Okay, fair enough. So that means that the PSCs Tuesday's decision in terms of energy efficiency programs, should we assume that, that also has a fairly immaterial effect on the earnings outlook as well?
Armando Pimentel: Okay. Well, now I understand where you're going, now. So yesterday's -- I think it was yesterday, maybe it was -- yesterday was Tuesday. Yesterday's result at the Public Service Commission, we certainly support where they're going. One of the things that we've certainly been concerned about is the upward pressure in some of our customers' bills as a result of some of the decisions that were reached by prior commission. So slowing down, taking a look at it further, but in the meantime, not having to adopt the newer efficiency goals we think is the right way to move forward for us and for the commission. In terms of what that means for the future use of energy, which I think, Brian, is maybe where you're going. We don't know. It's not something that we sit back here and try to calculate. Our primary concern was that any increase in the customers' bills made sense from the customers' standpoint. And we didn't think that such an aggressive program as that, that had been previously proposed was appropriate.
Operator: For our next question, we go to Jay Dobson with Wunderlich Securities.
James Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc.: Armando, I was hoping you could revisit the question I think Steve asked, the very end of your answer and try the rebalance capital structure again. I did not at all understand what you said.
Armando Pimentel: Okay. Back in 2010, in May, we talked about our strong balance sheet, our strong capital position. We indicated a capital structure, an adjusted capital structure that was somewhere around 50% debt and 50% equity, again, on an adjusted basis, was reasonable for us and was a policy that we would follow longer term. So if you -- and I've repeated those comments several times since May of 2010. If you follow-up on that, right, and you get proceeds -- and this is hypothetical -- you get proceeds from an asset disposition, and there are not new opportunities that you already don't have in your forecast, then you would use those proceeds to rebalance your capital structure back to an adjusted 50-50 basis, which we have said over time works for us.
James Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc.: Perfect, that is very clear. I just want to make sure I got that right. Could you then go on to the $0.10 benefit versus a year ago in the corporate and other, talk a little bit about these tax benefits and what exactly is going on there? And how much of that is sort of a go-forward basis?
Armando Pimentel: Well, the only -- you're talking about the current quarter?
James Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc.: Yes, the $0.10. So you got $0.09 for corporate and other benefit this year versus the loss of $0.01 a year ago.
Armando Pimentel: Yes, there's not really much more to add to that. There were several states that changed their tax laws during the second quarter. I mean that's when these legislators are in session all across the country. We're in 26 or 27 states at this point on the Energy Resources side of the business. And as those states change the way they calculate state income taxes or they change their tax rates, for GAAP purposes, you got to go to your deferred income taxes that you have on the books, and you have to reprice of them. And that's exactly what we did. I mean there's nothing, really, else to say about that.
James Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc.: Okay, great. And then last on the CITCs, the $0.07 that essentially will be the difference in the second half relative to a year ago. Would you take a stab at trying to split that third quarter to fourth quarter? The obvious preponderance historically has been signing up these contracts sort of towards year end. So my gut tells me a lot of that will be in the fourth quarter, but was wondering if you couldn't give us at least some idea how that $0.07 might split.
Armando Pimentel: The $0.07 actually is the annual difference between 2011 and 2010, right. So that's -- I would say that most -- you know what, I was going to say fourth quarter. It's probably ratably with one exception, and the exception will just get into a difficult explanation. But it's ratably, and the reason it's ratably is because under the accounting rules, the full benefit that you're expecting for the year, you actually have to allocate on a quarterly basis, right? You allocate to each quarter based on what you expect to have of the end of the year, and the allocation is actually based on the amount of pretax earnings that you have in each quarter. So if you would have had the same expectation at the beginning of the year for 2010 and 2011, right, you would have said 600 megawatts of CITC for '10 and '11, then the only difference on the quarterly allocation basis would be the difference in pretax income for each quarter. So last year, I think we started the year with 600 megawatts of expected CITC. This year we started, I think, with 275 megawatts of CITC. The difference of that is $0.07. Assuming no change in pretax earnings allocation between the quarter, let's just take that as an assumption, the $0.07 would be ratably allocated throughout the year. The one exception is we talked about White Oak, 150 megawatts, in the second quarter, because that was a project financed under differential membership interest or tax equity. The full benefit of that one actually happened in the second quarter.
Operator: We'll go next to Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.
Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: When you're thinking about next year's Florida rate case and kind of what the requests will likely be, how much does -- what's happening with the depreciation reserve impact what your rate case request could potentially be? Meaning, how much do you think you could potentially have to carry over into 2013 or beyond or as a potential kind of negotiating piece as part of the rate case process?
Armando Pimentel: I hate to speculate or be premature on 2013 and the rate case, something that at least at this point we have not committed to. I think the only piece that would be fair to say is that in the settlement agreement, right after the rate case, that agreement indicated the amount that would be left over, presumably you would use the full amount through 2012. That was the expectation of the agreement, that the amount that will be left over, which was roughly $120 million or so, would be amortized in 2013. So I think it's fair to say that. But I think it's some speculation as to what we would say would happen to anything that would be unused based on the expectations that we, the staff and the intervenors had going into the 2010 settlement agreement.
Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Okay. But it's safe to assume that if you don't use of the full amount over the next 6 quarters through the end of 2012 -- I mean, through the end of 2012, that something in the rate-making structure will have to be done in terms of dealing with the leftover depreciation reserve amount?
Armando Pimentel: I think it's fair to say that, right. Obviously, you've gone through the end of 2012. In your example, you haven't used all of the amortization. And so the expectation that you would use that roughly $120 million that was left at the end of 2012 in 2013, I think there would have to be a discussion as to whether that $120 million still remained the reasonable number and the appropriate number to use in 2013.
Gary Hovis - Argus Research Company: Got it. Last, coming to Texas a little bit. Can you talk a little bit about what the progress you're seeing not just in your CREZ transmission project, but CREZ overall in terms of meeting the original deadlines and what that could mean for some of your wind plants there?
Armando Pimentel: We're actually seeing -- we just had a discussion about this the other day. We're doing well. We're on plan to certainly have that line up in 2013. And based on the information that we have, it also appears that the other participants are doing well. Again, based on the information we have, which is obviously a big positive not just for our wind fleet, but also a big positive for the customers of -- the customers in Texas, all customers in Texas. So I don't -- I can't quantify it, but I would say that if it stays, if our line and the other lines stay on plan, that I would see very little downside to our wind assets in Texas, and, clearly, there would be more upside.
Operator: We'll go next to -- I apologize, Verduga Murphy [ph] with CDP capital.
Unknown Analyst - : A couple of things. One, in terms of the gas-fired generation assets that you're potentially looking to monetize, unless I missed it, I apologize, can you remind us what the book value is of the group of assets that you are marketing or have potentially have available?
Armando Pimentel: We have not. You didn't miss it, because we haven't said what that is at this point.
Unknown Analyst - : Because I would certainly help in terms of some of the reallocation questions and some of the other questions about how you get to your balance capital structure. So you can't help us even in terms of a broad range so that we have something to work with?
Armando Pimentel: Yes. That actually, if I understand your question correctly, we haven't said for a number of reasons. One of the reasons is exactly what you're trying to get to. And I really, at this point, don't want people to kind of speculate as to what the proceeds are and then kind of back into some numbers. But the more important question isn't necessarily what the basis is. The more important question is what is the debt on those assets, right? Because if you sell the assets, you're going to have to potentially use some of the proceeds to pay the debt on those assets. But we haven't said that either. We haven't talked about the carrying costs, we haven't talked about the debt. We'll have more to -- everybody just needs to be a little patient. We'll have more to say, hopefully, before the third quarter earnings call.
Unknown Analyst - : Okay, that's fair. And also, can you talk about your investment in PetroQuest and how much of that is to date, kind of what the strategy is and what future capital commitments you have going forward there and just what -- kind of how that fits into things?
Armando Pimentel: I don't have the numbers with me. So let me just kind of reference what we have said before, and PetroQuest, obviously, is part of this. We indicated in May of 2010 that we would expect about $400 million to $600 million of capital into this business. And this business really is the PetroQuest business, which is the shale drilling business. We're not at the $600 million, we're not at the $400 million at this point, so we continue to deploy capital towards our PetroQuest joint venture and other joint ventures. If I don't know what the number is, though, that means it’s not something that I follow every day. So it's important, I don't want to say it's not an important part of the business. But we're spending this year an estimated $6 billion to $6.5 billion of CapEx at combined NextEra Energy. We might spend $100 million to $150 million of that in gas infrastructure. So good business, important part of the business, just not very significant.
Unknown Analyst - : And when we think about that capital, how should we think about that being capitalized? Should we just assume the 50-50 kind of targeted goal? Or is it going to be different?
Armando Pimentel: You should assume -- if you're talking about the gas infrastructure part of the business, is that what you're talking about?
Unknown Analyst - : Yes, the segment.
Armando Pimentel: Okay. Well, you should assume that it's capitalized no different than any other part of our business, so adjusted 50-50. You should not assume that we make investment decisions on a 50-50 basis. At the end of it, we're making investment decisions based on the risks associated with that business. The risks, obviously, of that business are different than the risks that we would see for Energy Resources or other parts of the business, right? And so therefore, the weighted average cost of capital that we believe we would have to get from that business is different. But if you're talking about how it's capitalized from a corporate level, it's -- our entire balance sheet is capitalized on the Energy Resources level to a 50-50 business on an adjusted basis. And by adjusted basis, I mean they're -- we talked about this before. They are -- equity is not the only thing that gives you equity credit. There are equity-linked instruments that give you equity credit. We've used those before. We get credit from the agencies because they have a high amount of credit -- of equity content. So don't assume it's just debt and pure equity.
Unknown Analyst - : Okay, and one last question on this topic. The $400 million to $600 million that you talked about in the business. Over what time period was that contemplated? And under what circumstances or situations would you contemplate potentially increasing that in some fashion?
Armando Pimentel: It was through 2014. And if it is increased, and we have no plans to increase it at this point, it wouldn't be a very significant increase.
Operator: And for our final question, we go to Hugh Wynne with Sanford Bernstein.
Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.: I just wanted to get your medium-term outlook for the growth of renewable generation in the U.S. and the opportunities it creates for you. On the one hand, if we look at the mandatory renewable generation targets set by the 30-odd states that have in the next 5-year period of fairly rapid growth. But my concern is that, that growth is concentrated in a handful of states that have the most ambitious targets and that meeting those targets may translate into rate increases that could translate into a bit of political backlash against the cost of renewable generation, particularly as the federal tax incentives roll off in 2014. So I was wondering what your medium-term outlook for the growth of U.S. renewable generation is, the opportunities it creates for you, and what are the risks to that outlook?
James Robo: Wynne, this is Jim Robo. I think, first of all, you have to realize we think about the renewable business in North America is holistically, right? And we talked about that today. And solar, for example, has incentive visibility through the end of 2016. We have a whole Canadian pipeline that right now runs through the end of 2014. We have a lot of visibility into both of those, and we have a wind pipeline that runs through the end of 2012. And right now, there's some uncertainty as to what happens post-2012 from a federal incentive side -- standpoint on wind. We feel like in the long term that wind is an important piece of the energy mix in the U.S. and that there's going to be continued support for that. But there's some uncertainty around the short-term impacts, particularly in 2013, if we're watching closely. But in the long term, we're very optimistic about the wind business in the U.S. as well for one of the reasons you talked about, which is the state renewable portfolio standards. So I think we can talk to our own backlog and our own portfolio and, say, we just talked about it today over several billion dollars of wind and solar that we have signed today that we're going to be building between now and the end of 2014. And I can tell you we're not sending the teams home tonight and saying you're done for the balance for the next 3 years. They're going to be working on new things as well to get done between now and the end of 2014. So we feel very good about our own prospects.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2011 Q1  (2011-04-29 09:00:00) =====
Executives: Armando Pimentel - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President of Finance, Chief Financial Officer of Florida Power & Light Company and Executive Vice President of Finance - Florida Power & Light Company James Robo - President and Chief Operating Officer Lewis Hay - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Chairman of Executive Committee, Chairman of FPL Energy LLC and Chairman of Florida Power & Light Company Rebecca Kujawa - 
Analysts: Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates Mark Burnett James Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc. Steven Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the NextEra Energy First Quarter 2011 Earnings Release Conference call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Rebecca Kujawa. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Rebecca Kujawa: Thank you, Casey. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter 2011 conference call. Lew Hay, NextEra Energy's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of NextEra Energy's performance and recent accomplishments. Lew will be followed by Armando Pimentel, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss the specifics of our financial results. Also joining us this morning are Jim Robo, President and Chief Operating Officer of NextEra Energy; Armando Olivera, President and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light Company; and Mitch Davidson, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources, which we will refer to as Energy Resources in this presentation. Following our prepared remarks, our senior management team will be available to take your questions. We will be making statements during this call that are forward looking. These statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements. If any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call in the Risk Factors section of the accompanying presentation or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found on the Investors section of our website, www.nexteraenergy.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. Please also note that today's presentation includes references to adjusted earnings, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying this presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of the non-GAAP measure to the closest GAAP financial measure.  With that, I will turn the call over to Lew Hay. Lew?
Lewis Hay: Okay. Thank you, Rebecca, and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy delivered solid results in the first quarter of 2011. Although our adjusted earnings per share results were flat to last year's comparable quarter, the results were in line with our expectations. At a time of weak natural gas and power prices, this is particularly noteworthy.  During the quarter, we continued to make considerable investments in Florida's electrical infrastructure, which are helping to keep prices low and reliability high. One of the highlights of the quarter was that at Energy Resources, we signed long-term power purchase agreements for an additional 400 megawatts of wind power since the beginning of the year. In addition, our existing wind fleet generated nearly 1 million megawatt hours of additional power compared to last year's comparable quarter. As you know, since our last earnings call, the people of Japan experienced one of the worst earthquakes and tsunamis in modern history, including extensive damage to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant. Our sympathies go out to the Japanese people as they rebuild their country and their lives. Here in the United States, we continue to watch the events in Japan very closely. There is still much we do not know about the events at the Fukushima plant, and it will undoubtedly take much more time for full analysis to be completed.  With regard to NextEra Energy's nuclear fleet, I can tell you that all of our plants are located outside areas deemed "high hazard" for seismic activity. In addition, 7 of the 8 units we operate are pressurized water reactors with redundant cooling systems and multi-layered containment systems. In fact, our Florida PWRs are battle tested, having maintained plant and public safety through several direct and nearly direct hit by major hurricanes including Andrew, Francis, Jean and Wilma. The one boiling water reactor in our fleet, the Duane Arnold Energy Center in Iowa, is not in an active seismic zone, has a higher flood margin than the Japanese plant and stores backup diesel generator fuel underground in a steel-reinforced concrete structure. Simply put, the drivers for a Japanese-style nuclear event are highly unlikely at any of the NextEra Energy nuclear units.  Going forward, I remain optimistic that nuclear power will play a significant role in our nation's energy mix. For our part, we are on schedule with our existing plan to boost the output of our nuclear fleet through a series of uprates to the nonnuclear components of the plants. Now with regard to new nuclear, our position is unchanged. We still plan to move forward in a stepwise fashion to create the option to build 2 additional units at the site of our Turkey Point plant. Creating the option at this stage is limited to obtaining the necessary federal, state and local approvals.  At Florida Power & Light, we had a strong first quarter. Net income was up roughly 7% over the prior-year comparable quarter, primarily due to increased investment in the business. Those investments have allowed FPL to provide its customers with 99.98% service reliability and to significantly improve the efficiency of our power generation fleet, saving customers hundreds of millions of dollars in fuel costs. During the first quarter, FPL had roughly 30,000 more customers than we had a year earlier. In fact, we've now added customers for 5 quarters in a row. We think this is a positive commentary on the slow but steady improvement in the Florida economy. The biggest area of concern remains the unemployment rate, which is at a stubbornly high 11.1%. Housing prices in Florida may show further declines, but the market has clearly repriced itself, making the state a much more attractive destination.  On the development front, we are nearing completion of the West County Energy Center Unit 3. The addition of 1,220 megawatts of highly efficient combined-cycle gas generation to our system is a triple win. When it comes online, the new unit will save customers money on fuel, reduce air emissions and start to provide shareholders with a cash return on their investment.  Construction is also under way on the modernization of our Cape Canaveral and Riviera Beach power plants. When complete in 2013 and 2014, respectively, these modernizations will add 2,420 megawatts of even more fuel-efficient combined-cycle generation to our fleet. We were also pleased to dedicate our Martin Next Generation Solar Energy Center in the first quarter. The 75-megawatt Martin facility is the first in the world to combine a solar thermal array with an existing combined-cycle natural gas plant, which is a more efficient way of deploying solar thermal technology than on a stand-alone basis. FPL has now completed all 110 megawatts of solar power allowed under the 2008 legislation enacted in the state. The net cost to the average customer using 1,000 kilowatt hours of electricity is expected to be less than $0.25 a month on average over the lives of these assets. Solar power holds great potential for Florida. It can boost fuel diversity, create good-paying construction jobs, reduce air emissions and attract research and development dollars to the state. We continue to look forward to working with the state's regulatory and political leaders to expand the state's solar generating capacity in the future. On the Energy Resources side of our business, we had a mixed quarter. Our existing assets performed extremely well. I was particularly pleased that we generated nearly 1 million additional megawatt hours or a 21% increase from our wind fleet than we did in the prior-year's comparable quarter, mostly on the strength of the wind resource. However, low power prices continue to impact our merchant assets and our full requirements business experienced more customer migration than we expected. You've heard me say for some time that we believe solar has the potential to be the next wind industry for NextEra Energy, and we are pleased with the progress we made on our solar strategy in the first quarter. Of particular note was our success in securing lines of credit for our two 49.9-megawatt solar thermal arrays that we are building in Spain. Lines of credit limit our financial exposure associated with the risks associated with potential future changes in the Spanish renewable tariff to an amount significantly less than the capital cost of the project. We believe the economics of Spain solar remain attractive and we expect the project to help drive the company's earnings, starting in 2013. Here at home, we are very encouraged that California enacted into law a robust renewable portfolio standard. The law requires load-serving entities to obtain 33% of their power from renewable sources by 2020. With this move, California has made itself one of the most attractive renewable energy markets in the nation, and we look forward to doing additional business in the state.  On the wind development front, we have signed long-term power purchase agreements, or PPAs, on 400 megawatts of projects so far in 2011. That brings the total number of wind PPAs to 1,638 megawatts since the beginning of last year. Of particular note, 953 megawatts of these PPAs are for projects we expect to commission in 2011 and 2012, demonstrating our commitment to lining up customers for wind energy early in the process.  We are also seeing a noticeable spike in the number of requests for proposals being issued for wind energy. With the economics of wind improving as a result of better turbine technology and lower turbine prices, wind PPA contracts are very attractively priced. As a result, more buyers are stepping up to take advantage of these prices.  While earnings at Energy Resources are, by their very nature, more volatile than they are at FPL, I want to emphasize once again how well hedged we are on the competitive side of our business. For 2011, 96% of our gross margin at Energy Resources is protected from swings in commodity prices and for 2012, the figure is already 91%. By 2014, we expect that approximately 80% of our adjusted EBITDA will come from investments that are either regulated or long-term contracted, up from 74% in 2010. This reflects our continued focus on investing in regulated assets at FPL and long-term contracted assets at Energy Resources. As we continue to grow the business, we believe this strategy will allow us to continue to deliver strong shareholder returns to our investors.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Armando Pimentel before returning for some closing comments. Armando?
Armando Pimentel: Thank you, Lew, and good morning to everyone. In the first quarter of 2011, NextEra Energy's GAAP net income was $268 million or $0.64 per share. NextEra Energy's 2011 first quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $392 million and $0.94, respectively. The difference between the GAAP and adjusted results is the exclusion of the mark in our nonqualifying hedge category and the exclusion of net other than temporary impairments on certain investments or OTTI. For the first quarter 2011, Florida Power & Light reported net income of $205 million or $0.49 per share. For the term of the 2010 base rate agreement, FPL's earnings will largely be a function of its rate base and return on equity. As we indicated in the fourth quarter 2010 earnings call, we believe that FPL realized a retail regulatory ROE at or near 11% during each of 2011 and 2012 subject to the normal caveats we provide, including normal weather and operating conditions. For the terms of the settlement agreement, FPL won't be able to amortize surplus depreciation to offset most of the variability in its normal operations, including the fluctuations due to weather.  During the first quarter, FPL's contribution to earnings per share increased $0.02 relative to the prior year's comparable quarter, driven primarily by allowance for funds used during construction, or AFUDC, for West County Energy Center #3, returns on clause-related investments, including Martin Solar and a nuclear uprate and rate-based growth, which was partially offset by share dilution. During the quarter, we recognized $99 million in surplus depreciation on a pretax basis. We currently do not expect to amortize the full amount of surplus depreciation in 2011 that is available to us under the base rate agreement. We are continuing to see improvements in some of our key customer metrics. The table on the upper left shows the change in retail kilowatt-hour sales in the quarter versus last year's comparable period. Overall, retail kilowatt-hour sales fell by 6.2%, a decline due primarily to lower weather-related usage and partially offset by an increase in customer growth.  In the first quarter, heating degree days were modestly below normal and well below the record heating degree days experienced in the prior-year comparable quarter. Nonweather-related or underlying usage and all other declined by 0.2%.  As depicted in the graph in the upper right-hand corner, during the first quarter of 2011, we had roughly 30,000 more customers than we did in the comparable period of 2010. The graph on the bottom left of the page shows inactive and low-usage customers, which we believe are indicative of the level of empty homes in our service territory. In March, the percentage of low-usage customers experienced its first monthly decline since September 2010. The number of inactive residential meters has declined for 6 months in a row.  Perhaps contributing to these improvements is the fact that homes in FPL markets are continuing to become more affordable. As depicted in the graph on the bottom right, the current housing affordability index, which measures the percentage of medium-income families who can afford a home, is now 66% for Miami. That is up from 11% of the peak of the boom in late 2006 and close to the national average of 73%. As you can also see in the graph, affordability in several of our other cities is now above the national average. Traditionally, housing affordability has been one of Florida's advantages, and we believe Florida will continue to be a very attractive destination to which people and industry will move. Let me now turn to Energy Resources. We are pleased that since the beginning of the year, we secured approximately 400 megawatts in wind PPAs, all of which are for projects we plan to put into service into 2011 or 2012. We will talk more about the current wind generation development and contracting environment in a couple of minutes.  During the quarter, we completed a review of the estimated useful life of the wind turbines we had in our portfolio as of January 1, 2011. As you know, we have an ongoing obligation to revisit the assumptions used to account for our assets, including the assumptions that drive the estimated useful life. Over time, the technology employed in wind turbines has improved. With proper maintenance, we believe our fleet will last longer than previously estimated. As a result of this review, we have extended the estimated useful life for our newer wind turbine fleet to 30 years, which is roughly in the middle of our updated view of the probable range of useful life. For the assets already in service, the after-tax impact of the change in assumption for the first quarter was roughly $0.025 per share. For full year 2011, the impact is expected to be roughly $0.105 per share. We will have more to say on the impact of our -- to our forward adjusted EPS expectations in a moment. During April, we completed another differential membership transaction relating to 483 megawatts of wind capacity encompassing 5 projects. This transaction, which is similar to the one we completed in the third quarter of 2010, represents a unique structure for Energy Resources in which the differential membership investor makes an initial up-front payment and will make additional payments over time, tied to the energy production of the wind projects. The structure allows us to raise tax equity for existing projects that have been previously financed with project debt. We continue to seek opportunities to minimize the growth of our deferred production tax credits, or PTCs, on our balance sheet, and the availability of this structure will allow us to receive compensation for future PTCs before we would have otherwise been able to monetize them.  As Lew noted, we closed on lines of credit this week for our solar thermal arrays that we are building in Spain, which has made available to us roughly EUR 590 million or approximately $875 million. The lines of credit limit our financial exposure associated with potential future changes in the Spanish renewable tariff to an amount significantly less than the capital cost of the projects. Just as with all of our other projects, we retained construction and performance risk, which we believe we are well prepared to address.  These lines of credit are important steps in the development of these projects and we are very pleased to be moving forward. As we indicated to you at our May 2010 investor conference, we believe these projects will provide attractive returns and valuable experience in the expanding market for solar generation. We continue to expect to bring online both of the 49.9-megawatt units in 2013. Energy Resources reported first quarter 2011 GAAP earnings of $65 million or $0.16 per share. Adjusted earnings for the first quarter, which exclude the effect of nonqualifying hedges and net OTTI, were $189 million or $0.46 per share. Energy Resources' first quarter adjusted EPS decreased $0.01 from last year's comparable quarter. New wind and solar investment contributions were flat relative to last year. Results increased $0.02 due to the contributions from assets placed into service in the first quarter of 2010 that were available for a full quarter in 2011, as well as our ability to recognize state investment tax credits on some of our wind projects. These positive items were offset by lower expected contributions from convertible investment tax credits, or CITCs, for 2011. Regarding our 2011 CITC elections, we concluded during the first quarter that it was probable that we would elect to take CITCs on roughly 275 megawatts of new wind projects we expect to be completed during 2011. Ultimately, we believe our elections will likely range between 275 and 375 megawatts, depending on a variety of factors, including when the assets are placed into service. This is down from our previous expectations, largely as a result of converting certain potential CITC projects to PTC projects as a result of refining and evaluating their overall economics.  For reference, we elected CITCs on 603 megawatts of new wind projects in 2010 and had assumed 600 megawatts of annual elections in last year's first quarter. The difference in the estimated CITC annual elections reduced adjusted EPS by approximately $0.02 relative to the comparable quarter. Assuming the lower end of our 2011 CITC range, the full year impact would be approximately $0.08 relative to the prior year. In aggregate, the existing asset portfolio contributed $0.10 relative to the prior-year comparable quarter. Existing wind assets contributed approximately $0.17 per share as compared to the year-ago period, of which $0.10 was due to an improved wind resource and lower curtailments. The wind resource was approximately 93% of normal, which was an improvement relative to the prior-year comparable quarter 80%. The remaining $0.07 was a result of our ability to recognize state investment tax credits on some of our wind projects and a lower depreciation expense due to the change in the depreciable life of some of our wind assets, slightly offset by unfavorable pricing. Seabrook and Maine Hydro contributed $0.06 less than in the prior-year's comparable quarter, primarily due to lower priced hedges.  Weak market conditions and higher O&M, due to planned outages affecting our merchant Texas gas assets, resulted in $0.02 lower adjusted earnings per share. The customer supply in power and gas trading businesses are down $0.07, due primarily to our wholesale full requirements business, as well as the absence of the sale of a favorable supply contract completed in the first quarter of 2010. During this year's first quarter, we realized a negative impact from customer migration in our wholesale full requirements business, costing us roughly $0.03 on an adjusted basis.  Also, in last year's first quarter, the sale of a power supply contract in this business increased adjusted EPS by approximately $0.03. Asset sales contributed a negative $0.03 entirely due to the absence of the benefit associated with last year's sale of our interest in a 27-megawatt waste-to-energy facility located in Pennsylvania. All other factors contributed negative $0.01 per share associated with higher interest expense due to higher borrowings and higher corporate G&A, both from growth of the business. As we mentioned earlier, since the beginning of the year, we signed new power purchase agreements for 400 megawatts of new wind projects. This brings us to a total of 953 megawatts of projects, for which we have contracts and expect to commission in 2011 and 2012 and 1,638 megawatts of PPAs we have signed since the beginning of 2010.  Given the high level of visibility we have for the 2011 and 2012 pipelines, we believe that we will add -- we will be able to add between 1,400 to 2,000 megawatts of wind before the end of 2012. We have, however, a little less visibility than in prior years as to the amount we may add in the current year, primarily as a result of some timing issues associated with permitting. So although we feel fairly confident on the build over the next couple of years, we believe meeting the bottom end of our previous 700- to 1,000-megawatt range in 2011 will be a challenge. Turning briefly to asset acquisitions. As we have indicated to you many times, we are as interested in acquiring contracted clean generation projects as we are in building them ourselves, as long as the returns are attractive. We are not, however, interested in purchasing or developing any additional assets outside of North America for the foreseeable future.  In addition to acquiring assets, you should also expect that we will continuously look at our entire portfolio of existing assets to make sure that we are optimizing the value of those assets. In some circumstances, it may mean that we would sell certain of our existing assets. Currently, we are exploring the potential sale of 5 of our natural gas-fired assets at Energy Resources, including Blythe, a 507-megawatt plant in California; RIEC [Rhode Island Energy Center], a 550-megawatt plant in Rhode Island; Doswell, a 879-megawatt plant in Virginia; Cherokee, a 98-megawatt plant in South Carolina; and Calhoun, a 668-megawatt plant in Alabama. While there are attractive aspects for each of these assets, they have a limited strategic fit within our portfolio. As such, we are investigating whether or not these assets may possess a higher strategic value to another owner. At this time, we can give no assurance that an actual sale will take place. To summarize 2011's first quarter results on an adjusted basis, FPL contributed $0.49, Energy Resources contributed $0.46, and Corporate and Other was a negative $0.01 contribution. That is a total of $0.94 per share for the quarter. Before turning the call back over to Lew, I wanted to spend a couple of minutes discussing our adjusted EPS expectations. As we indicated earlier, the change in the assumption regarding the estimated useful life for a portion of our wind fleet has a positive impact on adjusted EPS in the quarter, and it is expected to have roughly a $0.105 positive impact on full year 2011 adjusted EPS. Solely as a result of this change, we are increasing our adjusted EPS expectations to a range of $4.35 to $4.65 from the previous range of $4.25 to $4.55. When we initially provided long-term adjusted EPS expectations at the May 2010 investor conference, the 5% to 7% average annual growth rate through 2014 was relative to a 2009 base. However, the change in the estimated useful life assumption renders future years' comparison to 2009 less relevant. As a result, we are updating our long-term expectation and we believe that our adjusted EPS will grow at an average of 5% to 7% per year through 2014 relative to a 2011 base, subject to all the usual caveats that we provide. As we have indicated before, we believe public policy support for wind generation development will ultimately be extended beyond 2012. Historically, wind has enjoyed public policy support under both Republican and Democratic leadership, and our current views is that we will continue to be successful in developing and owning wind plants for many years to come. However, we would like to put into context the impact of a potential slowdown in our expected wind build after the current federal policy on wind energy expires. If we were to assume no additions of wind assets to our operations after 2012, our adjusted EPS compounded annual growth rate would continue to be within the range of 5% to 7% through 2014 from a 2011 base.  With that, let me now turn the call back over to Lew for some closing remarks.
Lewis Hay: Okay. Thanks, Armando. I'd like to conclude this morning with a few observations about the policy framework in which the electric power industry operates. Since the election of last fall, many pundits have predicted a sea change in the nation's approach to energy policy. That strikes me as premature. Yes, it's true that cap and trade is off the table for the foreseeable future, but in other ways, efforts to make the nation's energy supply cleaner, more efficient and more diverse are proceeding apace. In March, the Environmental Protection Agency released its proposed rule to tighten limits on how much mercury and other toxic air pollutants power plants are permitted to release. And in the months and years ahead, the agency will be moving forward with regulations on coal ash, particulate matter, SOx and NOx.  I don't believe that replacing 50-year-old fossil plants with new, more efficient units will be the train wreck we have been hearing so much about, nor do I believe that putting pollution controls on many of the remaining plants is all that terrible. As an aside, it is interesting to note that 2/3 of our nation's coal fleet is without meaningful pollution controls. While there is no free lunch, the cost of this upgrade to the nation's generation fleet is likely to be far less than the costliest predictions.  Consider our own utility. In 2010, FPL recorded a SO2 emissions rate 76% below the industry average, a NOx emissions rate 65% below the industry average and a CO2 emissions rate 36% below the industry average. Yet despite having one of the cleanest generation fleets of any utility in the nation, FPL's typical residential customer bills were 24% below the national average at the year-end 2010. We are proof that utility can be clean and cost-effective at the same time. In addition to EPA action, I still believe bipartisan action is possible on energy legislation that would encourage cleaner generation and greater fuel diversity. With the cost of renewables, such as wind and solar, photovoltaic coming down so dramatically over the last couple of years, one of the principal objections to a national clean energy standard is now far less compelling.  On a final note, I want to extend a special thanks to the 15,000 employees of NextEra Energy. Last month, NextEra Energy was ranked #1 in its sector on Fortune Magazine's Most Admired Companies list for the fifth consecutive year. No other company in our sector has ever done that. Just as impressive, we are ranked as the 10th most admired company in the world for social responsibility. Less than 2 weeks later, we were named one of the world's most ethical companies by Ethisphere Magazine. We are one of only 24 companies worldwide to appear on the list all 5 years of its existence. These accomplishments are possible only through the commitment of our employees, and I want to thank them all.  With that, I'll turn the call over to the conference moderator for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Steve Fleishman with Bank of America.
Steven Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch: A couple of questions. First, maybe, Armando, could you give a little bit of color on the thought process between the CITCs and the PTCs and how that's changing, just so we understand kind of how that thought process there.
Armando Pimentel: You want to ask your second question, or is that...
Steven Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch: The second question is related to the potential gas asset sale and just conceptually should -- if there's any tax gain, should you be able to use your deferred tax against that? And if you could, the tax basis of those assets?
Armando Pimentel: Okay. Let me give you some input on both of those. Your first question was on the change that we're talking about today. I think in the last couple of quarters, we've indicated that for 2011, we were looking at CITCs in the range of 400 to 550 megawatts. And today, I said in the first quarter, we were using 275 megawatts. What's happened really over the last, I'd say, 3 to 6 months is -- and we always continually do this. We always continually look at our projects to determine whether ultimately they should be CITC or PTC projects. We've continued to see -- I mean, this isn't something that certainly caught us by surprise in the last month or so, but we have continued to see improvements in technology. And we've been able to use that technology in some of our previously identified sites, not in all previously identified sites, and it has kind of flipped the switch on the economics from CITC to regular production tax credit projects. Now part of that, obviously, is we continue to be comfortable with our tax position, but our deferred tax assets had been rising and we know they've been rising according to our forecast. That doesn't surprise me or concern me. But the other part of this is that the tax equity market has really come back pretty aggressively, I'd say, in the last 9 months or so. And so when we are thinking about the economics of a wind project, particularly switching from CITC to PTC, it's both an economic view of the project, with wind turbine technology obviously being a big part of that, but it's also the financing of the project. And with the tax equity market coming back pretty aggressively, we've been able to turn several of our CITC projects to PTC projects. So there's nothing else in there. There's nothing nefarious in there, other than I think it makes good sense for us to switch some of those projects over. Your second question regarding the sale or the proposed -- the exploring, if you will, I want to be clear on that, us exploring whether there's a market for those 5 gas assets. First and foremost, that really has to do with how they strategically fit into our portfolio. Those assets are great assets. We love all of our assets, as Jim Robo always like to say. But in this time, when we are seeing what's happening with other sales out there, it makes a lot of sense for us to explore these. We would absolutely, in our view, have a large taxable gain associated with the sale of these assets. A large taxable gain would be something that we would be able to use our deferred production tax credits to offset, I would say, significantly. A good rule of thumb is you can offset 75% of your taxable gain with production tax credits and we certainly have -- would have enough production tax credits to be able to reduce that gain.
Steven Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch: Okay. That's great. I'd rather have -- just on the first point, rather have the long-term PTC credits expanded as many CITCs. So for good reason too, so okay.
Lewis Hay: Steve, let me just add one thing. These were projects that had great returns with CITC. But because of the technology and the amount of wind energy being produced, even with a deferral using the PTCs, the economics are that much better.
Steven Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch: Are the capacity factors just getting so much better on the new turbines?
Lewis Hay: Yes, basically. I mean good wind resource and that gives us good capacity factors, but the technology gives us even better capacity factors. And as we've said several times before, the capital costs are quite attractive. So that combination just makes the PTC scenario economically superior to the CITC scenario.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Jay Dobson with Wunderlich Securities.
James Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc.: Armando, on the better earnings guidance you're providing for '11, I knew you mentioned it was solely related to the lower depreciation from longer estimated useful lives. But it did change, as you indicated, the CITC election, and I agree with Steve. I like the PTCs better. But how would you have us think about the $0.10 benefit versus the $0.08 drag? Is there some underlying optimism you hold in the business? Or maybe help us understand what you're trying to say there.
Armando Pimentel: I think -- not I think, but the only thing you should be focusing on for that $0.10 increase, because I tried to be clear in my prepared remarks, was the change in depreciation. You brought up a point about the change in CITCs, I just want to kind of clear that up. We had a range of 400 to 550 in our plan. And I said in the first quarter that we've taken -- that we're assuming 275 for the year but really a range of 275 to 375. You should assume -- well, I will tell you, it would be a good assumption for you to assume that our previous estimates had the lower end of the 400 to 550 megawatts of CITC. So the difference between 400 and a 275 to 375 range is really not that significant. So bottom line is, as I tried to say in my prepared remarks, the range is going up solely as a result of the change in the depreciation, and we wanted to be very transparent on that.
James Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc.: That's great. Thanks for the clarity. On the Spanish Solar LLC [ph], what exactly is your exposure? Could you sort of rough that out for us?
Armando Pimentel: I'm not going to be able to give you, Jay, a number. One of the things that was important for us to get done in our Spanish project was -- we're always very comfortable that when we enter into a construction project that we cannot ultimately get it done on time and on budget, but when we get it done, it actually works the way it was designed to work initially. Those are the types of risks that we take on in any project and we have those risks in Spain, and we feel very comfortable with those. One of the risks that we have not taken in the past is what I'll call -- this is probably too long of a title -- but feed-in tariff country credit risk. And this isn't to imply that I'm at all concerned with Spanish sovereign credit, but it is something new for us. And what we wanted to do in this transaction was limit the exposure that we would have, that our equity would have, to a potential change in that feed-in tariff during the construction cycle of the project. Now before I go on, let me first say, we certainly don't expect any changes in the tariff. We believe it's a great tariff. We believe that the government and industry over there has done a great job of putting something together that should be good for Spain itself and for the utilities and for the Spanish people for a very long period of time, but we're a little risk-averse on that. And so the structure we put together allows us to limit our exposure to our equity investment, which will be roughly $250 million or so, plus some amount. And the plus some amount gets complicated, and I'm not going to go into it on the call. But the $250 million or so plus this additional amount is far lower than our expected construction cost, overall construction cost in Spain, which should be over USD $1 billion.
James Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc.: That's great, and I appreciate the clarity. And then last thing on the growth rate, I didn't quite follow where you were taking us. I see the 5% to 7%. I see it's off a new base here. But then you added in the end, if you had no renewable growth, you still expected the 5% to 7%. Is that to say you expect less growth in Energy Resources? Or is that -- how should we interpret the metric you're offering there?
Armando Pimentel: No, it's -- I'm certainly not saying the latter. It's something that we've actually said before, but I'm not sure it's been picked up. I said it for the first time back in our investor conference in May of 2011. I do not recall my exact words, but I said something to the effect that even if Energy Resources wind build gets cut back significantly from the estimates that we provide here today, which is back in May 2010, we would expect to continue to meet our 5% to 7% guidance. It's really a repeat of what I said in May 2010. Our wind projects are great projects. They're very accretive to us. During the first couple of years though, it isn't significant accretion to really change, in this case, the 5% to 7% materially. So I'm not -- this isn't a red herring, if you will. This is just -- I'm just reemphasizing something I said in May 2010. I will add, there's nothing that we see today that would prevent us, with the appropriate public policy, from building a 700 to 1,000 megawatts of wind in 2013 and 2014 as we've said that before. But it's really something that some investors have been asking about, with a concern about wind policy expiring at the end of 2012. So it's really just a repeat of what I said about a year ago.
Lewis Hay: So simply put, Jay, we have enough other growth opportunities that even if the downside scenario that Armando described earlier about less wind development, we can still achieve the 5% to 7% growth that we're talking about. That's all we're saying.
James Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc.: That's perfect.
Operator: We'll take our last question from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates: Thanks for the up-front transparency on the wind turbines stuff, but I was just wondering, what was the previous life expectancy of the unit?
Armando Pimentel: It's from 25 to 30 years.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates: Okay. And is there a specific thing that you guys are doing that's enhancing it? Is it some maintenance item? Or is this just something that you think is sort of an industry-wide thing?
Armando Pimentel: I think it's a combination. First of all, we do most of our own maintenance. That's not something that's done across the industry, but -- so I think we got to take a little credit for that. But secondly, certainly, the technology of these wind turbines have been improving year in and year out. When you combine both of those with our actual experience -- and we've been looking at this for quite a while. When you combine that with our actual experience, we think that the new 30-year life is in the middle of an expected range.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates: Okay. Is there specific technology, like a specific manufacturer, that you'd say is kind of responsible for this? Or is this again just something that you're seeing with all the manufacturers?
Armando Pimentel: We don't buy from everybody, Paul. I can assure that.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates: I do know that. I'm sorry.
Armando Pimentel: Yes. And so I wouldn't say we did it to some and didn't do it to others. But I will add that I said newer wind turbines. Those are really the 1-megawatt machines and above. And we still have some machines that are less than 1-megawatt in our portfolio that we did not change the useful life for.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates: Okay. And then just on the new investment on Slide 20. That seemed to be -- your projections there for 2012 seemed to be coming down and I was wondering what was causing that.
Armando Pimentel: Like always, on these gross margin slides for 2012, there's always puts and takes. I think the first thing to remember, which I have to repeat every time we talk to this, talk about the next year out on the slide, there are no new investments in these slides. So whatever we expect to build in 2012 has not yet been incorporated into the gross margins slide, so it's important for everybody to realize that. The biggest change -- there's roughly a $60 million or so reduction in the gross margin from the midpoint. The biggest change is actually a couple of projects that we have moved from 2011 to 2012, so they were going to have a full year of earnings in 2012 because we got them in 2011. Now that they've been moved back to 2012, there's very little earnings associated with those projects because we haven't included new investments in the 2012 slides. That's the majority of it. There's a couple of puts and takes, but that's more than 80% of it.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Mark Burnett with Morningstar.
Mark Burnett: A couple of quick questions. I noticed the usage in Florida down a little bit over 6%. I'm wondering what your guidance for the year sort of assumes continuing from that little bit of a slide in the first quarter?
Armando Pimentel: The 6%, Mark, is virtually all related to weather. If you look at the heating degree days -- and we provide this actually in the earnings release. If you don't have a copy of it yet, you can get it from our website. But heating degree days for the first quarter of 2011 were about 229, normal is about 256. But last year's first quarter was 587, so more than double of what we had this year. And so, as I mentioned on the call, virtually all of the reduction is related to weather. In terms of customer growth and I'd say usage, regular usage or nonweather-related usage combined, we were pretty close to what we believed we would be doing in the first quarter.
Mark Burnett: Yes, I've seen the slides and whatnot. I'm just trying to get an idea for what you're expecting for the remainder of the year.
Armando Pimentel: For customer growth, we came in at 0.7% for the quarter, and that's actually our estimate for the year.
Mark Burnett: Okay. Second question, I guess, I know you don't want to talk too much about it, but obviously, lots of deals. Nat gas plants, you're looking at your portfolio. Can you talk about some of the fundamentals driving this activity and maybe what you're considering when you're looking at putting those plants up?
Armando Pimentel: Yes. Well, the first thing that we actually considered was just a strategic view of the plant and the territories that we're in. For the most part, not in every part, but for the most part, these plants are in regions that we don't have a whole bunch of assets in. Again, not for all of them, but for the most part. Secondly, we've certainly been seeing activity out in the market. Some of that activity has been attractive and we thought it would be the right time to explore the opportunity to sell those assets. But it started with our view that those were not necessarily strategic assets for us. And once we made that determination, it was really a matter of how many plants do you put into a potential sale portfolio.
Operator: And our last question will be a follow-up question from Steve Fleishman.
Steven Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch: Your commentary on RFPs was a lot more bullish than we've heard in a while. Could you just give a little bit of color on what's going on in the market? What are the dynamics?
Armando Pimentel: A couple of things, Steve. One, I think as I've said before, one of the things that I personally believe would drive additional RFPs and additional requests was an improvement in the economy, improvement in load growth, and we've seen that. We've clearly seen that. We showed slides in the past. And so I think some of the utility companies are feeling a little bit more comfortable about long-term power purchase agreement. That's one. Secondly is we've seen a confluence of events here in, I'd say, the last 6 to 9 months, and that confluence of events we talked about a little bit before, which is really the reduction in capital costs and the improvement in technology. I mean, we're going from 80-meter tower, 80-meter blades to 100-meter tower, 100-meter blades. You're improving the wind capture, the production, if you will, by 20% to 30%. At the same time, you are seeing and we are seeing turbine cost from 2008 compared today roughly down 20%. If you put both of those things together, along with the improvement that folks are seeing in load and the economy, I think that's what we're seeing. There are more people coming to ask, "What about wind? What about wind?" It continues to be the most economical renewable, in our view. So I think it's that combination.
James Robo: Steve, this is Jim. I'd just add that it's not just RFPs. In fact, we are proactively going out and talking to all our customers in the wind space and letting them know that this is an unprecedented time for them to be able to buy wind very attractively. And it hasn't been this attractive in certainly more than 5 or 6 years from our customer's standpoint. And so we are proactively going out and getting a lot of traction with our customers around just talking about how attractive a time it is if you combine that with the uncertainty in the post-2012 in the wind federal incentive regime, and that combination of factors is leading folks to really start to step up in a bigger way than we've seen in quite some time.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our question-and-answer session today. I would like to thank you all for your participation in today's call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2010 Q4  (2011-01-25 09:00:00) =====
Executives: Armando Pimentel - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Finance James Robo - President and Chief Operating Officer Lewis Hay - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Chairman of Executive Committee, Chairman of FPL Energy LLC and Chairman of Florida Power & Light Company Rebecca Kujawa - 
Analysts: Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Dan Eggers - Crédit Suisse AG Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC Hasan Doza - Luminus Management James Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc. Steven Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the NextEra Energy, Incorporated, Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2010 Earnings Release Conference. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Ms. Rebecca Kujawa. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Rebecca Kujawa: Thank you, April. Good morning, everyone, and welcomed to our fourth quarter and full year 2010 earnings conference call. Lew Hay, NextEra Energy's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of NextEra Energy's performance and recent accomplishments. Lew will be followed by Armando Pimentel, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss the specifics of our financial results. Also joining us this morning are Jim Robo, President and Chief Operating Officer of NextEra Energy; Armando Olivera, President and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light; and Mitch Davidson, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources, which we will refer to as Energy Resources in this presentation. Following our prepared remarks, our senior management team will be available to take your questions. We will be making statements during this call that are forward looking. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements. If any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call in the Risk Factors section of our accompanying presentation or in the latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found on the Investors section of our website, www.nexteraenergy.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. Please also note that today's presentation includes references to adjusted earnings, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying this presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of the non-GAAP measure to the closest GAAP financial measure. With that, I will turn the call over to Lew Hay. Lew?
Lewis Hay: Okay. Thanks, Rebecca. Good morning, everyone. In both the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2010, NextEra Energy achieved strong financial results. For the quarter, we earned adjusted earnings of $332 million or $0.80 per share. And for the full year, we earned record adjusted earnings of $1.8 billion or $4.30 per share. Even though last year was one of the most challenging business environments we've ever faced, NextEra Energy was able to grow adjusted earnings per share by 6%, right at the midpoint of our long-term adjusted EPS growth expectations of 5% to 7% per year on average through 2014, starting from a 2009 base. In addition, when measured over the long term, we continue to provide a strong track record of outperformance when compared with our peers in the overall market. For the five years ending on December 31, 2010, we delivered a total shareholder return of 48%, easily outpacing both the S&P 500's 12% and the S&P Electric Utilities' 20%.  Over 10 years, our performance is even more impressive with a total return of 107% compared to 15% for the S&P 500 and 57% for the S&P Electric Utilities.  Now one of the keys to our success over the long term has been our commitment to financial strength. This commitment allowed us to raise $3.7 billion in debt, of which $1.2 billion is project debt, at attractive rates in 2010. We also issued $711 million in equity and equity units to support our strong credit position and to enable us to invest wisely in the future. You've often heard me say that one of the features that sets NextEra Energy apart is the fact that we have two great businesses under one roof. The wisdom of that strategy was clearly evident last year. In 2010, as challenging market conditions limited the growth of Energy Resources' adjusted earnings, FPL once again became the largest driver of NextEra Energy's adjusted earnings growth. Something that we expect to continue through at least 2014. The rate settlement approved by the Florida Public Service Commission in December will effectively freeze base rates through 2012, provide cash recovery for our new combined-cycle natural gas unit at FPL's West County Energy Center and provide the company with an allowed retail regulatory return on equity or ROE of 9% to 11%. The settlement agreement provides financial certainty to customers and regulatory certainty to FPL. And we appreciate the willingness of those who represent Florida's electric consumers to work with us on a constructive outcome. We believe FPL's retail regulatory ROE will be at or near 11% in 2011 and 2012. Over the four-year period from 2011 through 2014, FPL plans to bring into service major capital projects that cost approximately $6.4 billion, from combined-cycle natural gas plants to nuclear uprates to the Smart Grid. Not only do we expect our overall retail base rate to expand at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 8.5% through 2014 from a 2009 base, but we also expect to earn an appropriate return on our investments over time while continuing to provide great value to our customers. In December, we brought online a 75-megawatt solar thermal array that is fully integrated with and augments the steam produced by our combined-cycle gas unit in Martin County. This represents the last of the original 110 megawatts of solar projects approved for clause recovery in 2008 by the Florida Public Service Commission. As with all of the projects in our Florida pipeline over the past few years, we completed the Martin solar thermal array on schedule and under budget. NextEra Energy's strong financial performance is matched by the company's ability to consistently achieve high levels of operational performance. In 2010, FPL's fossil fuel fleet set another record for its efficiency, bringing the system-wide heat rate down to 8,043 British thermal units per kilowatt hour. The average heat rate for the industry was 10,060 British thermal units per kilowatt hour for 2009, the most recent year for which data are available. Since 2001, FPL's heat rate has improved by 17%. And in 2010 alone, we saved customers more than $600 million in fuel costs as a result.  Just as important have been our efforts to prudently manage costs. For all of 2010, FPL's non-fuel O&M expenses were $0.015 per kilowatt hour compared with the 2009 industry average of $0.022 per kilowatt hour. On service reliability, the company's System Average Interruption Duration Index or SAIDI was again top quartile in the industry.  At Energy Resources, we added 754 megawatts of wind capacity in North America in 2010, including 70 megawatts from acquisitions. At the end of the year, we owned 8,298 megawatts of wind power. Not only are we the leading wind energy owner in the United States, but we are now the fourth largest wind energy owner in Canada.  We also made considerable progress in 2010 signing power purchase agreements for the production of our wind fleet. All told, we secured long-term contracts on approximately 1,238 megawatts of wind power during the year. And although not all of these contracts were for 2010 construction projects, we're happy with the progress in this area. On the solar front, the PPA for our Genesis project was approved by the California Public Utility Commission, Bureau of Land Management and the California Energy Commission in 2010. Site work started this month. And we plan for the project's twin 125-megawatt arrays to qualify for the convertible investment tax credit or CITC in 2013 and 2014, respectively.  Our Spain solar project also made progress in 2010. In December, the Spanish government published its revised feed-in tariff. As we had expected, the net effect of the changes contained in the revised Royal Decree were roughly neutral to our project, and we remain interested in moving forward.  Energy Resources now has a talented team in place on the ground to work with the banks, government officials and other parties to manage our interests. Armando will provide a more detailed update on Spain in a couple of minutes. Combined, the full construction of the Genesis and Spain solar projects would represent an approximately $2.3 billion investment in solar. And we expect them to be significant earnings drivers for the company starting in the 2013-2014 time frame. From an operational standpoint, Energy Resources' fleet of power generating assets performed exceptionally well during 2010, setting a high mark with its lowest forced outage rate on record. In addition to growth at FPL and Energy Resources, we expect to grow earnings through Lone Star Transmission, our regulated utility in Texas. Lone Star received approval in late 2010 to build a roughly 320-mile, approximately $800 million transmission line. The company is eligible to earn an allowance for funds used during construction in 2011, and the project is expected to be in service in 2013. Record adjusted earnings, solid earnings growth, strong operational performance and the continued development of an attractive pipeline of capital projects, this was NextEra Energy's story in 2010, and we expect it will be our story going forward as well. On that note, let me turn the call over to Armando Pimentel before I return for a few final remarks. Armando?
Armando Pimentel: Thank you, Lew, and good morning to everyone. In the fourth quarter 2010, NextEra Energy's GAAP net income was $263 million or $0.63 per share. NextEra Energy's 2010 fourth quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $332 million and $0.80, respectively. The difference between the GAAP and adjusted results is the exclusion of the mark in our non-qualifying hedge category and the exclusion of net other than temporary impairments on certain investments or OTTI. For the full year 2010, NextEra Energy's GAAP net income was $2 billion or $4.74 per share. NextEra Energy's adjusted 2010 earnings and EPS were $1.8 billion and $4.30, respectively.  For the fourth quarter of 2010, Florida Power & Light had net income of $181 million or $0.43 per share. For the full year 2010, FPL's net income was $945 million or $2.29 per share. The table shown here summarizes the earnings drivers for FPL for the just completed quarter as well as for the full year 2010. In total, quarterly earnings decreased by $0.02 per share. The decrease was primarily driven by the impact of weather and increased O&M expenses. These drivers were partially offset by the impact of FPL's base rate increase and increased results from clauses, including the shifting of certain capacity charges from base rates in the capacity clause. Full year 2010 results were driven by the addition of West County units 1 and 2 and the impact of FPL's base rate revenue increases in clause results, partially offset by higher O&M, depreciation expense as a result of the settlement agreement and AFUDC. We are continuing to see improvement in some of our key customer metrics, although they are not yet all trending positively. The table in the upper left shows the change in retail kilowatt-hour sales in the quarter versus last year's comparable period. Overall, retail kilowatt hour sales fell by 3.5%, a decline due primarily to lower weather-related usage and partially offset by an increase in customer growth. Although many of you are aware that we experienced a far colder-than-normal month in December, the weather for the quarter as a whole, particularly cooling degree days, was mild relative to normal and well below the favorable weather realized in the fourth quarter of 2009.  Non-weather-related or underlying usage and all other declined by 0.9%. Although some of this decrease continues to be due to mandated energy efficiency measures, I think that some is related to the impact of empty home that I will discuss in a moment, and some is also related to the effects of extreme weather that are not precisely covered in our models. Over the last 60 years, December 2010 was the coldest December on record and the fifth coldest winter month overall for our service territory. And again, our total system performed admirably during this last cold weather event, just as it did during last January's record cold temperatures. As depicted in the graph in the upper right-hand corner, during the fourth quarter of 2010 we had approximately 28,000 more customers than we did in the comparable period of 2009. This is the fourth quarter in a row where we have had customer increases compared to the prior comparable period, and we continue to be cautiously optimistic that our customer growth is returning. The graph on the bottom left shows our monthly year-over-year customer additions in percentage terms, broken down by residential and commercial customers. As you can see, residential customer additions accelerated at the beginning of 2010, then the growth held roughly steady through the balance of the year. Trends in commercial customer growth appear to lag that of the residential customers, and it was not until the summer months of 2010 that commercial growth accelerated. The coming year will be important for the Florida economy, and we will continue to monitor customer trends carefully in the next couple of months. The graph on the bottom right of the page shows inactive and low-usage customers, which we believe depict the level of empty homes in our service territory. In December 2010, the decline in residential inactive meters accelerated, while the ratio of inactive meters to total accounts experienced its largest drop since February 2010. However, despite the decline in inactive meters, low-usage customers increased slightly. While we cannot be certain, we believe it is possible that a certain number of inactive accounts are turning into low-usage accounts.  To my earlier comments on sales growth, some of the customer growth we are experiencing may not yet be producing sales and, in our analysis, may be contributing to the negative underlying usage. The current environment might be viewed as a transition period as Florida is working through the effects of the real estate market downturn over the last couple of years. On the positive side, homes in FPL markets are becoming more affordable. For example, the current housing affordability index for Miami is now 66% versus 72% for the U.S. and compared to 11% at the peak of the boom in late 2006. Traditionally, housing affordability has been one of Florida's advantages. And we believe Florida will continue to be a very attractive destination to which people and industry will move.  Because of the impact of -- the base rate agreement will have on FPL's earnings over the next couple of years, I would like to spend a couple of minutes reviewing the details of the agreement in general and the amortization of surplus depreciation in particular.  Under the terms of the agreement, retail base rates will remain effectively frozen through the end of 2012. And through the capacity clause, FPL is permitted to recover the costs, including return, for its new combined-cycle natural gas unit at West County Energy Center up to the projected fuel savings for customers attributed to the new unit. This allows for current cash recovery without a corresponding increase in customers' total bill. The estimated 2011 fuel savings is approximately $96 million, which is roughly equal to the non-fuel revenue requirements for the plant at a 10% ROE. The authorized retail regulatory ROE remains within the range of 9% to 11%, and is measured on an actual non-weather-adjusted basis. I will refer to the actual non-weather adjusted retail regulatory ROE in this discussion as just retail regulatory ROE. As you recall, as part of the rate order issued in March 2010, the Commission determined that FPL had $895 million in net surplus depreciation and ordered FPL to amortize its surplus depreciation ratably over a four-year period starting in 2010.  Under the agreement, FPL has the flexibility to vary the quarterly and annual amount of surplus depreciation amortization that it records. The surplus depreciation will be amortized to keep FPL's earned regulatory ROE within the approved range of up to 11%, subject to certain annual and total caps.  A $267 million annual cap on the amortization of surplus depreciation applies to each year of the agreement. However, to the extent that our amortization of surplus in any given year is less than the $267 million cap, it can be carried forward and will be available for use in subsequent years. In essence, raising subsequent years' caps. No more than $776 million of the surplus depreciation can be amortized during the term of the agreement, unless more, up to the entire amount of the initial $895 million of surplus depreciation then remaining, is required to avoid a filing with the PSC showing a retail regulatory ROE of less than 9%. In any year of the agreement, the company must amortize enough of the surplus depreciation to maintain at least 9% retail regulatory ROE, but may not amortize any surplus depreciation if the amortization would result in FPL earning above an 11% retail regulatory ROE. We have prepared this summary to assist you in understanding how the surplus depreciation might be amortized over the term of the agreement. As a result of favorable weather during 2010, we amortized approximately $4 million of the allowed $267 million for the year. The amount below the annual cap that we did not amortize in 2010, or $263 million, will be available for use in 2011, bringing the total allowed amortization of surplus depreciation in 2011 to be approximately $530 million.  Based on current estimates and making certain assumptions, including normal weather and operating conditions, we believe we will amortize between $245 million and $265 million of surplus depreciation in 2011. Assuming those estimates are correct, that would leave between $507 million and $527 million of surplus depreciation available to be amortized in 2012 in order to achieve a retail regulatory ROE at or near 11%. Based on current estimates, we expect FPL will earn a retail regulatory ROE at or near 11% in both 2011 and 2012. On a book basis, the overall FPL ROE would be less than 11% because there are some expenses not recoverable through rates and some clause investments that earn a 10% ROE.  As Lew mentioned, we expect FPL's retail rate base to grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 8.5%, from a 2009 base through 2014. This growth is being driven by approximately $6.4 billion of major capital projects, including modernizations and nuclear uprates, expected to be brought into service between 2011 and 2014. All of which have been approved by the Commission and several of which will receive clause recovery. As you recall, we manage our equity ratio on a GAAP basis to approximately 59%, which currently translates to a regulatory equity ratio of roughly 48%. It is strong rate-based growth, coupled with a fair and appropriate return on these investments, which we expect to be the significant driver of NextEra Energy's overall growth.  As many of you know, last year the Florida legislature considered legislation that would have given utilities the voluntary opportunity to build renewable generation in the state and would have provided costs recovery through a clause mechanism. If legislation is enacted in the future, FPL would have the opportunity to build incremental renewable generation that is not in our current plans. Let me now turn to Energy Resources. During 2010, we successfully added 754 megawatts of incremental wind capacity to our portfolio, including 70 megawatts of existing wind generation that we acquired during the fourth quarter. Of note, our 82 megawatt Ghost Pine Canada wind project was the largest wind generation facility brought into service in 2010 in Canada. And we now own and operate approximately 220 megawatts of wind generation in the country. We are pleased that in the fourth quarter, we secured approximately 454 megawatts in wind purchase power agreements or PPAs. This figure includes 78 megawatts related to a PPA we signed for a repowering project in California. We will talk more about the current wind generation contracting environment in a couple of minutes. During the course of 2010, we elected to receive CITCs on 603 megawatts of new wind generation. During the calendar year of 2010, we received approximately $430 million in cash related to the program, and we expect to receive roughly $400 million in cash in 2011. As we initially indicated on the third quarter earnings conference call, we continue to expect to elect CITCs on 400 to 550 megawatts of new wind generation in 2011. Turning to our solar initiatives. We have also continued to make significant progress on our solar development pipeline. During the fourth quarter, we acquired appropriately 40 megawatts of solar projects currently in development in Ontario, Canada. Construction on the projects is expected to begin in early 2011, and commercial operations are expected by the end of 2011. The projects, when completed, will sell power under a long-term contract to the Ontario Power Authority. We also commissioned the 5-megawatt Paradise solar PV project in New Jersey. The Paradise project generates New Jersey's solar renewable energy credits.  In November, the Genesis solar thermal project received approval from the Bureau of Land Management, the last major approval the project needed before site work began this month. And although we do not have anything to announce at this time, we are optimistic about our ability to sign incremental PPAs in California and adjacent states for large-scale solar generation.  We are pleased to highlight that our Duane Arnold Energy Center received a 20-year license extension from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission or NRC. The NRC approval comes just after two years after NextEra Energy Duane Arnold and its joint owners entered the extremely rigorous and comprehensive license extension process managed by the NRC.  Finally, we have two financing transactions we would like to highlight. First, during the fourth quarter, we entered into two CAD $150 million three-year variable rate revolving credit facilities that expire at the end of 2013. These facilities are particularly attractive because they are in Canadian dollars, which align well with investments we are making in the country. Second, in December, we successfully financed our 507-megawatt gas-fired facility located in Blythe, California. We were able to secure a $231 million limited recourse loan as a result of proactively seeking a long-term power sales agreement for the output of the plant.  Energy Resources reported fourth quarter 2010 GAAP earnings of $73 million or $0.17 per share. Adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter, which exclude the effect of non-qualifying hedges and net OTTI, were $143 million or $0.34 per share. For the full year 2010, Energy Resources reported GAAP earnings of $980 million or $2.37 per share. Adjusted earnings were $800 million or $1.93 per share.  As we mentioned in the first quarter of 2010, we have changed the methodology for allocating interest and shared costs to affiliates. And historical figures on this slide have been adjusted to reflect that change. Energy Resources' fourth quarter adjusted EPS increased $0.02 from last year's comparable quarter. New wind and solar investment contributions were relatively flat due to the $0.04 lower contribution from CITCs. This was largely offset by the $0.03 contribution from assets placed into service in the fourth quarter of 2009 that were available for a full quarter in 2010. We elected to take CITCs on 603 megawatts of new wind generation placed in service in 2010 compared with 815 megawatts in 2009. In aggregate, the existing asset portfolio contributed $0.15 relative to the prior year. Existing wind assets contributed approximately $0.04 per share as compared to the year-ago period, which was largely due to an improved wind resource. The wind resource was approximately 92% of normal, which was an improvement relative to the prior year's quarter of 81%. Within our existing merchant assets, the lack of an extended outage at our Seabrook nuclear facility in 2010 fourth quarter contributed $0.16. This was partially offset by weak market conditions affecting our merchant Texas gas assets, which resulted in $0.03 lower adjusted earnings per share.  Within our contracted assets, a positive $0.02 contribution from the lack of a refueling outage at our Point Beach nuclear facility in 2010 was substantially offset by a negative $0.02 contribution from Marcus Hook 750, which was largely due to unfavorable market conditions and a scheduled outage.  Contributions from the Customer Supply business declined $0.02. Contributions from proprietary trading declined by $0.03 per share. As we've indicated before, results from Customer Supply and trading will often be higher or lower than we expect based on a number of factors, including market volatility and opportunities. As we noted in last year's fourth quarter earnings report, market conditions were particularly favorable in both the fourth quarter and full year 2009. Restructuring and asset sales contributed a negative $0.01 compared to last year due to the absence of a gain recorded last year. During the quarter, we wrote down the value of certain assets associated with our plants that repower two wind facilities. The write-offs negatively impacted adjusted EPS by $0.03. Although we have included the impact of the write-offs in adjusted earnings, we wanted to highlight them separately so investors understand these are not part of ongoing operations. All other factors contributed negative $0.04 per share, primarily due to higher interest expense. For the full year 2010, adjusted earnings per share decreased by $0.01. New wind and solar additions contributed $0.11, which was driven primarily by the full year adjusted earnings impact from 2009 wind additions and the benefit of state income tax credits, partially offset by the impact of lower CITC elections in 2010 relative to 2009. In aggregate, the existing asset portfolio contributed $0.13 relative to the prior year. For the full year, the contribution from existing wind assets declined $0.02 due to unfavorable pricing of ERCOT wind and the lack of certain state tax credits in 2010, which were substantially offset by lower curtailment and an increased wind resource. Performance from our existing merchant NEPOOL assets was higher by $0.20, driven primarily by the lack of an extended outage at our Seabrook nuclear facility. Contributions from our merchant gas assets in Texas were lower by $0.07 due to unfavorable market conditions. Gas infrastructure contributions were up $0.06 relative to the prior year, largely due to the closing out of certain hedges in the third quarter.  The Customer Supply business contributed $0.10 due to a strong Full Requirements business as well as GEXA retail and mid-marketing origination contributions. Within Full Requirements, the sale of a power supply contract in the first quarter, new contracts and favorable market conditions contributed to the strong results for the year. The proprietary Power and Gas Trading business contributed a negative $0.16 due to unfavorable market conditions relative to last year's very favorable market conditions. Asset sales contributed a positive $0.02, while the write-offs taken in the fourth quarter related to the California wind assets contributed a negative $0.03. All other factors contributed a negative $0.24, of which $0.13 was from higher interest expense and share dilution, and the balance is largely related to the lack of favorable tax benefits in 2010 relative to 2009. We remain interested in developing or acquiring new wind generation projects and believe that our economy and our environment will benefit from continued investments, including generation. We're also committed to maintaining our financial discipline. Therefore, the amount of new wind we ultimately add to our portfolio will largely depend upon our ability to secure attractive long-term PPAs.  As Lew mentioned a couple of minutes ago, during the fourth quarter we secured approximately 454 megawatts in wind PPAs, bringing our total wind PPAs signed in 2010 to 1,238 megawatts. As of year-end 2010, we have 612 megawatts of wind capacity that is built and we intend to contract, but currently do not have a signed long-term agreement in hand. Contracting these megawatts continues to be a high priority for us, and I am comfortable with the progress that we are making.  As noted in the chart on the right, of the total 1,238 megawatts of PPAs secured in 2010, 553 megawatts are for projects we expect to be commissioned in 2011. As always, some of these projects could slip into 2012 due to normal development and construction timing issues. In addition to the 553 megawatts of secured contracts, we have another 400 to 500 megawatts of projects currently in development, but without contracts, that could be commissioned in 2011. This level of certainty regarding contracts for the pipeline is particularly positive, given the challenging conditions we continue to encounter in the market. One way that we plan to add incremental value to the business in the next couple of years is to begin to repower some of our older wind facilities. We can deploy fewer wind turbines with an increased net capacity factor and also take advantage of new elections of either the production tax credit, or PTCs, or the CITC. In fact during in the fourth quarter, we signed a PPA with an existing California facilities off-taker to repower that facility. We believe we may have the opportunity to repower approximately 300 to 400 megawatts of wind capacity over the next four years. As we have indicated to you many times and our track record should show, we are as interested in acquiring new and existing wind and solar assets as we are in building them ourselves. In fact, we have acquired approximately 343 megawatts of renewable generation assets since 2008. This does not include 190 megawatts of wind and solar projects purchased or contracted to purchase in the fourth quarter of 2010 that are expected to come online in mid-2011. As we have indicated over the past 12 to 18 months, we have expected a number of assets to change hands, but the executed transactions have been fewer than we would have predicted. You should expect that when large assets or portions of assets come into the market, we will take a look at most, if not all of these opportunities and pursue the ones that fit into our portfolio and our strategic plans. As Lew, mentioned in December, the changes to the Royal Decree that we first mentioned during the second quarter earnings conference call were officially approved and incorporated into a revised Royal Decree. As a reminder, the Spain projects consist of two 49.9-megawatt solar thermal projects with molten salt storage. Under the current tariff, the projects will receive a government guaranteed premium tariff rate over their operating lives, which we estimate will be approximately 30 years.  We are now working to finalize the financing for the projects that should provide the bulk of the funding for construction through the projects' commercial operations. While the financing has not been finalized, we are currently engaged with several European banks on a financing package that would provide the bulk of the necessary cash flows for construction and limit our exposure in the event of a change in the tariff to the amount of our equity investment.  We began site work in January and expect the two units to reach commercial operations in 2013. The projects in Spain are a high priority for our development team, and are the only significant development or acquisition opportunity we are pursuing outside North America. We continue to believe the risk-adjusted returns are attractive and the projects represent a strategic opportunity for us to further build our skills in solar and expand our Solar Generation portfolio. We have a team permanently on the ground in Spain that is monitoring and managing all the developments that affect our projects. We monitor carefully the financial, economic and political developments in the country. And our team is engaged with the banks, local industry, government officials and other interested parties to manage and support our interests. Our overall Energy Resources projects gross margin and EBITDA expectations for 2011 and 2012 have not changed significantly since we reviewed them with you last quarter. The full gross margin hedge slides can be found in the appendix of this presentation, which is posted to our website.  In 2011, the average hedge price for our non-spark spread merchant assets in terms of dollars per MMBtu of natural gas is $6.97, and the average hedge price in 2012 is $6.36. These prices are clearly above current market prices and highlight the effectiveness of our hedging program. In addition to incremental detail about 2011 and 2012, we wanted to give you a little perspective on the visibility we have on Energy Resources business in 2014. Predominantly, as a result of our portfolio of long-term contracted assets, approximately 69% of our existing power assets' expected gross margin is currently hedged in 2014.  Regarding earnings sensitivities, the adjusted EPS sensitivity to changes in natural gas prices on our 2011 open positions is relatively modest. For every $1 per MMBtu change in gas prices, the annualized impact is approximately $0.03 per share on an adjusted earnings basis at NextEra Energy, Inc. For 2012, the equivalent adjusted earnings sensitivity is $0.06 per share. We also want to update the sensitivity regarding the wind resource for assets and service as of January 1, 2011. For every 1% change in the wind resource on an annual basis, adjusted EPS at NextEra Energy, Inc., would be impacted approximately $0.02 per share.  To summarize 2010's fourth quarter results on an adjusted basis, FPL contributed $0.43, Energy Resources contributed $0.34 and Corporate and Other was a positive $0.03 contribution. That is a total of $0.80 per share compared to $0.79 per share in the fourth quarter of 2009 or a 1% increase year-over-year. On an adjusted basis for the full year 2010, FPL contributed $2.29 per share, Energy Resources contributed $1.93 and Corporate and Other was a positive $0.08 contribution. That is a total $4.30 compared to $4.05 per share in 2009 or a 6% increase year-over-year.  Before turning the call back over to Lew, I wanted to spend just a minute discussing our long-term adjusted earnings per share guidance. Back at our May 2010 Investor Conference, when we first discussed our longer-term expectations, I indicated that primarily because of the significance of our current construction cycle at FPL, adjusted earnings per share growth through 2014 would be driven largely by FPL investments. That continues to remain true, and we should not forget about the value that our investments are bringing to our Florida customers. Our typical residential electric bill remains the lowest in Florida, and 24% below the national average. And we estimate that by 2014, our continuing investments and more efficient generation will save our customers roughly $1 billion per year relative to a 2001 base. We continue to believe that a laser-sharp focus on doing what is best for our customers will result in positive outcomes for our shareholders as well.  And so by 2014, our expectations are that a majority of our consolidated adjusted earnings will be from the regulated side of our business, including our investments in Lone Star Transmission. We believe that not only will our regulated adjusted earnings per share make up roughly 60% of our consolidated adjusted earnings, but that on an EBITDA basis, roughly 80% of our forecasted adjusted EBITDA will be from investments that are either regulated or long-term contracted. For 2010, that percentage is approximately 74%.  Of course, that assumes that new renewable investments in our plan through 2014 are long-term contracted. But that is a proper assumption since we are committed to invest in that side of our business only when we expect longer-term certainty in the cash flows from those investments.  So that should give you some additional insight regarding the make-up of our expectations for 5% to 7% adjusted earnings per share growth per year through 2014 from a 2009 base. In 2011, we continue to believe that adjusted EPS within a range of $4.25 and $4.55 is a reasonable expectation. With that, let me turn the call back over to Lew.
Lewis Hay: Thanks, Armando. I want to close by providing some perspective on why we think NextEra Energy remains well positioned for growth.  On the regulated side of our business, we are in the midst of a substantial capital spending program and expect to bring into service projects that cost approximate $7.2 billion between FPL and Lone Star Transmission between now and 2014. In Florida, we will be building new combined-cycle plants, pursuing more than 400 megawatts of added capacity to our nuclear units and continuing the deployment of our Smart Grid program. We plan to spend an approximately $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion on the nuclear uprates, all of which is clause recoverable. We expect to earn an appropriate return on all of these projects, each of which have produced tangible benefits for customers in the form of improved long-term power affordability and reliability. In Texas, our Lone Star Transmission business became a utility in October 2010. We will earn regulated returns on our roughly 320-mile transmission line, even as we help set the stage for a dramatic expansion of wind power in the state.  Energy Resources has a strong pipeline of renewable energy projects that should fuel profitable growth. We remain confident in our ability to grow our wind fleet by 3,500 to 5,000 megawatts through 2014. And the 754 megawatts we added in 2010 were an excellent start.  Equally impressive is the progress we've made on our solar strategy. Of the $3 billion to $4 billion we expect to invest in solar projects between 2010 and 2014, we already have approximately $2.3 billion of projects under contract, and initial site work is underway. We also have a robust pipeline of additional opportunities.  And of course, whenever assets come up for sale, we will be taking a careful look to see if they make sense for us. With our track record of superior execution, we have every confidence that we will be able to bring these planned projects to a successful completion. That's why we remain very comfortable with our view that the business can generate a 5% to 7% average annual increase in adjusted EPS through 2014 from a 2009 base, even as the overall level of risk in our portfolio declines. By 2014, we expect that approximately 80% of NextEra Energy's EBITDA will come from regulated or long-term contracted assets. In closing, I want to thank NextEra Energy's 15,000 employees for their talent and hard work, which allowed us to deliver superior value for customers and shareholders alike in 2010, and will continue to do so in the years ahead. And with that, I'm going to turn the call over to the conference moderator for any questions you might have. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll first hear from Dan Eggers of Credit Suisse.
Dan Eggers - Crédit Suisse AG: Just kind of running with the renewable comments in the investment program, can you just share a little more thoughts on how the returns are looking on some of the acquisition projects you guys have seen this year relative to the self-built projects? And there are targets for wind and solar investment, but how you think about the flexibility of maybe reallocating dollars between technologies as the opportunity shows up?
Armando Pimentel: I think we're -- and we tried to make that clear in the comments, I think we're very open to reallocating the dollars across the board, whether it's towards technology or from self-build to acquisitions, Dan. Your first comment, though, on returns, I'd say it's no different than what we would expect and have been receiving for our self-build projects. And I do believe that, that is one of the reasons -- I talked about this in the script and I've talked about it before. I think that is one of the reasons why we and others haven't seen as much activity as maybe we expected 12 to 18 months ago. I think there's still some hesitation on the other side, on the seller side, to potentially let go of these assets so that the buyers are able to gain the returns that they expect and that make economic sense for them. But on the self-build and acquisition front, I tried to make very clear today in the prepared remarks that we see both opportunity and a pari passu. Our investment dollars will be allocated to those projects that we believe have the strongest long-term returns.
Dan Eggers - Crédit Suisse AG: And then I guess if you could just share some thoughts on the bonus depreciation changes, how you guys anticipate that showing up in cash in '11 and into '12 relative to plan and what that might mean as far as how you're thinking about capital raising requirements for the next two years?
Armando Pimentel: Yes, obviously a big issue for this industry because it's so capital intensive. It's appropriate, though, to start out by saying that the rules are not -- the legislation might be done. This legislation went through rather quickly, as we all know. And now the folks in Washington D.C. that are responsible for actually interpreting that legislation appear to be having difficulty with pieces of it. And so I would first start out by saying that there is more to this bonus depreciation that should be coming out, I would hope, in the next couple of months. And the interpretations that would be particularly important for the industry and for us are interpretations regarding self-build or self-constructed assets. I'm not going to get into details on this call, but I will tell you that those interpretations are still up in the air and would make the difference between some of our assets receiving 100% bonus depreciation and some of our assets receiving 50% bonus depreciation. But the additional cash that's coming in on both sides of the business is not that significant for us overall. But that's because we had a significant amount of production tax credits that were going to offset future taxable income. And we have talked about that before. So it's really an allocation of cash flows between the companies. But on a corporate level, at least for us, based on what I'm seeing today, I wouldn't expect the cash flows to be significantly different from our forecast of 2014.
Dan Eggers - Crédit Suisse AG: On the wind resource availability for 2011, it looks like getting back to normal would add $0.16 or $0.18 if you're at 100%. What sort of utilization assumptions are you guys putting into your numbers for '11 in the guidance right now?
Armando Pimentel: We always assume wind will blow at a P50 level. That's what we've assumed in the past. We've talked about wind resource quite a bit over the last 12 to 18 months. I've spent, what I would say, large amounts of earnings calls really discussing what we do and how we do it and our estimates. And we continue to feel comfortable in the way that we're forecasting wind. Clearly the work that we've done up to this point show that the wind resource for 2009 and for 2010 were very low based on historical standards. A couple of times in the last year, I've mentioned, this is the worst quarter in the last 30 years, and so we should assume that that's not going to continue long term. We certainly don't see any indication that wind resource would be less than our P50 estimates longer term.
Operator: Next we'll hear from Steve Fleishman of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Steven Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch: Just on the wind PPAs, the 1,200 megawatts, that's, my guess is, among the most PPAs you've done in a year. And given the conditions, that where people were concerned about that, it seems to be quite large. Kind of what -- are these all long-term PPAs? And just kind of in what frameworks have you been able to achieve that, even just the 450 megawatts in the fourth quarter? Is this mainly through renewable PPAs or are there other ways you're being able to -- through renewable RFPs or are there other ways you're being able to contract this?
Armando Pimentel: Yes, I don't -- Steve, first of all, if I can get all your questions just kind of in order here. But the 1,243, as far as we know, is the largest amount of PPAs in terms of megawatts that we have signed in a year. So we're pretty happy with that. There's nothing nefarious about that number. They are all long-term contracts. They all are sort of how we'd been doing business in the past. I mean they are bilateral agreements. There are some feed-in tariffs. There are some RFPs. I mean, it's all in there. I can tell you that it has been a laser focus of the company over the last 12 to 18 months to get this done, and we're not done. I mean, we have 600 megawatts or so of uncontracted wind projects that is high priority for us to contract. So I know that we are very, very happy with the team's progress on this during the year, but we expect more. So I wanted to lay it out in the slide, and I think we did a good job of doing that in the presentation, but we shouldn't believe that there was anything different that we did. I mean, we have been spending a whole heck of a lot management time making sure that we get some visibility on this business longer term.
Steven Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch: One other unrelated question, just on the financing plans. If I recall back to your Analyst Meeting last year, you planned to do $1.2 billion of equity over the five years to fund your growth?
Armando Pimentel: Yes.
Steven Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch: And I think you said just in 2010, you did $700 million.
Armando Pimentel: Yes.
Steven Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch: Does that mean there's only about $500 million left or has that $1.2 billion changed?
Armando Pimentel: Let me just -- that $1.2 billion has not changed at this point. We have what I would say is less than $500 million to go. That $1.2 billion could change in the future. But it could change as a result of newer opportunities. It could change as a result of changes in cash flow from operations at either one of our businesses, specifically in 2013 and 2014. We have put a financing plan together that we believe maintains our strong credit and our strong balance sheet. And so we present that, obviously, to the rating agencies every year. I have no expectations at this point that the $1.2 billion that we presented in May would change through 2014. I just don't want to give -- that was an estimate. I don't want to give folks the view that, that could never change, no matter what happens. Clearly changes in cash flows, especially in '13 and '14, could affect that number.
Operator: Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank.
Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG: Armando, could I ask you just to give a little bit more color on maybe the geographic location of some of the uncontracted megawatts and versus where you have managed to contract legacy with wind?
Armando Pimentel: Yes. The contracted PPAs were kind of all across the board: California, Midwest, Canada. I mean we've had, I would say, pretty good results in all of the areas that we had uncontracted plants that I spoke about in the third quarter or that we were constructing. I wouldn't say necessarily that we're having worse results in any one particular area. In terms of the projects that are open and uncontracted, most of those projects would be in the Midwest-type area where we did a lot of development in 2008 and 2009. It's not that we feel uncomfortable longer term about contracting those. I mean, we clearly have identified potential customers and we've identified potential opportunities through RFPs that are coming up. So again, I wouldn't say that, of the 1,238 we signed, we were particularly strong just in region X or region Y. We did well across the board. And with the open ones that we have, I would say that they're mostly in the Midwest. And we feel comfortable that, in a reasonable period of time, that we can find contracts for those.
Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG: And can you hazard a guess as to what your sort of market share of the PPAs signed in the last quarter might have been?
Armando Pimentel: It would be high.
Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG: Okay. I did have one other thing. We noticed, on a different topic, on the portfolio disclosures, there's been a shift between, I think, power and gas trading in favor of Power Supply business, between those buckets, although the numbers at the bottom stayed the same. Can you give us -- $30 million, $40 million or so. Some insight into what happened there?
Armando Pimentel: Yes. I think that's -- Jonathan, that's a continuation of the comments that I made during the third quarter, where I said that we had seen -- up to that point, we had seen less opportunities, both because of prices and volatilities in the proprietary trading business. But on the other hand, we had seen stronger results in what we call our Customer Supply business, which contains both the Full Requirements business and our Retail business. And so in the third quarter, I talked about, and we did move some of that margin over. And in the fourth quarter, I think it's a little bit of the same. In the third quarter, it was a little larger adjustment. This one's a little smaller. But it's really there's nothing else there. It's a continuation of what we've seen, which is a pretty decent and strong business in both our Retail business and Full Requirements business. And actually, our origination, our mid-marketing origination business also, and not as many opportunities on the proprietary trading side which, honestly, we're pretty happy about.
Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG: Okay. And can I just come back for a second to the first topic on what you describe as high market share. What do you put down your outperformance to? Is it quality of projects? Is it aggressiveness on price? Is it legacy relationship? Can you give us any flavor there in terms of your performance versus the market?
Armando Pimentel: Well, maybe this is a little corny. But we are spending a significant amount of time, including senior management time, making sure that we are successful in identifying the certainty of long-term cash flows in this Renewables business. So I would expect that to be a similar comment, I guess, if you ask others. But since I'm so close to the situation here and I see what happens every day, it'd be silly for me not to point that out.
Operator: Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs.
Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Two questions: one on the regulated side, one on the non-reg. First on the reg, can you just give comments about your expectations for incremental turnover or changeover at the Florida Commission? And then on the non-regulated side, when you look at your asset portfolio, are there regions or assets that you might view as either non-core or assets that you don't view as being much, both in the way of contributing to earnings growth and therefore you might be willing to -- maybe you're not the logical owner of those assets?
Armando Pimentel: Michael, on the regulated side, the commission side, it'd be really unfair for me to make any comments on that. Clearly, there are four new commissioners, a couple of which have to be confirmed by the Senate in the -- I'm sorry, all four, I apologize, by the Senate in the spring. So I can't predict how that will happen and how the political situation will work itself out. So it'd be inappropriate, really, for me to comment on that. But we certainly would appreciate a stable commission in Florida. On your other question, we look at that. We sold one of our small -- or really, maybe it was large, because it was one of our only coal facilities, last year, the Paza [ph] facility out in California. And we continue to look at it. I wouldn't say that we are active sellers, but I also wouldn't say that investors should be surprised if we sell an asset or two every year that we just determine just don't really fit into our longer-term mix.
Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Okay. And one Florida follow-up. You commented in your prepared remarks regarding a potential renewable-related legislation or regulation in terms of being able to expand your renewable footprint within the regulated utility. Would you not consider adding incremental renewable resources and using the current environmental cost recovery clause as the recovery mechanism for that? Or is there pushback coming at the commission level or elsewhere in the state for doing so?
Armando Pimentel: Yes, that's not an option, to put it through the new environmental clause without specific legislation or regulatory approval. We'll wait and see what happens this spring in the Florida legislature. Certainly, we and others have been proponents of diversifying the fuel mix in Florida. And on the environmental side, certainly building more solar capacity makes a heck of a lot of sense in the Sunshine State. So we are hoping that some legislation or regulation gets moved that will allow us to add to the 110 megawatts that we added over the last couple years. We think again, it's a positive. It'd be a huge positive in terms of diversity, in terms of jobs, in terms of economic development for the state of Florida.
Operator: Next we'll hear from Hasan Doza of Citi.
Hasan Doza - Luminus Management: A couple of quick questions on the Supply and Power and Gas Trading business. I recall in a previous slide, you had shown about 68% of your gross margin being hedged in that business. So I was wondering, for 4Q in 2010, where did the weakness come from? Did it come from execution of the existing backlog or from new businesses?
Armando Pimentel: A little bit of both. I think you're referring to the last time we showed the 2010 gross margin slide, which was the second quarter of this year...
Hasan Doza - Luminus Management: Exactly.
Armando Pimentel: Yes. So the short answer -- maybe the short and the long answer to your question is it was both.
Hasan Doza - Luminus Management: Okay. If I think about the 2011 gross margin that you're highlighting for this business and the percentages in the backlog, what's the best way to think about what's actually embedded in your guidance?
Armando Pimentel: Well, what's actually embedded in our guidance is the midpoint of what you see either on the gross margin side or the EBITDA side. And we provide both of those numbers back in the appendix.
Hasan Doza - Luminus Management: Okay. So when I think about the Supply and Power and Gas Trading business, the amount that's embedded in your guidance is the midpoint of that range between 3.20 to 4.30s?
Armando Pimentel: Correct.
Armando Pimentel: Okay. And just one follow-up question on wind development, I might have missed it. Did you guys talk about how many megawatts you plan to bring online during 2011 versus your previous range of 700 to 1,000 megawatts?
Armando Pimentel: We did not, but our estimate for 2011 does remain 700 to 1,000.
Operator: Next, we'll hear from Jay Dobson of Wunderlich Securities.
James Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc.: A question for you, Armando or Lew. You mentioned acquisitions and sort of said, anything's that big, you should or we should anticipate you to look at. Yet you've talked about Canada and Spain. Should we expect that's a global comment? Or do you think sort of big is appropriate here in the U.S. and it's somewhat more focused internationally?
Lewis Hay: Jay, I'll at least take the lead on that one. Our focus is really North America, and we've bought a few assets in Canada. We like that market. It's hard to say what will happen and it's very hard to speculate on acquisitions, but the vast majority of the things that we would -- first of all, we don't have any acquisitions in our forecasts, per se, but to the extent that we do any, I would expect them to be domestic. I would point out that sometimes there are things that we look at for other reasons. Sometimes we don't know whether it's attractive and sometimes we want to learn about what's going on in the market and that sort of thing. So as I've said for probably the whole time I've been CEO, if something major is on the market, don't be surprised if we're at least taking a look at it. We're a logical buyer for a lot of things. And I think we have a pretty good track record over the years. But it's not a huge amount of money spent or assets over the last 10 years or so.
James Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc.: And Lew, while I've got you, you mentioned in your closing comments the goal of, I think, 80% regulated and contracted EBITDA by 2014. How would that compare with current? I mean, I think of you guys as substantially, certainly, a majority regulated and contracted EBITDA. So is that going up by more than I expect it is?
Lewis Hay: Yes, currently it's 74%. I think we've said that in the prepared remarks. And I want to just be a little picky with you on one word. The 80% is a projection right now, it's not necessarily a goal. But that's where -- based on all of the assumptions that go into our plan, that's where it looks like things will play out.
James Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc.: And then Armando, pension. You've got an overfunded pension plan. Income was probably a little better in '10 than you expected. Just impact on '11, as you think about it, maybe changing for smoothing and sort of what you have in guidance?
Armando Pimentel: Jay, at this point, I expect very little change in what we had forecasted related to pension earnings for next year.
James Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc.: And does that include any change in the smoothing?
Armando Pimentel: No, no changes in the smoothing, which is not a technical term, but we'll go with it for this call.
Operator: Next, we'll hear from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: What I wanted to ask you guys was about the Power Supply business and where you saw the opportunity on the Full Requirements side. But also on the, I guess, the shopping side, how shopping might impact your Full Requirements portfolio? But also where you might see some potential to pick up some margin? Because it looks like that's been improving steadily for the last couple of quarters in your outlook. And I was just wondering if you could give us a little bit of flavor there, maybe what service territories or regions that look particularly attractive to you?
James Robo: Paul, this is Jim Robo. I think from a Full Requirement standpoint, I think it's all the various regions that we've always played in there, both on a RFP basis and on a originated basis. So that would be New England's PGM and Texas in the Midwest. And then from a retail standpoint, we're seeing good growth opportunities in Texas. And frankly, there's good headroom in PGM and some of the New England markets as well.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Okay. Is there any exposure? When we think about the Full Requirements contracts, we've seen some companies that participate in these auctions, and then there's been some erosions due to customer migration. Is that something that we -- how do we think about that in terms of, a, an opportunity for you guys to get customers from other people, and, b, perhaps a risk in terms of the hedge position?
Armando Pimentel: I think it's both. It's not a kid business. I mean it's a grown-up business, the Full Requirements business. And we've clearly seen in the past, after a bad season or a bad year, that folks kind of fall away from the business and there's little competition the following year. So I think that does present more opportunities. And certainly for those that pick them up, pick the contracts up and the load up, including us, that that presents more risk. And we think we have appropriately priced those risks and haven't been too surprised by what's happened this year. Weather, obviously, is what I would think is the biggest risk. But then you've got what you're talking about, Paul, which is the risk of folks walking in into the deal or folks walking out. So we haven't been surprised by the results up to this point, but that continues to be a risk for this business.
Operator: And we will take a follow-up from Steve Fleishman of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Steven Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch: A question for Lew. I guess, you obviously have one of your neighbors involved in a large M&A transaction recently. And just curious your take on how important that kind of large-scale M&A might be in terms of your strategy and just your general take on it?
Lewis Hay: I'm only surprised that we ended up with the last question before we got to this question. I'm trying to come up with the right way to say that, Steve. Look, we really believe that we have strong stand-alone growth plans. We've consistently been growing this business at a rate that's, and this is off the top of my head, I think the top quartile in the industry over the last decade. I've talked a lot about the growth that we have going forward. I continue to be very bullish on the Florida market long term. I've always thought that this industry -- it was a real original thought on my part, that this industry should consolidate. That's a joke. People have talked about that for years and years and years. And yet when I look at sort of the growth that we've achieved, in many ways we've effectively added the equivalent of several medium-sized utilities over the years. So we've tried to do this before. We realize that there's a lot of challenges and distractions associated on the M&A side. Having said that, we are always going to be opportunistic about it. We have a fiduciary responsibility to look at the things that come our way. And our criteria for M&A hasn't changed. And we always look at M&A from a standpoint: is it economically attractive? Is it feasible from a regulatory perspective? And is it socially doable? Those have proven to be a tough set of barriers over the years for getting transactions done. So I'm not sure that's a very clear answer for you, Steve, but maybe intentionally so. I guess the bottom line is that we're always open to it, but our focus is on growing our business and building shareholder value that way.
Operator: And I'll turn the call back over to the presenters for any additional or closing comments.
Rebecca Kujawa: Thank you, everybody, for your joining us today on the conference call and for your interest in our business. And we look forward to speaking with you again soon.
Operator: That does conclude today's conference. Thank you, all, for your participation.

===== 2010 Q2  (2010-08-02 09:00:00) =====
Executives: Rebecca Kujawa - IR Lew Hay - CEO Armando Pimentel - CFO Jim Robo - President and COO Armando Olivera - President and CEO, Florida Power & Light Company Mitch Davidson - President and CEO, NextEra Energy Resources
Analysts: Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank Steve Fleishman - Bank of America Greg Gordon - Morgan Stanley Brian Chin - Citi Jay Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Angie Storozynski - Macquarie
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the NextEra Energy second quarter 2010 earnings release conference call. At this time for opening remarks, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Rebecca Kujawa.
Rebecca Kujawa: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter 2010 earnings conference call. Lew Hay, NextEra Energy's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of NextEra Energy's performance and recent accomplishments. Lew will be followed by Armando Pimentel, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss the specifics of our financial results. Also joining us this morning are Jim Robo, President and Chief Operating Officer of NextEra Energy; Armando Olivera, President and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light Company; and Mitch Davidson, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources, which we will refer to as Energy Resources during this presentation. Following our prepared remarks, our senior management team will be available to take your questions. We will be making statements during this call that are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release, in the comments made during this conference call, in the Risk Factors section of the accompanying presentation, or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found in the Investors section of our website, www.nexteraenergy.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. Please also note that today's presentation includes references to adjusted earnings, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying this presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of the non-GAAP measure to the closest GAAP financial measure. With that, I will turn the call over to Lew Hay.
Lew Hay: Thank you, Rebecca, and good morning everyone. I'm pleased to report that NextEra Energy grew adjusted earnings per share by 12% over the prior-year quarter from $0.99 to $1.11. Now, it's important to note that some of this growth is due to the positive effects of weather on our portfolio. The wind resource at Energy Resources was 96% of normal, and we experienced record warm temperatures in Florida. In fact, as measured by cooling degree hours, June was the third hottest month in 60 years in Florida Power & Light's service territory. However, beyond favorable weather, our strategy of investing in clean, renewable and efficient generation continued to bear fruit. In fact, on a weather-normalized basis, we have achieved a 7% year-to-date increase in adjusted earnings per share compared to the period last year. One example of this strategy at work is our West County Energy Center in Palm Beach County where our new Units 1 and 2 helped second quarter earnings while delivering lower fuel costs and cleaner air for customers. We have similarly compelling investment opportunities as we look to the future. For example, we announced our decision to invest approximately $2 billion on the modernizations of our Cape Canaveral and Riviera power plants. We estimate these new units will save customers $850 million to $950 million over the life of the plants compared with keeping the existing facilities in the fleet. And they will improve air quality by reducing particulate emissions by an estimated 88% at these sites and improve the plants' carbon dioxide emission rates by roughly 50%. At Energy Resources, we have approximately 540 megawatts of new wind already in service or under construction and likely to be commissioned in 2010. In addition to building new wind projects, we continued to make progress in the quarter on signing long-term power purchase agreements for our existing wind projects, which we expect will continue to improve our earnings risk profile in this part of the business. We also announced that we would invest in 100 megawatts of solar thermal generation in Spain. In a few minutes, Armando will bring you up to speed regarding some of the positive recent developments on this project. As some of you know, I had the privilege of being at the New York Stock Exchange last month to mark the change of our stock ticker symbol to NEE. That was the final step in the process of changing our name from FPL Group to NextEra Energy, which better reflects our scope as one of the largest and cleanest power companies in the industry. On the national front, the Environmental Protection Agency's proposed new rule governing the emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides has the potential to reshape our sector over the next several years. Those of you who have been listening to these calls for any length of time have heard me say that NextEra Energy is very well positioned for a world where carbon is priced. What sometimes gets lost is that we are also very well positioned for a world where carbon is not priced. With or without legislation to address climate change, the EPA is moving to strengthen environmental protections in multiple ways that will have a significant impact on the electric power sector. This extends well beyond the agency's recently issued replacement for the Clean Air Interstate Rule. It includes new rules regulating hazardous air pollutants such as mercury, tighter controls on coal ash and of course the EPA's own efforts to regulate carbon emissions. At NextEra Energy, we are not completely immune to potential adverse effects of these proposed changes, but with roughly 4% of our electricity production fueled by coal and only 3% by oil, we believe our long-term strategy of building a clean generation fleet will prove to be the right one, for the environment and our shareholders alike. With that, I will now turn the call over to Armando Pimentel before returning for some final comments at the end.
Armando Pimentel: Thank you, Lew, and good morning everyone. I'd like to share a couple of additional accomplishments before getting into the financial details of the quarter. In April, Energy Resources completed a differential membership transaction designed to support the continued growth of our wind business. This was the second differential membership transaction for Energy Resources and the first since 2007. Our transaction follows the common structure of tax equity partnership deals. The transaction consisted of a sale of roughly $190 million membership interest in approximately 170 megawatts of wind energy projects in North Dakota. Including some project-level debt issued in a separate transaction, we have recovered approximately 82% of the total capital invested during development of these projects. The differential membership transaction will allow us to more efficiently utilize the value of tax incentives such as production tax credits by managing the amount of deferred Production Tax Credits on our balance sheet. We are pleased that the market for differential membership opportunities appears to be opening back up and is a viable option to support the growth plans at Energy Resources at only slightly higher rates than those available before the economic downturn. Including the debt associated with the differential membership transaction, we have completed $638 million in project level finance transactions year-to-date. Also during the quarter, FPL Group Capital sold $250 million of principal amount of its debentures. Finally, as we highlighted at the Investor Conference in May, Florida Power & Light closed its Global Credit Facility. This new facility is a $500 million, three-year bank revolving credit agreement and is incremental to the existing $2.5 billion credit facility available to FPL. And it is truly global. Only European and Asian banks are participating in the facility. Let me take a moment to discuss the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, also known as the Reform Act, which President Obama signed into law this week. The Reform Act grants the CFTC broad authority in determining what entities will be subject to the new rules governing over-the-counter commodity transactions. While the details of the legislation will become clearer as the regulations are drafted, recent comments from key legislative supporters, including Senators Dodd and Lincoln, indicated that their intent behind the language of the Reform Act was to exclude companies using swaps to hedge or manage commercial risk from many of the new rules. We will continue to closely monitor the regulations, assessing the potential impact on both Florida Power & Light and Energy Resources. In the second quarter of 2010, NextEra Energy's GAAP net income was $417 million or $1.01 per share compared to $370 million or $0.91 per share during the 2009 second quarter. NextEra Energy's adjusted 2010 second quarter net income and EPS were $457 million and $1.11 per share respectively compared with $401 million or $0.99 per share in 2009. The difference between the GAAP results and the adjusted results is the exclusion of the mark in our non-qualifying hedge category and the exclusion of net other than temporary impairments on certain investments, or OTTI. Weather had a positive effect on this quarter's comparable earnings. Compared to normal weather, there were offsetting effects across our portfolio due to the diversity of our company's operations in terms of geography, fuel and other factors. This slide shows the impact of weather during the second quarter, both against the prior year and against normal. Relative to prior year, weather had a positive impact on both Florida Power & Light and Energy Resources, resulting in a positive $0.07 impact to adjusted earnings per share at NextEra Energy. At Energy Resources, the wind resource was approximately 96% relative to the long-term expected average, a significant improvement from the prior two quarters and up from the approximately 89% of normal in the second quarter last year. So far in July, the wind resource has been close to normal. Year-to-date, NextEra Energy's consolidated adjusted earnings have been reduced by $0.01 per share relative to normal weather. For the second quarter, Florida Power & Light reported net income of $265 million compared with $213 million in last year's second quarter. The corresponding contributions to EPS were $0.64 this year compared to $0.52 last year. The table shown here summarizes the earnings drivers for Florida Power & Light for the just completed quarter. In total, earnings increased by $0.12 per share, driven primarily by weather and the increase in base revenues related to West County Energy Center Units 1 and 2, and the impact of our base rate increase. These results were partially offset by higher O&M costs and lower AFUDC, which are due primarily to the commissioning of these West County Energy Center units. Included in O&M is $0.03 in costs associated with our workforce reductions, which were implemented during the quarter. Although we are including these costs as part of our adjusted earnings, it is important that we point out that these will obviously not be normally recurring costs. We are continuing to see some improvement as it relates to our customer metrics. The table in the upper left shows a change in retail kilowatt-hour sales versus last year's comparable period. Overall, retail kilowatt-hour sales grew by 3%, an improvement due primarily to higher weather-related usage. Non-weather-related, or underlying, usage growth, mix and all other, was lower by 0.5% The graph in the upper right-hand corner indicates a sequential increase in customer accounts. As of June 30, 2010, we had approximately 24,000 more customers than we did at the end of June 2009. As we have discussed on the last two earnings calls, we have been cautiously optimistic that our customer growth has been returning over the last couple of quarters and we are encouraged that it appears that this trend has held up after the end of the winter season. We consider this customer increase to be a positive development, reversing the negative trend that we were seeing last year. The graph on the bottom left of the page shows inactive and low usage customers, which we believe depicts the level of empty homes in our service territory. Since the fourth quarter of last year, we have been experiencing improvements in both inactive and low usage customers. Although inactive accounts rose modestly in the second quarter, the increases were smaller than what we have seen in the past associated with normal seasonal patterns. Low usage accounts have improved modestly since the end of the first quarter. The chart on the bottom right depicts the level of new housing starts for single family homes in FPL's service territory. Housing starts are a fairly good leading indicator of certain additions to our customer base roughly a year out. Although it appears that housing starts are no longer declining, we have yet to see clear signs that housing starts are significantly improving. This chart, coupled with the inactive and low usage chart, tells us that our new customers appear to be primarily coming from formerly empty homes. We would expect this trend to continue in the short-term. And let me just take this opportunity to briefly address the gulf oil spill. While we currently don't see any imminent threat to FPL's coastal plants that are using cooling water from the Gulf or Atlantic Ocean, events of this kind are difficult to predict and we cannot guarantee that we won't experience adverse effects. Although the well appears to be capped, we continue to monitor the effects of the spill around the clock to ensure we are ready to take protective measures should they become necessary. During the second quarter, several events occurred that will affect the Florida Public Service Commission. In April, the Florida Senate voted not to confirm Commissioners Stephens and Klement. Last week, Governor Crist appointed Ron Brisé and Arthur Graham to fill these vacant positions. These new commissioners will need to be confirmed by the Florida Senate next spring. Separately, in the next couple of months the Nominating Council will provide additional nominations to Governor Crist, who will then make two new appointments to the commission when the new term begins on January 2, 2011. Ultimately, these new appointments also need to be confirmed by the Florida Senate during the spring. Yesterday the staff of the Public Service Commission issued their recommendation on the issues outlined in our Motion for Reconsideration on our rate case. The agenda conference is scheduled for August 3. We expect to communicate more after there is resolution on this matter. Let me now turn to Energy Resources. Since the first quarter of 2009 we have added approximately 1,460 megawatts of new wind and continue to be the nation's leading producer of wind power. We have continued to make progress on our solar development pipeline, which includes more than 500 megawatts of projects expected to be in service by the end of 2014. To date, we have received $525 million in cash from convertible investment tax credits, or CITCs, including $470 million related to our 2009 wind projects, and $55 million from our 2010 wind development. As we mentioned in the first quarter earnings release, we believe we will elect to take CITCs on roughly 600 megawatts of new wind projects we expect to complete during 2010. In May, Energy Resources entered into a joint venture agreement with PetroQuest Energy to produce shale gas, primarily in the Woodford region. As we highlighted at our investor conference, we are making relatively modest investments in gas infrastructure, including shale gas production, over the next 5 years, and this transaction is consistent with that strategy. We believe these investments should offer our shareholders attractive returns with manageable risks. We are already a significant player in the natural gas business due to our position as the largest consumer of natural gas in the power sector, and we think this investment will complement our existing assets and enhance our market knowledge. For 2010, we are well-hedged against the impacts of natural gas price movements, and very significantly hedged against other price movements, including spark spreads. The appendix to this presentation contains both the typical information we provide to you regarding our hedging status, as well as updates to the incremental information we provided at our investor conference and on our website. We would like to highlight two changes that we have made to the slides. The first change is to consolidate the gross margin contributions from gas infrastructure investments into one line item. Previously we had new gas infrastructure investments included in the "New Investment" line item, and now new gas infrastructure investments are included with existing gas infrastructure investments in the "Gas Infrastructure" line. The second change is to the percentage hedged calculation for contracted wind assets. Previously we had assumed that assets that we expected to be contracted in the near term were 100% hedged. The percentage of gross margin hedged now reflects only those PPA's that have actually been executed. Energy Resources' reported second quarter 2010 GAAP earnings of $154 million, or $0.38 per share compared with $163 million, or $0.40 per share in the prior period. Adjusted earnings for the same periods, which exclude the effect of non-qualifying hedges and net OTTI, were $195 million compared to $194 million. The equivalent adjusted earnings per share contributions were $0.48 in both periods. As we mentioned in the first quarter, we have changed the methodology for allocating interest and shared cost to affiliates, and the historical figures have been adjusted to reflect the change. As I just mentioned, Energy Resources' second quarter adjusted EPS was flat relative to last year's comparable quarter. New wind investments contributed $0.03 per share. In aggregate, the existing asset portfolio contributed $0.01 relative to the prior year. Our existing wind assets contributed $0.02 driven by better wind resource and lower curtailments in Texas, offset by several factors, none of which are particularly noteworthy. Contributions from the NEPOOL portfolio improved by $0.02 a share, owing primarily to higher-priced hedges at our Seabrook nuclear facility, which was offset by a negative $0.01 performance from our Texas gas fired facilities as a result of market conditions. The remaining drivers from the existing merchant fleet amounted to negative $0.02, but there is nothing notable in any one category worth calling out. Wholesale marketing and trading activities were flat relative to the prior year. Asset sales contributed $0.01, which represents the gain we realized associated with the sale of our 44 megawatt Port of Stockton coal facility that was completed during the quarter. All other factors were a negative $0.05, primarily due to higher interest expense. It is worth noting that although weather effects compared to normal were better this quarter than the last several quarters, Energy Resources' current quarterly results were lower by roughly $0.04 due to weather versus normal. I would like to provide a brief update on our wind development plans for the remainder of 2010. Since the fall of 2008, our new construction plans have concentrated on developing wind plants where we believe there is a high likelihood that we would sell the plant's power under long term power purchase agreements. Although we continue to experience difficult market conditions for power purchase agreements, we have signed 784 megawatts of new PPAs year-to-date, including 247 megawatts on projects expected to be placed in service in 2011. During the first quarter earnings conference call, I stated that our wind build additions were expected to be between 600 and 850 megawatts in 2010. We currently have approximately 540 megawatts of new wind already in service, or in construction and likely to be commissioned in 2010. Based on our current state of our development pipeline, we continue to believe that we will add between 600 and 850 megawatts of wind in 2010. For 2011, we continue to plan to add 700 to 1000 megawatts of wind generation. Longer-term, we continue to be optimistic about developing and owning wind and solar energy plants. I would also like to provide a quick update regarding our concentrated solar development project in Spain that we highlighted at our investor conference. In July, the Spanish government proposed several changes to the solar thermal tariff, the net of which we believe would be roughly neutral for our project. Regarding the tariff, the government has proposed an ongoing annual cap on the number of hours during which a project can earn the premium tariff and has proposed a fixed rate tariff during the first year of production. We do not believe that either of those proposed changes should significantly alter the economics of our project. We believe changes to the tariff will be finalized over the course of the next several months, and we are actively working with government officials, banks and other parties involved in renewables development in Spain to support our interests. To summarize, the 2010 second quarter, on an adjusted basis, FPL contributed $0.64 per share, Energy Resources contributed $0.48 per share and Corporate and Other contributed a negative $0.01 per share. That is a total of $1.11 compared to $0.99 per share in the 2009 second quarter, or about a 12% increase year-over-year. For 2010, we continue to believe that adjusted EPS expectations within a range of $4.25 and $4.65 are reasonable. In addition, we also believe that 2011 adjusted EPS will fall roughly in the same range. With that, I'll turn the call over to Lew for some concluding remarks.
Lew Hay: Thanks, Armando. I would like to close with the observation that NextEra Energy remains one of the most compelling growth stories in the electric power sector. At a time when many electric power companies will be experiencing flat or declining earnings, we feel very good about our ability to continue to deliver significant adjusted earnings per share growth. This is not to say that we don't face some challenges. At Energy Resources in particular, low power prices will create earnings headwinds, and our ability to grow the renewables business will be somewhat constrained as long we have to rely solely on state renewable portfolio standards to stimulate demand. Even so, the company as a whole continues to enjoy strong growth prospects. At Florida Power & Light, our capital investments are paying off for both customers and shareholders, and we have additional investment opportunities in the form of nuclear uprates and power plant modernizations. Our customer growth has turned positive again, and we see the long-term national demographic trends as fundamentally favorable for Florida and FPL. At Energy Resources, despite a challenging market for renewables, we still believe we can add 3,500 megawatts to 5,000 megawatts of wind through 2014 and another 400 megawatts to 600 megawatts of solar. Add to that the approximately $800 million we expect to invest in new transmission at Lone Star Transmission, and you'll understand why we are hard-pressed to think of another company in the sector with stronger growth prospects. This is especially notable in an industry not known for growth. Consider: The average EPS growth rate for our industry as a whole over the last 10 years has been approximately zero. At NextEra Energy, we've grown adjusted EPS on average by 7.7% over that same period. We feel good about our ability to generate average adjusted earnings per share growth of 5% to 7% through 2014 from a 2009 base. Thank you for listening, and with that, I'll turn the call over for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.
Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse: I was wondering if you guys could share a little more thoughts on the negative usage trends of the utility in the quarter, and what you think is kind of underlying that and the outlook for maybe some improvement?
Armando Pimentel: Yes, Dan, I said it was a 0.5% reduction in non-weather usage. There's a lot of numbers that go into that, and we've been actually looking at that over the last month or so. What I would say is that, and I've said this before, clearly that we are down on weather normalized usage since the very top of what I would call the economic curve back in 2006 or so, and we have talked about that. Since then, it does look to have flattened out some, I would say in the last year or so. But there are a lot of factors that go into that, including the price of natural gas, which as you know, has been pretty volatile during the last 18 to 24 months. So I wouldn't draw a lot of conclusions from my comment that it's 0.5% down year over year. I think that's more of a trend that we need to see, and I'm not sure that we can actually say that everything in Florida is back to normal, certainly not back to where it was in 2006. So we are going to have to keep watching that I think over the next several quarters, and maybe even the next year, to figure out how much of a energy efficiency has taken out of that, and how much of that will come back just with normal economic conditions.
Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse: Okay. Thanks. And then I guess, you were effectively in the tax equity market again. How is pricing and the depth of that market? Is there a chance to start monetizing the legacy PTC balance at some point in time as the markets improve?
Armando Pimentel: Yes, I think you can say that I was actually surprised with the depth of the market; and I have said this before, which is overall the demand for paper that's backed by renewable projects, we could call it fixed income paper, we can even call it equity paper, seems to be pretty strong. You know, we got a number of project level debt transactions done this year, and others did too, and it was very clear to us that the demand was strong, because the economics that we were seeing in those transactions was much better than what we were seeing 12 to 18 months ago. Specifically on the tax equity market, the yields that we were seeing, just last year were double digit after tax yields to the investors. Those are down, and I would say those are down considerably. They are certainly not back to the yields that we were seeing when we did our first transaction back in 2007. But I could say that we are pretty pleased. And I don't think we have formally said what those yields are publicly, but I can tell you that they are pretty far from the double digit number that we were seeing last year that made us feel comfortable to get into the market. I think the depth is there. The depth will continue to be there. As I said last year, for each one of our projects we actually take a look at weather, taking the convertible ITC or actually taking the production tax credits makes the most sense; and in those situations where the production tax credits makes more sense, it would be very likely at this point because of our tax position for us to go out to the differential membership transaction of the tax equity market. So we are pretty comfortable with that market, and it might be something that you would see us tap again this year.
Operator: Thank you, our next question will come from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates: Last time when the staff was going to be filing a recommendation in the rehearing case, you guys and I think the OPC indicated in a letter that you wanted them to delay it, and there have been some press reports indicating that there was a potential for a settlement. This time yesterday the staff came out with a recommendation, and they didn't see any such letter. I guess what I'm sort of wondering is, how should we think about the potential of you guys having a long-term settlement similar to what we saw Progress get a month or so ago?
Armando Pimentel: Let me make a couple of comments and then Armando Olivera may have something to add. I think that, you know, obviously as a technical matter, any one of the rate regulated entities in Florida can reach a settlement on a longer term settlement on their rates really at any time. And whether you have something in front of the commission or not, you can have discussions with the interveners and other interested parties, and put something in front of the commission. I have said before that our situation is a little different than what Progress's was, because we do need rate relief, some sort of revenue recovery on West County energy center number three, which is coming into operations in the summer of next year. I think it's certainly a positive development that Progress was able to reach a settlement that presumably they are comfortable with. And just last week or earlier this week Tampa Electric was able to do the same thing. But we don't comment, we have never commented and we won't comment today, on any discussions that we are having with other parties on this matter. Armando, I don't know whether you have something to add to that?
Armando Olivera: Paul, as you know, we have not made any decisions on whether to appeal to the Supreme Court of the rate case decision. What we're going to do with cost recovery for West County three, whether we're going to go in for a limited scope hearing and when we may file for a rate case. So we think now on all those decisions that we have to make, there is always room for negotiations.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates: Armando, is it possible just, I mean, theoretically or historically for you guys to actually still come up with a global settlement for multi-years with all of those issues being resolved? You mentioned a bunch of them. Should we think of that as basically being sort of a really large hurdle that's unlikely to be? I think they did it with (Heinz) and stuff. I guess what I'm trying to say is how should we think about, when you mention all of those items that are happening, is it still possible that those all could be wrapped up sort of together though?
Armando Olivera: Paul, I don't want to go beyond this, the statement that I said. But just to tell you that we have all of these decisions to make in each one of these points. We would always be open to settlement discussions.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates: And then on the appendix in the 2011 portfolio hedging activity and expected gross margin, earlier in the year you guys had expected that the power and gas trading and the power supply businesses, it looks like there's been a bit of a change in those. It looks like power and gas trading is a little bit lower, and it looks like you guys have I think a considerable increase in the supply business. Could you just review what's leading to that outlook change?
Armando Pimentel: Sure, Paul. I think I heard you say 2011 and you may have meant 2010, but the 2011 numbers and the two lines that you just mentioned were roughly negative $10 million in power and gas, and a positive $10 million in power supply. I don't really consider those to be very significant in businesses that in 2011 have less than 50% of that margin locked up. If you look at 2010, you will see that there is a roughly $45 million reduction in gross margin for power and gas trading, and roughly a $35 million increase in power supply, and that's just what we are seeing this year. Not only are we seeing some significant opportunities come up in the power supply business, the full requirements business, but we have done okay in that business, more okay than we believe that we were going to do in the first quarter. And on the power and gas trading side of the business, as I think I've mentioned in just about every quarter, I don't think I mentioned it this quarter. And it's really difficult on a quarter-to-quarter basis to predict what's going to happen there. We take advantage of the market opportunities that exist, sometimes they do exist and we do okay in that space, and sometimes they don't exist and we don't do as well as what we expected at the beginning of the year, so that's just a reflection on what we are seeing currently and what we would expect to see for the rest of the year.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates: Okay. I'm sorry. What I'm looking at is, I'm looking at the backlog, and it looks to me like it says power and gas trading 180 to 280, and before I have it at 200 to 310. And I'm looking at the full requirements, when you add them up it's around 185 on the top side, 135 on the lower side for gross margin, and now it looks like the supply business comes out to 170 to 210.
Armando Pimentel: The numbers I just gave you are the midpoints of those gross margin numbers as opposed to taking them at the bottom or the top of the range. That's how I look at it.
Operator: We'll hear next from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.
Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank: Thank you for the disclosure on PPAs and the wind. I think if I heard it right, you said you had signed 784 megawatts of new ones in calendar year 2010, and the 247 had been for 2011. Can you give us extra granularity, how much of the 784 was on 2009 projects and where are you on the 2009 portfolio now? And maybe some commentary around the AEP transaction of a month or so ago?
Armando Pimentel: We roughly have 400 megawatts or so of projects from 2010 or before 2010 that are uncontracted, Jonathan. And so some of those are from this year and some of those are from prior years. So I think we are having, by all accounts, a pretty good year in signing long-term power purchase agreements based on what we and others are seeing in the market. That transaction that you just mentioned, that AEP transaction, that is not included in the 784 megawatts. We're selling that power today; we were selling that power before out into the market. We've identified several RFPs in the area where that project would be in good standing to actually fulfill that requirement, but we're not counting that as a signed contract at this point. We went back and we looked at our information since we have been doing this. We couldn't find another contract that had not been approved by a regulator. We've continued to believe that that's a good project, good location, and it would have made a lot of sense for the customer. But we have to move on; we have to seek the next opportunity in the area, and we feel pretty confident that we will be able to sign a long-term PPA in the near future.
Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank: You said you've got 400 megawatts of pre-2010 that's uncontracted, but you're not saying how much of the contracts are on this year and how much are on pre-2010?
Armando Pimentel: We're not breaking that out, and I don't have the numbers with me. And that's not the way I look at it; I look at it as a big pot. We need contracts for most of that, and so take a look at the 784, as, you know, that's our inventory. It's a pretty good sign-off rate at this point.
Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank: Agreed. If I might, just on another topic, you talked about the financial reform legislation briefly, and the intent being to exclude companies that use swaps to hedge. Do you have any feeling at this point about potential implications for your trading and/or the retail business?
Armando Pimentel: I don't. It's been an extremely interesting process, and I don't say that lightly. I mean, we have a law now, law of the land, but we've got a heck of a lot of rules that need to be written, particularly by the CFTC. And they've got a deadline to write some of those rules within three months, six months, and some of those rules within a year. The definitions of swap dealers, the definitions of commercial end users, the definitions of really what derivatives are, are going to be very important in the final interpretations. I can tell you that the letter from Senators Dodd and Lincoln seems to have made a big difference. I think most folks that believe that they are just hedging for commercial purposes, and they take physical delivery of the product, are feeling like, well, this rule is not necessarily going to affect me. And I use 'affect' pretty narrowly. In other words, it's not going to affect me because I may not have to clear it through an exchange, and therefore provide mark-to-market margin. But even for those folks, it's unclear whether there are going to be changes in the marketplace, i.e. with derivative counterparties that will actually flow back and change how they do business. But at least I feel much better on that side of the business. The other side, or I'll call it the middle side of the business, and those folks, many folks like us that are dynamic hedgers, I mean, we clearly are hedging our assets longer-term, but in some cases we put on a hedge, and we take off a hedge and we put on another hedge for economic purposes, clearly a strategy that most people in the country do. That pot's in the middle. I'd say that you should fall under the exception for commercial end users and you should be okay, but we are going to have to see that in the rules. The rest of the business, I just don't know. Clearly, we and others have a lot of interest. EEI has a lot of interest in how the rules are going to be written by the CFTC, but at this point I just don't see a giant change to anything that we do.
Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank: And is that including within the pure trading operation?
Armando Pimentel: Yes, I mean, a lot of the stuff in what I call the pure trading operation is already on exchanges. So I mean there might be changes, but where I sit today, I just don't see any giant changes in what we do.
Operator: We'll hear next from Bank of America's Steve Fleishman.
Steve Fleishman - Bank of America: I guess two questions, first on the regulatory side. My recollection is, when you gave this 2011 flat guidance, you assumed that West County 3 was not recovered. Is that correct, in 2011?
Armando Pimentel: Yes, that is correct.
Steve Fleishman - Bank of America: Do you feel any better with some of the changes made, that you'll be able to find a solution to recover that on a timely basis? And if so, what would that do to the guidance range, or within the guidance range?
Armando Pimentel: Steve, I think it's a little earlier for me and for us to say that we feel any better or any worse about the recovery of West County 3. I mean, clearly we feel that longer term, we're going to get recovery, and feel pretty good about the return that we would get longer-term for putting that asset in service. As it relates to 2011, though, I think Armando Olivera was pretty clear that there's just a number of items that we have in front of us that we have to get through. And it's just really too early for us to say what, if any, effects would be different from what we gave you back in 2011. One of the things that I want to make sure that we say, and Lew talked about it at the beginning as it dealt with the modernizations, Cape Canaveral and Riviera, but there are significant customer savings associated with us bringing these plants online; very, very significant. At this point when you go back to where we are at right now, these are great plants for us to bring online, and for our customers to be getting power from. So that's why I feel comfortable that longer-term, the recovery and the return for our shareholders will be there. But as it relates to 2011, it's just too early for us to say what's going to happen.
Steve Fleishman - Bank of America: And then on a separate topic, just maybe if you guys could give us some update on what you're seeing in federal legislation. It looks like we're not going to have an energy bill with carbon or renewable standards. Any update on those issues, but also any update on the renewable tax credit issues?
Armando Pimentel: Well, that's a great question. Obviously there's been a lot of press in the last couple of days as to the Senate, and not moving forward on a comprehensive energy bill. A little disappointing from our side. I'll actually go a little further than that, very disappointing from our side, because we continue to believe that lopping together something on longer-term pricing for carbon, a bill that would also include some incentives for renewable generation, potentially transmission, would not only be good for the economic side of what we are facing right now in the US, but would be tremendous benefit to the public at large. And as Lew has mentioned before, that if we don't get on with it, that other countries in the world certainly aren't going to hold back, and eventually we will lose the small head start that we have in overall renewable technology here in the U.S. So as far as the future, I don't know. I mean, certainly none of us can predict the future. It doesn't look like the current Congress has any appetite to try to tackle it before the elections. I doubt seriously that it would be tackled between the elections and when the next Congress gets sworn in. So it's probably something that we will be looking at in 2011. Beyond that, there's really nothing else. I think Lew has something to say.
Lew Hay: Yes, the only thing I want to add to that is, even though the Congress isn't taking it up, EPA is not stopping. They are moving forward on a whole host of regulations, some of which are directly dealing with carbon, but others will indirectly deal with carbon. And whether it's mercury, coal, ash, the (haps) or just what they are doing on carbon directly, there's still a lot of changes that are going to be impacting our industry, and frankly going to make certain plants in the country uneconomic. So there's effectively going to be a price on carbon, and you might even argue it's a differential price by region, by plant, whatever, and there's clearly a lot more uncertainty. It's not where we would like things to be, and I don't think it's where most people in our industry would like things to be. So there's still going to be pressure to do something, because this is clearly not the optimal way to be regulating emissions in our industry.
Operator: Our next question will come from Greg Gordon with Morgan Stanley.
Greg Gordon - Morgan Stanley: Most of my questions frankly, have been answered quite thoroughly. But could you delve a little bit further into what's going on, both in the pure sort of gas and power markets vis-à-vis the drop in opportunities? Is that really because of sort of a diminishing liquidity as everyone kind of steps back to try to figure out these rules? And so sort of post-CFTC getting on with putting the details in front of us, should we see an increase in liquidity, and then an increase in profit-making opportunity in that business? That's my first question. Or am I making a false correlation there? Second question is, on the retail side of the business in terms of the increase you've seen in opportunities, is that really just because of the spread between retail pricing and wholesale pricing? Is that because customers are becoming less sticky? Is there any particular market in which you've made inroads? So that's just two questions but I guess in 27 parts.
Armando Pimentel: Greg, let me make sure I understand your first question that dealt with the power and gas markets. Are you talking about project development opportunities?
Greg Gordon - Morgan Stanley: The pure trading activity, has it diminished because of the uncertainty around the rules, and is that part of the reason why the margin opportunity is diminished?
Armando Pimentel: I guess what we hear and what you'll hear, you should certainly hear from others is, and it's no different in our space than it would be in the financial space; but when there's a limit on volatility in prices, that tends to dampen down on the opportunities that are available in the market. Folks that are in this business every day, and are buying and selling the commodity, not necessarily for physical delivery, love to see volatility in the markets, whether it's volatility on the way up or volatility on the way down. When you start limiting the amount of volatility, especially in the short-term, that tends to drive down the number of opportunities. At least at this point, I don't think that it's uncertainty over the financial regulatory reform. Although some of our larger counterparties, which would be the banks, are clearly very concerned as to what this is going to mean from a capital allocation standpoint. But that might be something that plays out in the future, but at least what we've seen in the past, it's really just a lack of volatility in the commodity market, at least in the gas and power market. Your second point about, because I did mention we are doing a little bit better on the full requirements front than what we expected to do at the beginning of the year, I don't know that you can attribute it to any one factor. I think the factors certainly that you pointed out, which have to deal with retail pricing and the spread there is one, but I think it's also the number of people that are in the market. You know, we're seeing, especially in some of what I would call the larger transactions, we're not seeing as many people in the market as we were seeing before. That doesn't necessarily mean that there won't be. One of the larger players that, I won't mention who that is, but one of the larger players that seemed to have pulled out of the market last year is now back in very aggressively. So I think it changes, maybe as management focus changes as they perceive opportunities. But at least for the rest of this year, we feel relatively comfortable that the small piece of business that we do there will continue to come to us.
Greg Gordon - Morgan Stanley: So you're seeing more wins in the big sort of wholesale load serving options, not necessarily a big increase in penetration in competitive retail?
Armando Pimentel: Yes. I mean, it's certainly growing; your latter comment. But I wouldn't say it's a significant increase in penetration and new markets.
Operator: We'll go next to Citi's Brian Chin.
Brian Chin - Citi: You had made a comment earlier on the Motion for Reconsideration that the agenda conference is scheduled for August 3 and you expect to communicate more after there's a resolution on the matter. Should I take from your comment that you expect resolution of the matter to occur on August 3, or am I reading too much into that comment?
Armando Pimentel: Well, you're reading a little too much into the comment. I actually didn't say much in my prepared remarks. I think it was three sentences, and they were factual sentences. And that sentence was meant to deal with the fact that the agenda conference is scheduled for August 3. So it was really just a factual kind of matter. I wouldn't read anything more into my comments. Armando Olivera made some very good points as to what's in front of us and what the opportunities might be for something else to happen. And beyond that, we really just can't comment on it.
Operator: We'll hear next from Jay Dobson with Wunderlich Securities.
Jay Dobson - Wunderlich Securities: Armando, I was wondering if you could just help me get a little more clarity around the contracting environment for wind. You said in your prepared comments it remains difficult, which I think we have heard from many. But I'm wondering if you can just try and compare Q1 to Q2, because obviously you're having a reasonable amount of success contracting 784 in what is otherwise a difficult environment. So I guess if we sort of drill down there a little bit, is it fair to say we are seeing some glimmers of hope and it's getting a little easier, or is it just still equally as difficult as it was in the first quarter, and you all are just having successes for a myriad of reasons? Just help me understand that.
Armando Pimentel: I'm not being critical, Jay. I don't know that I'd use the word 'easy' in any comment that I would make regarding the contracting market. I think I would say, and we've said before, that all other things held constant, as load picks up because the economy picks up, folks feel better; and by folks, I mean our potential customers. The large utilities feel better about taking on longer-term contracts to meet their own obligations, which is, as load decreased over the last couple of years that the amount of power that they were getting from renewable sources, hence increased. And as the economy gets better, as folks start feeling better, I do believe that the opportunities will continue to pick up for us. The environment clearly is not as difficult as it was last year. But as I mentioned, both in the fourth quarter last year and in the first quarter this year, it's a number of factors; it's not just the reduction in load, it's really the uncertainty as to what's going on a Federal level regarding energy legislation. It's also the fact that production tax credits do not expire at the end of this year. I mean, it's a number of factors. And so, although as a team we feel very good about having signed 784 megawatts of wind this year, and feel very good about 247 of that being for next year, we recognize that wind build across the U.S. is down. I don't think AWI has come out with their second quarter numbers yet, but I would expect that when they do come out, they are not going to be numbers that we can all kind of jump on the table and cheer about. But in that environment, we continue to do I think very well; 600 to 850 this year, 700 to 1,000 next year, 784 signed this year. We feel better about what we are doing, we feel better about our development opportunities, but it's a really, really far cry as to what we were seeing back in 2007. I don't know that I can add any more color to that, Jay.
Jay Dobson - Wunderlich Securities: That's very helpful. I guess the only thing I would ask is, is again, you're saying it's better than '09, and I'm just wondering, it sounds like it's just the same as Q1. So in any sequential change, you would say there's none relative to that environment, and fully understand it's a myriad of elements.
Armando Pimentel: I just don't think there's enough of talking difference between the first and second quarter really for me to kind of paint a line in the sand and say its better or it's the same.
Jay Dobson - Wunderlich Securities: That's very fair. And then on the acquisition environment, you all didn't address that, and I know it's always things you look at, so maybe there's nothing to say, but wind acquisitions as it applies to 2010?
Armando Pimentel: Sometimes I feel like a yo-yo on this, right? I felt good about potential acquisitions fourth quarter of last year as to what we had going forward. I think in the first quarter I made comments that I wasn't as positive that something might be able to get done by the end of this year on the asset front as I had felt last year. Sitting here today, I feel a little better than the comments that I made in the fourth quarter last year. But it takes two to tango, if you will. There's been a number of transactions, as you know, that have been pulled from the market this year because folks didn't like the price that us and others kind of put on the table. Whether that changes or not, the rest of the year remains to be seen. We continue to be active, looking at a number of projects, but the price that we are willing to pay is a price that gives us a good return for our shareholders, and this is not the market that it was in 2006 and 2007, even 2008, when some of these folks first got into these projects, first started getting permits, first started getting their wind turbines ordered at a pretty high price. So everybody has got to get comfortable with the ultimate transaction price. But the final thought that I would leave you with. is we are looking at a number of opportunities that we think would be great opportunities if they come to fruition.
Operator: Will take our next question from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie.
Angie Storozynski - Macquarie: Just wanted to continue the wind questions. Given where natural gas prices are, and if not for the heat, one could speculate if the forward curve wouldn't be lower as of today. How can you be convinced about your growth prospects beyond, say, 2011? You're hoping to exceed the 700 to 1,000 megawatts per annum growth expectations. We are not seeing any extension, at least for now for cash grants. There is no settled renewable energy standards in the works anymore. So what's the basis for the enthusiasm?
Jim Robo: First of all, even though the short-term power prices are well right now, and I think all of us agree, the fact that load is down and short-term power prices are low, it takes away an incentive for customers to sign long-term agreements right now. When you look at it, the value of the long-term wind contract, relative to our customers' site plans or our customers' integrated resource plans, the value of wind remains very compelling on a long-term basis. And so we feel very comfortable from that standpoint. There continues to be demand from a state RPS standpoint. We would all love to have a federal RPS. And none of us have given up on the fact that we may get one sometime in the future. But in the meantime, there remain significant pockets of demand. And to give you a sense, our view this year, I think we said at the earnings conference that this would be a 4000 to 6000 megawatt year build. I think some of us would say it's probably closer to 4000 or 5000 megawatt build in the U.S. this year. That's still what the build was in I think '06 or '07, and we did 1000 megawatts in '06 and '07. So fundamentally, I continue to feel in the long term very bullish about wind, and particularly because it remains a tremendous value to our customers in the long term.
Angie Storozynski - Macquarie: And one more question about the reclassification of hedge disclosure. So why would you classify wind farms that are likely to get contracted? Is that your perception of the market appetite for those wind farms? And that means that those new contracts are really going to happen within the next quarter, and that you classify them as contracted?
Jim Robo: Really, two parts to that. The first part is, we had historically included those wind projects that we did not consider hedged. So a lot of the construction that we did in Texas in '05, '06 and '07, we never expected those to be long-term contracted. And we expected those to be hedged on a long-term basis. And so we have historically treated those separately as hedged wind in our disclosure. But really everywhere else in the U.S., we always expected those to be long-term contracted. And I have talked before about the fact that some of our wind don't have long term contracts, but we continue to include them in contracted. What we did this quarter was just to change that a bit; we continue to put them in contracted because again that's our expectation that we will have long term contracts or wouldn't have built the projects in the first place. But we changed the percentage hedged so that we no longer include in the gross margin hedged; we no longer include that margin that is not contracted. So I consider it a small change. We continue to feel comfortable. We have 7600 megawatts of wind, roughly 400 of that is uncontracted; roughly 16 to 1700 of that is hedged. So the 400 is a very small number in the overall scheme of things. I just wanted to make the change in the gross margin table because I just kind of felt better about it actually.
Operator: And that is all the time we have for questions. So I would like to turn the call back to our speakers for any closing remarks.
Rebecca Kujawa: Thank you everyone for joining us today, and we look forward to speak with you again soon.
Operator: That does conclude today's presentation. We thank you for your participation.
