===== 2025 Q1  (2025-04-22 09:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Northrop Grumman Corporation's First Quarter 2025 Conference Call. This call is being recorded. My name is Josh, and I will be your operator today. At this time, all parties, Mr. Todd Ernst, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Ernst, please proceed.
Todd Ernst: Thanks, Josh, and good morning, everyone. Before we start today, matters discussed on today's call, including guidance and outlooks for 2025 and beyond, reflect the company's judgment based on information available at the time of this call. They constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, including those noted in today's press release, and our SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties may cause actual company results to differ materially. Today's call will include non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to our GAAP results in our earnings release. In addition, we'll refer to a presentation that is posted to our Investor Relations website. On the call today are Kathy Warden, our Chair, CEO and President, and Ken Crews, our CFO. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kathy. Kathy?
Kathy Warden: Thanks, Todd. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our first quarter earnings conference call. A lot has happened since our last call in January. We're looking forward to providing you an update on the quarter, and our expectations for the year. We are operating in a rapidly evolving world, and we are managing through a dynamic US defense budget environment. With a first-of-its-kind full-year continuing resolution. Within this environment, we continue to see strong demand signals from our global customers, resulting in another record backlog in the first quarter of $92.8 billion, and that's inclusive of strong international bookings. As we indicated in mid-February, we've experienced delays in certain awards, which resulted in a slower sales ramp in the first quarter than we previously anticipated. We expect this to improve throughout the year. Margin rates, setting aside the B-21 adjustment, were in line with expectations. We have updated our 2025 financial guidance and we are reaffirming our outlook for sales and free cash flow. With a growing backlog and progress on award timing, we have confidence in achieving our outlook and remain focused on delivering transformative capabilities for our customers. I'd like to take a minute to discuss the B-21 profit adjustment made in the quarter. As you saw in the earnings release, we recognized an additional $477 million pretax loss. This is largely relating to higher manufacturing costs primarily resulting from a process change we made to enable higher production as well as increases in the projected material costs, some of which are related to macroeconomic impacts on material prices. While I'm disappointed with this financial impact, we continue to make solid progress on the program. Demonstrating performance objectives through tests, and we are progressing through the first two lots of production. With significant learning behind us, we are ready to deliver the Air Force this highly capable strategic deterrent. During the quarter, we continued to make significant progress on other key programs as well. On Sentinel, the US Air Force and Northrop Grumman Corporation completed a successful static fire test of the stage one solid rocket motor for the missile in March. This critical milestone for the weapon system further validates the motor's design and paves the way for the production and deployment of a safe, secure, and reliable strategic deterrent. We are also continuing to work with the customer to identify cost and schedule efficiencies. As they evaluate requirements to balance capability, affordability, and schedule for the program. In January, the US Army awarded us a nearly $500 million contract for IBCS. Under this award, Northrop Grumman Corporation will expand software development and include additional AI and model-based systems engineering capabilities. To allow more rapid integration, for the Army, and our international partners. Earlier this month, we announced the opening of a state-of-the-art production and integration facility in Alabama to support accelerated modernization plans for air and missile defense systems, including IBCS. With this investment, it doubles the size of the previous facility footprint, leverages Northrop Grumman Corporation's digital ecosystem, and gives us the ability to scale production, and field new capabilities at speed. Also, we received nearly $300 million in awards in the first quarter from the U.S. Navy to produce two additional Triton aircraft and associated support services. We are also making good progress on delivering Tritons to Australia. The first of four was delivered last year, and the second and third aircraft have completed testing with the US Navy prior to delivery to the Royal Australian Air Force this year. Triton is playing a critical role surveilling high-priority areas of interest in multiple regions. It was just announced last week that Triton will soon be deployed from Southern Japan to commence surveillance and information-gathering operations. I'd like to take the next few minutes to provide our view of the market outlook for both the industry in general and Northrop Grumman Corporation more specifically. For our industry, demand ultimately stems from the global threat environment. Over the past decade, this environment has grown increasingly complex with the reemergence of peer adversaries. Making the pace of innovation and production crucial for deterrence. As a result, our global customers are increasing their investments in national security. In the US, we continue to see signs that defense spending will increase. Driven by a few ongoing developments. The first is the finalization of a continuing resolution for the 2025 defense budget. This CR comes with several provisions that set it apart from previous ones. The most notable of which are an increase in the top line over FY24 and increased flexibility with spending accounts. Meanwhile, there is a push for additional funding through the reconciliation process. Which could add up to $150 billion to the defense budget to be allocated over multiple years. Both the House and the Senate have passed initial legislation that lays the groundwork for this additional funding. We believe much of this will be used to support investments to maintain our nation's edge against evolving global threats. Lastly, the administration continues to prepare their fiscal year 2026 budget request. And we are encouraged by recent commentary that suggests a continued strong commitment to national security funding at levels higher than prior projections. The administration has highlighted key priority areas such as the triad, missile defense, and weapon systems, all of which are aligned to core capabilities of Northrop Grumman Corporation. Additionally, the significant increase in defense investment outside the US is leading to a growing pipeline of requests for our products across Europe, Asia Pacific, and the Middle East. As countries seek to protect their sovereign territories, and deter aggression. In Q1, our international sales represented approximately 14% of total sales. We have broadened our customer base, and increased the number of products that we can sell internationally, and established new partnerships globally to enhance our addressable market. As a result, we continue to see our opportunities to increase our international sales over the coming years. And we are making steady progress in this area. With a first-quarter international book-to-bill of 1.45 times. And international sales up 11% in the quarter. International bookings were driven in part by over a billion dollars in international awards in mission systems. Also in the quarter, Poland signed a $745 million letter of acceptance for 200 Argum ER missiles adding to the growth potential for our defense systems business. We continue to see a broad pipeline of opportunities in the areas of air and missile defense, airborne ISR and C2 systems, and ammunition across multiple markets including newly emerging opportunities in the Middle East. Our strategy is to compete and win in global markets through technology differentiation. Bringing innovation and capability beyond what commercial alternatives can provide. To further our ability to innovate and deliver we invested $13.5 billion in R&D and infrastructure. As a result, we now have the ability to scale, design, and produce while fielding new capabilities at speed. We also have a track record of delivering defense technology that stays ahead of the pacing threats. For example, our technology is inside 90% of US national security space satellites. We're a leader in low observable technology, having produced the first stealth bomber, the B-2, and now its successor, the B-21. We've delivered more than 1.3 million solid rocket motors, and we are a leader in mission systems where we produce over a million secure microchips per year, some of which are a thousand times faster than the microchips in your smartphone. As we look to the future, we are leveraging our own hardware and software capabilities to develop the next generation of systems and we're also partnering with leading companies in areas such as AI. To ensure our customers have the most advanced capabilities. In the world. In conclusion, given our key franchise program, record backlog, strong competitive position, and global market dynamics, we continue to project significant potential ahead. Our focus remains on our strategy of driving innovation, expanding our market presence, and optimizing performance to deliver profitable, sustainable growth. We are committed to our long-term vision of creating value for our shareholders meeting our customer needs, and staying ahead in an ever-evolving global market landscape. So with that, I'm gonna turn the call over to Ken to discuss our first-quarter results and our updated guidance. Ken?
Ken Crews: Thank you, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin by covering our top-line results on slide four in our earnings deck. First-quarter sales were $9.5 billion, down 7% compared to the prior year. And included two fewer working days compared to Q1 2024. Sales in the quarter were also impacted by multiple contracting delays and timing of material receipts. This sales profile was contemplated in our expectations that we shared in February. However, as Kathy outlined, we updated our estimates to complete the LRIP phase of the B-21 program late in the quarter. Lowered sales by nearly $100 million. As a result, Q1 sales were slightly below our expectations, however, we are still on the path to achieve our full-year sales guidance. In total, aeronautic sales were down 8% year over year, due to lower B-21 sales, and timing of production and material on mature programs, including F-35. DS first-quarter sales increased by $68 million or 4% primarily due to the continued ramp on the Sentinel program, and higher volume on certain military ammunition programs. Mission system sales continue to expand up $148 million driven by numerous programs throughout their portfolio. Higher sales on Sabre, EW, international ground-based radar, and marine programs all contributed to the 6% growth. And space sales were lower primarily due to previously communicated wind down of work on two programs. Which totaled approximately $230 million of year-over-year headwinds as well as from lower volume on CRS and FDA satellite programs. Moving to the bottom line. Our first-quarter segment operating income results are shown on slide five. As previously discussed, AS adjusted their estimate to complete the phase of the B-21 program. The total loss provision was $477 million across the five LRIP lots. Which had the effect of lowering our company Q1 segment operating margin rate to 6%. At DS, first-quarter 2025 segment operating income grew by 15%, and their margin rate improved to 9.9%. This improvement was driven by higher volume, improved performance, and an increase in net favorable EACs. Admission systems, quarter one operating margin decreased 4% due to lower volume on certain fixed-price restricted production programs, and investments made in connection with restricted business opportunities. These reductions were partially offset by higher net EAC adjustments. And at Space, first-quarter segment operating income was driven by lower sales volume, partially offset by improved program performance. Notably, Space's net favorable EACs improved to $29 million in Q1, leading to an 11% operating margin rate. Outside of the B-21 adjustment, segment operating income was consistent with the first quarter of 2024 and net favorable EACs were higher by over 30% year over year. This performance is driven by disciplined program execution, our focus on driving cost efficiencies in our business. Moving to year-over-year EPS compare on slide six. Earnings per share were lower primarily due to the adjustment on B-21. Which totaled $2.74 per share, on an after-tax basis. Lower sales volume and as expected higher corporate unallocated expense, also contributed to the combined $0.25 of year-over-year headwind. Before covering our updated guidance for 2025, I want to take a moment to talk about Q1 cash flow. Consistent with our seasonal pattern and expectations, first-quarter results reflected a usage of cash. Operating cash outflow of $1.5 billion reflected an increase in vendor payments as well as lower billings and collections compared to our prior year. We also invested nearly $300 million in capital expenditures during the period. We continue to expect cash flow to gradually ramp throughout the year, with the largest quarter of cash generation in Q4 consistent with our historical performance. And from a capital deployment perspective, we repaid $1.5 billion of notes that matured in January. As we indicated on our Q4 earnings call. We also returned nearly $800 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Turning to company guidance on slide seven. We continue to expect $42 billion to $42.5 billion in 2025 sales. Representing 3% to 4% organic growth. Looking forward, we expect mid-single-digit sequential growth in Q2, followed by a sales ramp in the second half of the year, driven by awards booked in Q4 2024, the timing of subcontractor deliveries and material receipts, as well as from new program awards. With respect to evolving trade policy, the vast majority of our supply chain is sourced from domestic suppliers. After a thorough review of our supply chain, we have a good understanding of the risk areas, and are taking mitigation actions where possible to address them. Full-year segment operating income and EPS guidance have been updated to reflect the B-21 adjustment, also had the effect of lowering our estimated tax rate for the year to high 16%. And we are reaffirming our 2025 free cash flow guidance range of $2.85 billion to $3.25 billion. At the segment level, we are reaffirming our sales expectation at each of our segments. We continue to expect mid-single-digit growth at AS and MS, driven by continued ramp on B-21, TACOMO, and multiple programs across our diverse MS portfolio. We expect DS will achieve double-digit organic sales growth this year, driven by IVCS backlog, Sentinel, and higher volume in our weapons business. The divestiture of the training service business is on track to close midyear. Assume early Q3 for your modeling purposes. And we continue to project space sales of roughly $11 billion enabled by continued production on existing programs and new competitive wins in the restricted domain. We have updated our OM rate expectations at AS, and now expect an OM rate of low to mid-6%. Are reaffirming our margin rate expectations for the other segments, and with each projected to increase from 2024 actual results. We expect a gradual ramp in overall segment margin rates, over the coming quarters driven by MS. This profile is enabled by continued strong program performance, execution of cost-saving initiatives, and seasonal volume shifts to higher margin production programs later in the year. To conclude, our portfolio is well aligned to customer priorities. And we will continue to drive efficiencies manage risk, and elevate performance to deliver profitable growth over the long term. This will enable us to execute our capital deployment strategy, which prioritizes investing in innovation and capacity to meet our customer needs. While returning cash to shareholders. With that, we are ready to begin Q&A.
Operator: Our first question comes from Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.
Kristine Liwag: Hey, good morning, everyone.
Kathy Warden: Good morning, Kristine. Welcome back.
Kristine Liwag: Thank you. So, Kathy, maybe on the B-21, what milestone should we watch for to track the risk retirement of the program? And regarding the macro environment, you put in for the charges, how should we think about this regarding tariffs? Could there be a risk that you could see further charges on the program?
Kathy Warden: Thanks, Kristine. So let me start by talking about the phases of the program and where we are in performance. We are completing the EMD phase of the program, and are in the stages of tests that prove out the objectives of the aircraft being met through those performance test milestones, and the government has released information as we progress through the test program to help provide some transparency that the aircraft is performing in line with the model performance and the test objective. We also have started low-rate initial production, and as we've talked about, we are working through the first two lots of production in LRIP, and we had even started long lead up through lots four. We've built a good bit of experience now in building the aircraft. And as we have progressed through the build process, we made the determination working with the Air Force to reduce risk as we scaled to the program of record which will happen at the end of LRIP, and even to position us now to ramp above the program of record. And those manufacturing changes and associated costs that we talked about being reflected this quarter are results of that learning in the process of scaling. But it's good to have that learning now understood and behind us before we ramp further through LRIP and then eventually into full-rate production. We also have the sustainment and modernization still ahead on the program. We've talked in previous calls about having started some work on modernization and we are building out the capability to train and sustain on the aircraft as well. So those will fit gradually face them over these next several years. And there isn't change based on what we're reporting this quarter in that profile for the program.
Kristine Liwag: Great. Thank you, Kathy. And maybe could follow-up on AI. You mentioned earlier that, you know, you're seeing opportunities there. Can you provide more color on where you see Northrop Grumman Corporation's strategic strengths are in AI versus commercial players or new disruptive players? How much of a game-changer are your capabilities in this?
Kathy Warden: Yes. So we have been investing in artificial intelligence as it's known today. But for decades, we've been incorporating the concepts of distilling large amounts of information through automation into actionable software that helps enable a user to do everything from flying an aircraft with our autonomous aircraft to the billing large amounts of information for targeting to helping to assimilate situational awareness and make decisions on how to pair sensors and shooters like with the IDCS program, which I mentioned in my prepared remarks. All of these applications of artificial intelligence help us to make our sensors, our software more valuable for the user and to do more in short periods of time to prepare that information for the user to act more quickly. And so that is a mission expertise that we possess and the building of that software and the integration of artificial intelligence techniques is something that our team understands how to do. But as that technology matures, we absolutely can partner with other companies who are investing usually for commercial applications and bring their platforms in to facilitate our software development. And that's largely what we're doing in the partnership that we have with companies like NVIDIA.
Kristine Liwag: Great. Thank you very much.
Ken Crews: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. You may proceed.
Robert Stallard: Thanks so much. Good morning.
Kathy Warden: Good morning.
Robert Stallard: Kathy, in your prepared remarks, you noted that it's pretty unstable situation with your US customer at the moment. Did you give us the expectation that you hope things or expect things to improve from here? But some of the commentary from the Pentagon suggested there's gonna be significant head counts, and there's obviously still the potential risk of the doge. So what gives you the confidence that this situation, this process problem is gonna improve from here?
Kathy Warden: Well, thanks, Rob. There definitely is uncertainty in the environment, and it's in multiple forms. The one that I referred to in my prepared remarks was delays in getting new awards and those positions being made. What I would say is we are starting to see those award decisions move forward and that was the reason for my comment that we expect that to improve here in the second quarter and throughout the year. We are not seeing direct impact from the government's reduction of personnel in our ability to still deliver on programs and get through the milestones that we have on program. We are watching that. Certainly, we wanna make sure that the government oversight is sufficient and there, but I also believe there is room for efficiencies and we expect that in some ways, the government will be able to continue their work. Even as they experience less personnel. And finally, I would just say that we are looking towards the budget to provide clarity on the administration's priorities. But what we are hearing is that there is strong alignment to the areas of capability that Northrop Grumman Corporation provides, and we also are expecting the increases in top line that I talked about in my prepared remarks. So we'll be watching all of that closely as it unfolds over the coming months.
Robert Stallard: Okay. Thanks, Kathy. Just a quick one for Ken. On the B-21 EAC adjustment, what's the anticipated cash impact from this? Is it basically the same number but spread over time?
Ken Crews: Yes. So the right way to think about the cash impact due to the incremental charge is no material impact to 2025. Of the incremental charge, it will be spread primarily through 2026, 2027, and 2028.
Robert Stallard: Thank you very much.
Ken Crews: Thank you.
Operator: Next question comes from Ronald Epstein with Bank of America. You may proceed.
Ronald Epstein: Hey. Yeah. Good morning. Yeah. If we dig a little deeper on the B-21. If we peel back the onion, what changed from a quarter ago to now to make you feel like you had to do this now? And I guess that gets at how confident can we be that this is it? Right? I mean, think we've all watched the industry for a while, and it seems like these charges tend to have a tail. And that's the big fear. So are we gonna get one of these every year? I mean, how should we think about it and be confident that this is it?
Kathy Warden: The drivers of the charge were related to a process change and that process change support the accelerated production rates that I referenced. And so in that way, it's a very defined change, and we now understand and have the learning from making that change, and that's not something we will need to do again. This positions us to ramp to the quantities needed in full-rate production. And even as I noted, we can ramp beyond the quantity in the program of record, which is something that we and the government decided was important. For the optionality, to support the scenarios that they have been looking at to increase the current bill rate. The second part of the charge that I mentioned is related to the quantity of general procurement materials as well as the price. And there, we had underestimated the amount of consumption of those materials as well as the price increase that we are seeing. And so in many ways, this is a reflection of the macroeconomic environment coupled with the learning that comes through building the aircraft now having multiple under our belt and the adjustment this quarter has the benefit now of having those first two lots progressing through production. So we don't expect these learning to repeat themselves. But, of course, we've been transparent that there remain both risks and opportunities on the program as we complete the first five LRIPs. Most of the change that we have experienced and that have resulted in now the close to $2 billion of charges on the program are due to inflationary factors and so we have done our best to execute well on what we can control and at the same time reflect both macroeconomic risks in our EAC. So we have updated those. But we will continue to monitor and mitigate those inflationary pressures as we experience them.
Ronald Epstein: Got it. Got it. And then maybe as a follow-up on Sentinel, you know, it's another program that's kinda made some headlines. How confident should we feel about the profitability on that given the potential changes to that program?
Kathy Warden: On Sentinel, we continue to progress well through the development phase of the program, and we as I said, have progressed in design maturity and even testing of the missile. And so we continue to grow in confidence in the design of the system that we are building. We are partnering with DOD and the Air Force to restructure the program. And as part of that restructuring, we are working with the Air Force on options to reduce the overall cost and schedule on the program and have identified opportunities to them to do so. What we look at in that restructuring is to ensure that the changes in requirements are adequately reflected in the design and ultimately in the contract and we'll be working to do that with the government. And I will just remind you that Sentinel is a cost-plus program, and we have not yet estimated the cost associated with LRIP from a contractual standpoint.
Ronald Epstein: Got it. Alright. Thank you very much.
Kathy Warden: Yep.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. You may proceed.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Good morning, Kathy and Ken. And Todd. Maybe just a broader question again starting out with tariffs because it's been a hot topic this morning. How do we think about the tariff impact on the overall Northrop Grumman Corporation portfolio and just international relationships how that changes your potential opportunity set under the current administration.
Kathy Warden: So Sheila, let me start with what we believe to be the impact of tariffs on our portfolio. We do direct source a small part of our supply chain, about 5% of our total spend, so less than a billion dollars annually. And it's from countries out of the US, primarily in Europe. When we look at the second and third tiers of our supply chain, we have purchasing agreements in place. With the vast majority of those that extend over a long period of time. And we have done an assessment and believe that most of the costs that we might incur due to trade policy are incorporated and covered under our contracts with the US government. So we do not see at this point in time a significant risk to our company related to the trade policies as we understand them today. We're gonna continue to monitor that closely, and we're already taking action to account for and mitigate the risk that we do see, particularly in the availability of certain components that we need for delivering on our program.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Great. And maybe if I could ask one specific twelve point nine percent in the quarter. They lag the midpoint of your guidance of mid-fourteens. How do we think about the drivers of that? You mentioned investments and mix of microelectronics. So how do we think about the improvement in MS profitability?
Ken Crews: Sure. Thanks for the question, Sheila. So as we mentioned in my prepared remarks, we made an investment that would generate significant value over the long term. While we're paying the initial investment cost plus our required rate. Return. That was known. So we knew of that we put our guidance forward at the mid fourteen percent range. So as we think forward with mission systems, what is driving the margin profile in the future is the ramp particularly on their mature accretive margin programs throughout the year. As well as mission systems is making significant progress on efficiencies in the business. And so as we harvest those efficiencies, it will impact our rates, which then, you know, flow through to the programs driving that improved margin profile in the second half of the year.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Thank you.
Ken Crews: Thank you.
Operator: Next question comes from Scott Deuschle with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.
Scott Deuschle: Hey. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Ken, are you reiterating the previous free cash flow targets for 2026, 2027, and 2028?
Ken Crews: Yes. So let me touch on that. We are, at this moment, holding the guidance ranges that we provided or the multiyear guidance ranges for cash flow. And we are absolutely focused on performance and rationalizing investment to execute within those ranges, Scott.
Scott Deuschle: Okay. And 2028, still good for the four billion?
Ken Crews: Yes. At this point, we're holding all guidance.
Scott Deuschle: Okay. And then just on this, for 2026 and 2027, would it be reasonable to think that you're biased toward the lower end of the prior range given these B-21 costs or rather mitigating offsets that we should be mindful of?
Ken Crews: Permite is the majority of the impact is 2026, 2027, and 2028, but I wanna highlight the fact that we are over those periods. Right? When we put the ranges together, we account for various risks and be within those ranges. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. You may proceed.
Seth Seifman: Hey, thanks very much and good morning.
Kathy Warden: Good morning.
Seth Seifman: Yeah. Not sure how specific as possible to get on B-21, but if we think about the you know, quantifying the portion of the charge related to the process charge versus the portion related to higher cost. And also would the process charge have been made if there was not an intention to create some optionality about moving to a higher production rate.
Kathy Warden: So, Seth, I can't quantify because of the classification of the program what relates exactly to the process change versus the procurement material. But the first is larger than the second, which is why from a disclosure, we talk about them in that order. And in response to your question of whether we would have made that process change, if not for the need to reduce risk, as we scale to the program of record and then ultimately to position us to grow beyond the program of record, we would not have made those changes at this time if not for those considerations. But we are glad that we have made them. Because that learning only would have compounded if we would have waited later in the program and had a higher production volume. We also believe that providing this optionality to the government now as they are looking at force structure was an important enabler to their derisking of options beyond the program of record. So I don't at all regret that we did this and that we did it now. And it is a good thing for the program overall to have this learning behind us.
Seth Seifman: Okay. Great. I'll leave it there for this morning. Thanks very much.
Kathy Warden: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Ciarmoli with Truist Securities. You may proceed.
Michael Ciarmoli: Hi, Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just hate to do it, but to stay on the B-21. What Kathy, what's the process change at the request of the customer working with them to ramp faster and ultimately to deliver above the current stated volume. And then, you know, just on the consumption of the material, was that you know I think you called out that you were you had more consumption of material. Was that more just kinda thinking about scrap and waste in the process?
Kathy Warden: Yes. So we did make the decision joint with the Air Force to make the process changes. And as I said, it really was to reduce risk as we scaled to the program of record and to provide for options beyond the program of record. The Air Force is continuing to evaluate those options and we'll look for more information as the budget request is finalized. In part of your question, you also are asking about whether we saw some of the material costs increases as a result of scrap and rework, to some degree, it's really about the consumption of the material necessary in the build process, but some of that absolutely is the amount of scrap and waste that we have in the process and the estimate that we made on that early in the program versus the actual performance.
Michael Ciarmoli: Got it. Helpful. And just if I may, I think previously you called out maybe $200 million in supply costs that have been removed. I mean, how are you thinking about that number maybe with the evolution of tariffs and, you know, potentially tighter access to materials. Does that $200 million in cost continue to stay out of the system, you think?
Kathy Warden: So we've talked about $200 million enterprise-wide of cost efficiencies, and we do see a path to keep that cost out of the system and continue to build on it. We are driving cost out not just through supplier engagement in constructing more efficient supplier utilization and pricing, but also through things like facility optimization, the implementation of our digital ecosystem, which is driving rework out of our system. And so those things are the bigger driver of that $200 million cost efficiency. But, certainly, supplier efficiency is part of it, and we don't expect that to be impacted by tariff.
Michael Ciarmoli: Great. Guys. Appreciate it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Doug Harned with Bernstein. You may proceed.
Doug Harned: Thank you. Good morning. Good morning. On the B-21, if we look beyond the five initial LRIPs here, I guess, first, the changes that you're talking about and the costs that are coming through. Should we expect any impact in the next nineteen airplanes, which you've talked about before? And then also as you think about the larger program of record, I mean, the Air Force has talked about a hundred airplanes, but I have to if I think back, I can't remember in the last thirty years that we saw a major aircraft procurement program actually end up increasing beyond the initial program of record. So is there somewhere we would we would see that? Are there have there been announcements, or should we expect something in the budget?
Kathy Warden: Yes, Doug. So let me answer the first part of your question. First about the NTE units. So bottom line upfront, we continue to expect the NTE aircraft to be profitable. The loss largely relates to those higher manufacturing costs that I talked about from the process change we made. And that near-term disruption and the associated costs will not extend into the unit, and we actually expect these changes will positively impact our ability to deliver the NTE units profitably. The increases in projected cost and quantity of general procurement materials could negatively affect the profitability of the unit. So when you think of the NTE aircraft overall, we do still expect those to be profitable. With regards to the Air Force messaging around increasing the quantity of B-21 and potentially the rate at which they are being built. That has been spoken about in congressional testimony, particularly from the users of B-21, think the combatant command that is looking toward what they would like to have for completing their mission and their cab been discussions about raising the quantity. And so that's is the source that you can look to in open source to reflect that increased demand signal that we've been talking about.
Doug Harned: And then just as a follow-on, switching over to defense systems. You've talked about IVCS and ten billion dollar potential international demand. Can you talk about how that's proceeding and how you see that now? When do we should see that impact? So it seems quite substantial and positive.
Kathy Warden: Yes. IVCS is being fielded for the US Army in including expansion of the mission to include the defense of Guam, We also have Poland, as you know, that is expanding their use of IBCS. We first started with their mid-range air defense, and now we're moving to their near-range air defense. And we've talked before about a dozen countries who have expressed interest in procuring IDCS that are in various stages of maturity in the pipeline. But we are seeing great interest there and we continue to add additional countries that are looking to IVCS as the baseline for their architecture. We also, as we have responded to Golden Dome, request for information, incorporated the capability of IBCS, because its ability to integrate sensors and shooters. Is absolutely at the core of part of the underlayer for missile defense. For the homeland in the US as well.
Doug Harned: Very good. Thank you.
Ken Crews: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matt Akers with Wells Fargo. You may proceed.
Matt Akers: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for the Kathy, you had mentioned at a conference in the quarter that there had been, you know, some instances of contracts maybe taking a little bit longer to get signed during the quarter. Could you give us kind of a quick update to that? Is that something you're still seeing or is that dynamic improved a little bit?
Kathy Warden: We have not seen those contracts get awarded yet. We are seeing them progress through the process of being reviewed and we hope ultimately decided and communicated. So we are holding to the expectation that we will see some of those awards start to happen this quarter and certainly in the second half of the year.
Matt Akers: Yeah. Got it. And I guess any color you can add on what those contracts are specifically? Is that focused on one area of your business? Or, I guess, just anything else you can share?
Kathy Warden: Sure. They're actually examples in all four segments of our business. Large aircraft program, in our aeronautics business, multiple space awards, in restricted, particularly communications, We have in mission system some restricted opportunities that we are anticipating will get awarded over the summer now. And in defense, it's largely munitions where we have a munitions contract we expected award in the first quarter and now are expecting to happen in the second or third quarter.
Matt Akers: Got it. Okay. Thanks. I'll leave it there.
Ken Crews: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Myles Walton with Wolfe Research. You may proceed.
Myles Walton: Thanks. Maybe for Ken. I'm not sure. In January, I know you were looking for flat year-on-year sales growth in the quarter, and then in February, you updated that and then you came in below it. And I hear you on the EAC for the B-21. And you sort of alluded to some slowing progress in getting orders under contract. But doesn't sound like those orders are under contract yet, and you're looking for another decline year-on-year in the second quarter. So I guess what gives the confidence for that mid-teens acceleration you need in the second half of the year if bookings aren't in your hand and you've kind of seen what you've seen in the first quarter?
Ken Crews: Yeah. And so thank you for the question. I'll put it into three buckets in terms of what's driving the ramp in terms of the second half of the year. The first one is the large awards we received at the end of 2024, and those fall in the lines of TACIMO and IVCS. As well as international activities early around ground-based radars. Again, I'll reemphasize that in our backlog. And so just from a natural timing progression when you think about ramp up in timing of materials that will happen in the second half of the year. And then when we think about the natural as part of our original assumptions in terms of just our current backlog growing, we had planned ramps of grocery restricted airborne sensors. We got planned ramps in terms of just timing on Sentinel our weapon systems across multiple activities like Argon, a stand-in attack weapon, as well as timing on strike, and that's just a few examples. And, again, that sales growth is driven by backlog. And then the other piece would be, which is primarily space, is new competitive awards. And we do expect we believe we're well-positioned for those and we do expect to hear about those in the second quarter, and then that's what drives the remaining piece of the growth profile.
Myles Walton: Okay. So it wasn't anything in the quarter that was turned off. There was no stop works or customer decision points that were turned off. It was simply a timing of receipt of contracts.
Ken Crews: Yes. And it's just timing. And then around the confidence pieces, when we think about it from a working capital in our inventory, once those get awarded, we are able to reduce that working capital. So it's associated sales real-time. Which also gives us confidence in our profile.
Myles Walton: Okay. Alright. Thank you.
Ken Crews: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ken Herbert with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed.
Ken Herbert: Yeah. Hi. Good morning.
Kathy Warden: Good morning.
Ken Herbert: Kathy. You called out I think, 14% of sales internationally in the first quarter. With all the strong bookings, are you how should we think about now maybe any upward momentum on international either as a mix in 2025 or just absolute growth off those sales this year?
Kathy Warden: We are starting to see a significant pipeline of demand translate into firm international bookings. I did talk about our international sales being up 11% in the quarter. Perhaps even more, interesting for the long term is that our book-to-bill 2024 was 1.4 times than it was 1.45 times. In the first quarter. So we see it coming across a number of areas. We've talked already about ID and the dozen or so countries that are expressing interest. We didn't talk as much, but certainly significant interest in Argum and stand-in attack weapon, both Argum and Argum extended range have been approved for export. To a large number of countries, and we are in various processes of getting those awards on contract. I mentioned one in my prepared remarks. And then we also are continuing to see growth on aircraft platforms like E-2D and Triton. So it's broad-based in terms of where that international business is coming from. And, yeah, we see a significant portion of it in our defense systems business. They have had double-digit growth in international, and with the pipeline that we have and their portfolio in particular, we expect that to continue.
Ken Herbert: Have your thank you. Have your assumptions at all changed on F-35 international sales this year into 2026 as a result of any of the more recent commentary on that program?
Kathy Warden: Our expectations have not changed. The communications that we have had with the Prime are to continue producing at our max rate, which is 156 aircraft. That's what we're on contract to do, and so that's what we continue to do. And so we don't anticipate any change.
Ken Crews: Great. Thank you.
Ken Herbert: Thank you.
Operator: Next question comes from David Strauss with Barclays. You may proceed.
David Strauss: Thanks. Good morning. Good morning. Kathy, one follow-up on B-21 and then one follow-up to that. On B-21, this process change, that you've put in place to allow for accelerated production or higher clients, whatever it may be. Isn't this something the Air Force should pay for, and will they ultimately pay for it? It's just they can't pay for it given the current contract structure that you're working under. That's my first one. And then second one, if you could NGAD F-47, could you talk about what role, if any, you have on the Boeing aircraft? Thanks.
Kathy Warden: Sure. So, look, we made the decision jointly with the Air Force to make the change, and we believe in the long run, it's not only in the best interest of national security and providing the Department of Defense the options that they need to have a force structure that meets their expanding requirements, but also for the profitability of the program over the long haul. And that's the decision framework that we operate within is to think about what is needed by the nation and our shareholders not just each quarter, but over the long duration that this program will be adding value. In regard to our role on NGAD, given the classification of the program, we can't disclose any information specific to the program, but you know that we are a merchant supplier of mission systems, and we remain fully committed to supplying those advanced capabilities for government customers and prime. And that our sensors are easily scaled and reconfigurable. For a wide application across a variety of platforms and domains. And, you know, simply leave it at that.
David Strauss: Okay. And any update on timing on FAXX?
Kathy Warden: We I do not have an update to provide you. The Navy remains committed to the program, and we do expect to hear something soon.
David Strauss: Great. Very much.
Ken Crews: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from Scott Mikus with MELIUS Research. You may proceed.
Scott Mikus: Morning. Cash, quick question. Defense Systems, it looks like there was an explosion at a plant in Utah. That produces solid rocket motors. So I'm just wondering how you're thinking about that in terms of the outlook at the yes. Is there any potential impact to stand and attack weapon or Argum ER?
Kathy Warden: Yes. Thank you for the question. It is actually part of our space business. This is where we build the larger solid rocket motors, not the tactical ones that go into missiles. And so it was in Promontory, Utah. And it was a building that where we produced an ingredient to our solid rocket motor propellant but we have other sources of supply outside of Northrop Grumman Corporation that will be able to provide us that ingredient. So we do not expect any impact to any of our programs. We've specifically been asked about Sentinel because Promontory is a production site for those solid rocket motors, and there is not expected to be any impact to Sentinel or any other program. And, again, it would be in our space business, not defense systems. So there's absolutely no correlation to programs like Argum, Argum ER, or Stanton weapons.
Scott Mikus: Okay. Very helpful. Second question, DOD has highlighted a lot of need for investment in space. So is there a possibility that the classified space program that was canceled could end up being restarted under this new administration?
Kathy Warden: You know, certainly, the requirements are what drive the need for development and fielding of capabilities. And so to the extent that the requirement has not gone away, we do believe that programs could be reevaluated and started under this administration to meet those requirements. Our current year expectations don't reflect that, but certainly, we continue to provide information to the government to help them understand their options for meeting those requirements.
Scott Mikus: Thanks for taking my questions. Sure.
Operator: Alright. We're gonna have to leave it there.
Kathy Warden: Great. Well, let me wrap up by thanking you for participation in today's call. As you sensed, we are optimistic about the continued strong demand for our products, the growing global defense budgets that we see, and the solid execution of our team across the majority of the business. And while we are disappointed with the B-21 adjustment this quarter, the underlying business fundamentals in our company are strong. And we continue to derisk the B-21 program through the investments that we're making. So for the remainder of the year, we're gonna continue to focus on adding to our backlog, improving profitability in our business segments, and generating the cash that fuels our deployment plan. Look forward to giving you another update in the second quarter, and wanna thank you again for joining today's call.
Ken Crews: Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2024 Q4  (2025-01-30 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's Fourth Quarter 2024 Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. My name is Josh, and I will be your operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Todd Ernst, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Ernst, please proceed.
Todd Ernst: Thanks, Josh, and good morning everyone, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's fourth quarter 2024 conference call. Before we start, due to technical issues with our provider, we have provided a new dial-in information for the analysts. So, please use that to dial into the call. Moving on, matters discussed on today's call, including guidance and outlooks for 2025 and beyond reflect the company's judgment based on information available at the time of this call. They constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, including those noted in today's press release and our SEC filing. These risks and uncertainties may cause actual company results to differ materially. Today's call will include non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to our GAAP results in our earnings release. In addition, we'll refer to a presentation that is posted to our Investor Relations website. On the call today are Kathy Warden, our Chair, CEO, and President, and Ken Crews, our CFO. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kathy. Kathy?
Kathy Warden: Thanks, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. At Northrop Grumman, we remain steadfast in our mission to innovate and deliver cutting-edge technologies that enhance national security for the U.S. and our allies. We are harnessing our investments to manufacture at scale the integrated hardware and software solutions that give our customers an advantage. Our strategy, which is based on technology differentiation, has resulted in another year of strong financial performance. We set a new record backlog, including significant new competitive wins and follow-on awards. We ended the year with a backlog of approximately $91.5 billion and a book-to-bill ratio at 1.23 times, providing a solid foundation for future growth. This was driven, in part, by a new competitive win on the TACOMO program, and an award for the second LRIP lot on B-21 in the fourth quarter. Over the past three years, our book-to-bill is 1.15 times, reflecting strong ongoing demand for our capabilities across U.S. and international markets. In the fourth quarter, we also booked $900 million for the next iteration of Poland's IBCS system, bringing our international book-to-bill ratio for the year to 1.4 times. Given this strong demand, we now expect our international business to accelerate and grow faster than U.S. sales in 2025. Our proven ability to grow backlog and deliver key capabilities to our customers has led to another year of strong top line growth, with 2024 sales up more than 4%, building on the momentum over the last five years, where our top line has grown by 30% organically. Meanwhile, our focus on performance and driving efficiencies in our business is leading to margin expansion, with segment operating margin dollars growing faster than sales. And our free cash flow performance for the year was outstanding, increasing 25% year-over-year to over $2.6 billion at the high-end of our guidance range. As we look forward, our guidance reflects our expectation for continued solid organic growth of 3% to 4%, further segment margin expansion, and double-digit free cash flow growth again in 2025. This guidance is consistent with the outlook we provided you in October. At Northrop Grumman, our portfolio is well-positioned to provide critical deterrence capabilities and differentiating technology that address peer threats and achieve the shared goals of equipping the world's greatest military, reaching new frontiers in space, and improving the ways industry and government do business. We look forward to partnering with the Trump administration to accomplish these objectives. We expect Congress to complete FY'25 appropriations this spring, which is assumed in our guidance. As discussions continue regarding the U.S. defense budget and potential additional investments, we continue to see strong bipartisan support for national security. And global defense budgets are growing as our allies seek to counter aggression from increasingly sophisticated threats. This is driving an increase in demand, particularly in areas such as crewed and uncrewed aircraft, advanced weapons, and missile defense. These dynamics give us confidence in our strong international growth outlook. At our core, we are a technology company, and we are well-positioned on programs that are essential to the U.S. and our allies' national security. More than just an integrator, we possess technology depth throughout Northrop Grumman, not only in what we produce, but in how we produce it. This combination allows us to compete and win on priority programs, and support our customers' goals of peace through strength. One example is our government-trusted design and development of specialized microelectronics for the Department of Defense through our accredited foundry. In our microelectronic center, we build on our past to innovate for the future, and continually disrupt our own technology to bring unmatched capabilities to the U.S. military. Our terahertz microchip, which operates at one trillion cycles per second, is the fastest in the world, according to the Guinness World Record. This type of innovation is realized through material science, new hardware design and manufacturing techniques, and advanced software development. All capabilities that we have built and refined over time and possess at scale so we can deliver for our customers' most challenging missions. As a result of having this capability, our microelectronics business grew over 20% in 2024. And equally important, it creates competitive advantages for Northrop Grumman by providing mission-critical technologies that flow upward through our value chain, are married with Mission-IS software, and then are designed into product areas such as sensors, communications, processing, and security solutions. We deliver these game-changing capabilities as a prime contractor on platforms we build and also offer them as a trusted supplier to other platform manufacturers. As technological change accelerates, it becomes more important that we continue to deliver technology discriminators, whether that's tying together capabilities for family of system solutions or developing additional use cases for our missionized AI that enhance our solutions or accelerate decision-making. We are leveraging our own hardware and software and also partnering with leading companies in areas such as AI to ensure our customers have the most advanced equipment in the world. Innovation and having the capabilities to meet our customer needs are important. But the ability to scale production and field new systems at speed are core to ultimate mission success. As we've grown our capacity, we've also been implementing advanced manufacturing techniques, automation, and digital factories across our company. We are designing, manufacturing, and sustaining our next generation systems with digital ecosystems that are improving our agility and efficiency and therefore lowering our costs and time to field. These new manufacturing technologies, along with the capacity investments we've made, enable us to rapidly ramp production. We've done this in areas like solid rocket motors, advanced weapons, and satellite manufacturing. And these investments also allow us to more seamlessly transition major programs from design to production, like we've done with the B-21, all of which have been and will continue to be important drivers of growth for our company. Next, I'd like to update you on the plans we've previously shared to drive margin expansion. We continue to expect favorable mix to be a driver as we ramp on production programs and grow our international sales over the next several years. Beyond this, we are taking proactive actions to drive efficiencies across the company. These actions include implementation of digital tool sets that reduce process time, automate tasks, and maximize output for our technical team. We're streamlining our organizational structure, optimizing our supply chain spend, and reducing costs through improved utilization of our resources and facilities. We removed over $200 million of cost in the enterprise in 2024 alone. We have a laser focus on performance excellence, driven by delivering first-time quality and robust risk management processes. Altogether, these cost efficiency initiatives, mixed shifts, and focus on performance give us confidence we can reduce costs to the taxpayer, while also enhancing segment margins as we progress through this decade. This margin expansion coupled with continued growth in our business and reduced capital investment are the drivers of our multi-year free cash flow growth outlook. We continue to pursue a balanced capital deployment strategy that supports our customers' requirements and returns cash to shareholders. Over the past two years, we've invested over $3.5 billion in CapEx to expand our capacity and implement the advanced manufacturing lines across our company. And we are planning to invest another $1.5 billion in 2025. We've also delivered over 100% of free cash flow to shareholders last year. We continue to believe we have the best portfolio that is aligned to our customers' highest priority mission. However, as we always do, we continuously evaluate the portfolio to ensure that we are investing in the businesses that are core to achieving our strategic vision. This includes accessing any gaps that may emerge over time or businesses that may make sense to exit. With this in mind, we've decided to exit our training services business that is part of defense system segment. Today, we announced that we have signed an agreement to sell the business to Serco, Inc. for $327 million, and we forecast this transaction to close toward the middle of the year. This is an important capability for our customers, and we expect the team to continue to deliver world-class training services under new leadership, allowing us to focus on our core business. 2024 was marked by strong program execution, compelling financial performance, implementation of operational improvements, and impactful strategic initiatives that have positioned us for long-term success. Our ability to capitalize on opportunities and deliver exceptional results is a direct testament to the hard work and dedication of every member of our company. Our strategic priorities remain focused on fostering innovation, enhancing operational excellence, and expanding our impact for our customers. So, with that, I'll turn the call over to Ken to discuss our fourth quarter and full-year financial results, as well as our 2025 guidance. Ken?
Ken Crews: Thank you, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. As Kathy outlined, we delivered another strong year of financial performance in 2024, delivering on or exceeding the financial commitments that we communicated a year ago. This sustained performance is a reflection of our strategic positioning, continued focus on operational excellence, and disciplined approach to financial management. We continue to see robust and enduring demand for our capabilities in both domestic and international markets. Reflecting this demand, we booked $17.3 billion in new awards in the fourth quarter and approximately $51 billion for the full-year. This led to a record backlog of over $91 billion, an increase of 9% compared to last year, positioning the company for continued growth. Moving to top line, we generated sales of $10.7 billion in quarter four and $41 billion for the year. 2024 sales increased by 4.4% with growth across three of our four businesses. Transitioning to segment performance, NGAS grew to $12 billion in 2024, an increase of 12% compared to the prior year. Sales volume increased throughout the portfolio and was driven by the production ramp on B-21 and from higher activity on the F-35 program. Sales were also higher on autonomous programs, such as Triton and Global Hawk, and we saw higher volume on E2 sustainment and modernization work. DS posted sales growth of 3%, driven by higher sales on Sentinel, advanced weapons, and ammunition programs, partially offset by lower volume due to the completion of an international training program. Mission system sales increased by 5%, led by higher volume on advanced and microelectronics and technology programs, and in the space segment, 2024 sales were down modestly, as expected, compared to the prior year due to the wind down of a restrictive program in NGI. As we previously stated, the remaining space portfolio grew at mid-single digits in 2024, driven by higher sales on Space Development Agency satellite programs and numerous other programs. Turning to the bottom line, 2024 segment operating income was over $4.5 billion, and our segment operating margin rate expanded to 11.1%. Margins improved due to the proactive steps we've taken to further enhance performance and drive efficiencies across our business, as Kathy described earlier in the call. This performance led to an increase in net favorable earnings adjustments, totaling $350 million for the year. Strong segment performance was the driver for higher year-over-year earnings per share, as shown on slide six in our earnings deck. 2024 mark-to-market adjusted EPS was $26.08 and exceeded the high-end of our guidance range provided in October. Higher net pension income and a lower share count also provided an uplift. Moving to cash, we had an excellent quarter of cash generation in Q4, as is our historical pattern. Our full-year operating cash flow was $4.4 billion, and we invested roughly $1.8 billion in capital expenditures. This resulted in over $2.6 billion in 2024 free cash flow, near the high-end of our guidance range, and up a notable 25% compared to 2023. Next, I would like to provide an update on our pension results and multi-year estimates. Asset returns in 2024 were 4.7%, below our long-term expected rate of return of 7.5%. Meanwhile, the FAS discount rate increased by roughly 60 basis points to 5.73%; more than offsetting the impact from lower asset returns. The net result, along with updated census data, is a 2024 mark-to-market after-tax benefit of $332 million, or $2.26 a share. Looking forward, these results translate to slightly higher expected CAS recoveries and a reduced FAS pension benefit, lowering overall net pension income compared to the prior outlook. Importantly, our pension plans remain fully funded, and we continue to project minimal cash pension contributions over the next several years. Before covering our 2025 guidance, I'll highlight recent changes to our portfolio. In addition to the upcoming divestiture of the training services business, which has an annual run rate of $300 million in sales, the strike and surveillance aircraft services business unit has been realigned from defense systems to aeronautic systems, effective January 1st of this year. This business provides a variety of support and sustainment activities, primarily on aircraft programs in our AS portfolio. This now aligns the full product life cycles of Northrop Grumman aircraft, allowing for more seamless development and sustainment of next generation aircraft. These actions, coupled with the completion of an international training program, create a portfolio at DS that is now centered around strategic deterrence, advanced weapons, and missile defense. Fourth quarter and 2024 results have been reported in the prior organization structure, and we've provided a few tables in our earnings release and slide deck that recast sales and margins for current and historical periods. Moving forward, we'll report first quarter 2025 results and beyond in the new structure. And our 2025 segment guidance also reflects the new structure inclusive of the divestiture. Turning to 2025, our segment guidance is included on slide eight in our earnings deck. Aeronautic sales are expected to be in the low $13 billion, representing mid-single-digit growth. This includes nearly 400 million of sales from the realignment previously mentioned. Aeronautics margins are expected in the mid to high 9% range and reflect higher sales on the LRIP phase of B-21. 2025 DS sales are projected in the low eight billions. We expect DS to be our fastest growing business in 2025. With double-digit organic sales growth driven by higher sales on Sentinel, IBCS, and our diverse weapons portfolio. Segment operating margin at DS is expected to grow faster than sales, with an OM rate of mid to high 9%. Sales at mission systems are projected to grow mid-single digits again in 2025, with sales reaching approximately $12 billion. And operating margins are expected to expand approximately 50 basis points to mid-14% as productivity initiatives continue to drive improved performance. We expect sales in the space segment of roughly $11 billion, reflecting a year-over-year headwind of $900 million from the wind down of our work on the restricted space and NGI programs. And we expect an OM rate of high 10% at space ahead of where we ended 2024. At the company level, our 2025 guidance is consistent with the outlook we provided on our Q3 call. Full-year sales are expected to grow 3% to 4% on an organic basis with first quarter sales and margins comparable to Q1 of last year. Keep in mind, the first quarter year-over-year company sales growth will be flat due to the program wind-downs in space with a majority of the year-over-year growth occurring in the second-half of the year. Full-year segment margins are projected to expand roughly 10 basis points, with margins also ramping throughout the year. This year-over-year expansion is driven by the continuation of our efficiency andproductivity initiatives, as well as international growth. Our guidance for mark-to-market adjusted EPS is $28.05 at the midpoint, up more than 7% year-over-year. Next, I want to take a moment to highlight several contributing factors to this outlook. First, the FAS/CAS pension adjustment is projected at 800 million, down 60 million compared to our prior outlook in Q3. Second, we are projecting corporate unallocated expenses of $280 million this year, up compared to our 2024 results and reflective of a normalized level of recurring expenses. The primary drivers of the reduced 2024 expense were state tax and environmental related benefits that are not expected to recur in 2025. Third, we expect a pretax gain from the training service divestiture of $205 million which will also flow through corporate unallocated. Our 2025 estimated tax rate is projected at low to mid 17% and we are reaffirming our 2025 free cash flow guidance range of greater than 15% growth at the midpoint. Speaking of cash, due to our strong performance in 2024, we ended the year with a cash balance of nearly $4.4 billion. In early January, we repaid $1.5 billion of notes that matured. This year, our investments in R&D and CapEx are projected at over $2.5 billion and we expect to return 100% of our free cash flow to investors. As we look ahead, there are many opportunities in front of us. The foundation we have built sets the stage for continued growth and value creation. Our investments in advanced technologies, forward-thinking strategies and disciplined financial management ensure we are well prepared to capitalize on emerging opportunities. I'm confident that together, we will continue to deliver outstanding results for all of our stakeholders. With that, let's open the call to questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ronald Epstein with Bank of America. You may proceed.
Ronald Epstein: Hey, good morning. So, there's been a lot of talk lately about an Iron Dome. Given the kind of work that you guys do both in space and in missile protection and so on and so forth, missile defense, can you give us any thoughts on how you're thinking about Iron Dome?
Kathy Warden: Yes. Thanks, Ron. So, we welcome the urgency that the Trump administration is placing on protecting the homeland from escalating global missile threats. We think it is very timely. And as you've noted, we do offer end-to-end integrated air and missile defense capabilities. Just a few examples that might be relevant to a U.S. Iron Dome include capabilities that can disrupt missile launch. So, this is capability left of launch. We also have satellite-based missile detection and tracking, and we have interceptors for hypersonic weapons under development. And this, of course, is all in addition to the air and missile defense command and control systems that we build. So, when you think about an architecture to defense the U.S., particularly with the range that these missiles will need and the advanced threats that are emerging with hypersonic weapons, we think we're very well-positioned to support that architecture.
Ronald Epstein: Got it, got it. And then, maybe just one quick follow on. When we think about growth in 2025, how much of a contributor is B-21 and GBSD?
Kathy Warden: Both will contribute to growth in 2025. Both are more modest than the growth rates that they've experienced in the past just because of the place that they are in their life cycle. And so, we do continue to expect both to be less than 10% of sales in the company, but continuing to gradually increase from '24 into 25.
Ronald Epstein: Great, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Deuschle with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.
Scott Deuschle: Hey, good morning.
Kathy Warden: Good morning.
Scott Deuschle: Kathy, if the Air Force were to elect to accelerate production on B-21, would the incremental units that get accelerated have similar unit pricing as the existing aircraft in those lots, or would that be more of an open negotiation for any accelerated units?
Kathy Warden: We would work with the Air Force to look at when those units would come into the contract. And obviously, we are accumulating more and more actual performance to help inform discussions with them about the right pricing. So, it would be premature for me to comment on where we expect that to land, but it would be a discussion.
Scott Deuschle: Okay. And then, Ken, the guide imply some pretty solid margin expansion in Mission Systems? Maybe you could talk a little bit through the specific drivers that are supporting that margin expansion? Thank you.
Ken Crews: Thanks for the question, Scott. And as you mentioned, when we looked into in 2025, the expansion of margin in Mission Systems is about 50 basis points, really proud of the Mission Systems team. Particularly, if you look at 2024, we had, as we scaled the business initial headwinds in Q2 and if you look at their performance since Q2, it's grown and they have done exceptionally well, ending the year with a 14.9% booking rate in quarter four. As we look forward, we're continuing to see the performance improvements driven by multiple factors. It's continuing to drive cost out of the business, leveraging the improvements that we made in our factories. As we progress and the business has scaled, we have made sure that we've developed our team in terms of being able to operate in a more effective and efficient manner as we produce those products. And then, obviously, the various digital technologies and the focus on cost reductions. If you look at Mission Systems, they have focused on reduced costs and even as a percentage of G&A, we're seeing it continuously reduce. And so, those are some of the primary drivers that give us confidence in terms of their ability to expand margins in '25.
Scott Deuschle: Great, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. You may proceed.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Good morning and thank you. Kathy, I think you called out in your script $900 million of headwind from MTI and classified when it comes to space, implies rest of the business is growing 2%. How are you thinking about just growth from LEO, GEO, NASA programs? And as a follow-up to that, when does the segment return to margin expansion or growth?
Ken Crews: So, in terms of margin expansion, I'll take your second question first with space is, as you've seen year-over-year significant improvements when we think about earnings adjustments from what we saw in 2023 to 2024 and that's focused on the performance element and then driving efficiencies and reduced costs. And we continue to expect that focus and improvements from those efficiency initiatives. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks is, we do expect space to continue to expand margins and delivering 2025 above what they delivered in 2024 at the high 10% range. And in terms of what's driving space overall growth is we do have, I just want to clarify the $1.5 billion of 2025 sales that became a headwind with about $600 million in '24 with $900 million in '25. That $900 million is primarily focused on the first-half of the year and we expect space to contribute to growth or return to growth towards the end of 2025 and then continue that expansion into 2026. The primary drivers of driving the growth overall is strategic comps, restricted space, the continued expansion of propulsion systems is what's driving that growth.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Douglas Harned with Bernstein. You may proceed.
Douglas Harned: Very good. Thank you. Good morning. On Defense Systems, you've made a number of changes there. Kathy, could you describe what we should think of as Defense Systems sort of the theme there? In other words, it's much different than it was just a year ago. What are you trying to do with that segment?
Kathy Warden: Yes. So, we have transitioned that segment over the course of the last year with the divestiture of training services and the movement of the sustainment portfolio into our AS business. Defense Systems now is largely a strategic missiles, tactical weapons and command and control business. And so, that aligns their customer focus more simply it also creates synergy across those three businesses you would expect it's the life cycle of missile defense if you will. And so, we're excited about that. But I also will say this synergy with AS to receive that sustainment business which has largely worked on either existing or soon to be fielded AS systems allows us to complete that lifecycle within the AS business looking at sustained systems and what's required to modernize them. So, we think this is beneficial to both segments in terms of the movements that we've made.
Ken Crews: And then related to that, the Rocket Motors has been a big issue kind of industry wide. Clearly, you have your own capability there. How do you see the Rocket Motor portion of that business both in terms of if there's any bottleneck or any constraints for what you're trying to do, but also externally the ability to grow sales there.
Kathy Warden: So, our Solid Rocket Motor business sitting inside of Defense Systems is mostly focused on tactical weapons and we have been growing that capacity and continue to execute funding to add to the capacity in the late '26 timeframe. We believe that the demand will be there to consume all of that capacity and probably continue to require more over time, but we are taking this in incremental steps to make sure that we don't get out ahead of capacity. And it's a whole variety of systems that we're supporting. It's often talked about as driven by stockpile replenishment of weapons that are being expended in regional conflicts, but it's also supporting new weapons that will be fielded to go into production in the later part of this decade. And so, that business is very diverse in terms of its pipeline and channels to market.
Douglas Harned: Very good. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Seth Seifman with J.P. Morgan. You may proceed.
Seth Seifman: Thanks very much and good morning.
Kathy Warden: Good morning.
Seth Seifman: Good morning. Kathy, in this administration and also some of the folks around it have been pretty vocal about looking to, I'm sure you've gotten questions over the years about defense startups and commercial technology. It seems like there is an effort in this administration to kind of accelerate both tapping into commercial technology and tapping into the capital that's in the commercial world. I guess, how does that make you think about anything related to the portfolio and what should be in it, what shouldn't be in it, where the focus should be Northrop's own capital deployment, any of those kind of big picture issues?
Kathy Warden: Yes. Look, first of all, we embrace new entrants into the space. We often and in this case are teaming with companies that bring new ideas or new technology. It does not cause me to question our strategy on technology differentiation, but it certainly does sharpen our focus on where we should invest relative to the competitive landscape. And as I think about how this might evolve over time, the defense landscape is continuing to grow both domestically and internationally. We are advancing into new technology areas and I think there's room for all of us to work together to provide the U.S. and our allies what they need.
Seth Seifman: Great, great. Thanks. And then, just as a follow-up, you talked about international growing faster this year and given the mix with space, that makes a lot of sense. When we look out further, I guess international had been running about $5 billion of sales. When you think longer term, is there either a dollar number or a percentage that you think about like later on in the decade?
Kathy Warden: Yes. Well, this year we're expecting growth to accelerate as I said and we expect double-digit growth this year. And we see a path for that continuing for multiple years. Based on the backlog we've built, I noted that we had a 1.4x book-to-bill in international in 2024 and we have a strong pipeline emerging across a wide variety of products, IBCS, E-2D, Triton, just to name a few. And so, as those mature in the pipeline, turn into awards and backlog, we could see the path to continue to grow international above U.S. sales growth rates.
Seth Seifman: Excellent. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Akers with Wells Fargo. You may proceed.
Matt Akers: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for the question.
Kathy Warden: Good morning.
Matt Akers: I wanted to ask about Sentinel and just if you heard anything new around the program review there. And as you think of kind of the long-term outlook, is there you said there's risk to the downside if that program sort of gets shifted out? Or is there risk to the upside if it sort of doesn't? Or do you think it's sort of well-calibrated?
Kathy Warden: Well, let me directly answer your question first and then I'll provide a little more context. We think that it's well calibrated in the outlook that we have provided. You'll recall last year we made some adjustments in both awards and booking rates that indicated our best estimate of the profile of how that program will be executed even through the restructure and that indeed is still what we believe today. We are working with the government on the restructure, but in the meantime we are performing and meeting important milestones on the EMD contract. The government has said that they project the restructure to take 18 to 24 months. So, we are still very much in that window. And we are -- even though they have paused work on some small infrastructure efforts in the command and launch segment that is reflected in what we have shared with you. We currently expect our 2025 Sentinel revenue to be in the mid-single digit percentage of total revenue, as I said, and continuing to grow from '24 into 2025.
Matt Akers: Yes, okay, thanks. And then, I guess the free cash flow outlook on slide 11 to that if I look at the years, I mean '25, much bigger step up than '26, '27. I know the pension starts to be kind of less of a tailwind after this year. But, just curious if there are any other kind of moving pieces that kind of the growth slows down after '25.
Ken Crews: Yes. So, what you're seeing in 2025 is a few things. It's the continuing management and robust management of our balance sheet and the working capital, as well as the profitable growth of the business and converting those margins to cash quickly. To your point, we also see tailwinds near term from CAS, but also our more normalized level of investments and capital expenditures. And then, when you move past 2025 into '26 and beyond, we have -- it's really driven by the overall growth of the business and continuing to manage our working capital, which I consider best in class. We're in the low single digits when you think about adjusted working capital as a percentage of sales. And so, it's really making sure that we continue to stay diligent managing the balance sheet. And then, as we grow the business, converting those margins to cash quickly, which is what more normalizes with the overall growth rate of the business.
Matt Akers: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Gavin Parsons with UBS. You may proceed.
Gavin Parsons: Hey, thanks. Good morning.
Kathy Warden: Good morning.
Ken Crews: Good morning.
Gavin Parsons: Aeronautics margin pressure, not too much year over year in 2025, given the B-21 ramp, I mean is there any change in the dilution consideration there? Or is that just kind of being offset by better performance in the core aeronautics segment?
Ken Crews: So, you've highlighted in 2024, extremely proud of the team and what they've been able to accomplish, even as B-21 has continued to ramp, driving efficiencies and implementing performance improvement initiatives across the portfolio. And we've been able to maintain earlier in the core -- early first three quarters, double digit returns with quarter four, slightly diluted just based on timings of mix. As we look to 2025, you hit it as we're continuing to expand on B-21, but the team has opportunities, given those efficiencies, to continue to drive performance improvements and allow us to maintain that mid to high 9% level of returns.
Gavin Parsons: Okay, great. How big is the microelectronics business?
Kathy Warden: The microelectronics center is a business that feeds the rest of the portfolio, as I discussed. So, it contains our foundries and our work in developing ships. But, we actually sell most of that embedded in systems in other parts of our company or sell them directly to external entities. So, the vast majority shows up in revenue in our segments. And it's largely our space business and our mission systems business, where that revenue resides. It's a significant portion of both of those businesses that have value creation starting in the microelectronics center.
Gavin Parsons: Helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Peter Arment with Baird. You may proceed.
Peter Arment: Yes, thanks. Good morning, Kathy and Ken.
Ken Crews: Good morning.
Peter Arment: Hey, Kathy. Northrop won a really nice contract in December, $3.5 billion for, I think, the fall-on for the E-6 Mercury program. Can you talk a little bit about that win? I know there also was some headlines around protests. Can you confirm whether that did get protested or not? And just how do we think about the contribution of revenues going forward? Thanks.
Kathy Warden: Yes. We call it the TACOMO program. But it's the C-130J, and it will provide nuclear command and control for the U.S. Department of Defense. It is contracted through the Navy. It was a $3.5 billion award. We have passed the protest period. And we are looking forward -- we have started. And we are looking forward to delivering that capability. It basically has three major components to it. In the EMD phase of the contract, we have three systems that we will develop and build as the demonstrator units. Then, we'll have three additional on option for test units. And then, LRIP option award of six production aircraft. So, that's what is in the scope of the effort. We expect about $350 million in revenue this first year and then growing from there.
Peter Arment: I appreciate that. Just as a follow-up, there's been a lot of discussions and back and forth of whether NGAD and CCA and how that's going to be reshaped. How is Norfolk thinking about the opportunity for either net NGAD or CCA?
Kathy Warden: Well, we're certainly watching that space. And as we have described before, we believe we are well positioned to offer sixth generation aircraft based on our successful B-21 performance and experience to date. We are not laying any of that into our forecast at this moment, given the uncertainty of timing, particularly the Air Force program. We're not a prime, but we are a contributor to the program through mission systems. For the Navy program, we are looking to see how that program advances through the year and would be excited to be selected if indeed that were to happen.
Peter Arment: I appreciate it. Thanks, Kathy.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Ciarmoli with Truist Securities. You may proceed.
Michael Ciarmoli: Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Kathy, can we just go back to international? You talked about the opportunities there and talked about the growth, how that will trend through the remainder of the decade. We obviously have the broad majority of NATO countries reinvesting in their own defense industrial bases. Is there a scenario where they start to procure more domestically, maybe for newer programs? And I mean, are you thinking about your international growth coming from existing legacy programs? Or is there more room for partnering as the NATO countries dial up their spending?
Kathy Warden: Right now, we believe that there is still a strong demand for U.S. products by the NATO countries, particularly to be able to field capability quickly, while the defense industrial base in Europe is reconstituting some of their capabilities. And so, we are looking at our pipeline, mostly inclusive of U.S. programs of record, where there is an application for those systems with NATO countries. I described earlier IBCS, E2, and Triton, all of which fall in that category, where they are now mature option programs and our NATO allies can receive them fairly quickly and get the benefit of those capabilities.
Michael Ciarmoli: Got it, got it, that's helpful. And then, just on, you mentioned the new industry entrance. What about, how are you viewing DOGE? And I know it's evolving seemingly on a regular basis here and there's a lot of different tweets, but even if we think about contracting changes, moving away from cost plus, are you seeing that risk or opportunities there?
Kathy Warden: Net-net, I see more opportunity working with DOGE. I believe we all see that there is room for cost efficiency in the way that we work together between industry and government. And so, we've embraced the opportunity to share some of our observations and ideas and are starting to do that.
Michael Ciarmoli: Great, thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Richard Safran with Seaport Research Partners. You may proceed.
Richard Safran: Kathy, Ken, Todd, good morning. So, I'd like to ask you to expand a little bit more about your talk about bookings. You mentioned some of this in international. More generally, could you discuss the 2025 major opportunities that you're looking at that we should be watching? And more importantly, more specifically, your expectations for full-year bookings, if you think book-to-bill is going to remain above 1X, despite a growing top line. I mean, you did report some pretty strong book-to-bill numbers.
Ken Crews: Yes, so for the second part of the question first, when we think about 2025 book-to-bill, we see it more around the one, one time sales, particularly in fact, of the strong history of bookings and some of those being multiyear. And so, we'll work against that backlog, but we'll also build it back up and be roughly around one time sales. When we think about growth opportunities and award opportunities moving forward, we have opportunities, particularly in space around restricted activities. We have it on the strategic comm side. We have continued growth as we and awards relative to B-21 as we think about advance procurements and continuing production activities. And then, on Mission Systems, it's a whole host of awards across ground-based sensors and airborne-based sensors, when you think about airborne radars, EW systems, as well as communication systems. And then, DS is, we just recently received IBCS. We see IBCS continuing to grow in 2025, as well as numerous awards, particularly around weapons systems and ammunition. When we look at that, we're building the backlog. It continues to build. We've seen about 15% growth year-over-year on the weapons system side. And so, those awards continue to roll in as well.
Richard Safran: Okay. Let's leave it at that. Thank you very much.
Kathy Warden: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Gursky with Citi. You may proceed.
Jason Gursky: Hey, good morning, everybody. Kathy, you spent quite a bit of time up front talking about the strategy of the company. I was wondering if you could just maybe comment on your top two or three priorities for the year and how you see yourself spending your time in prioritizing the implementation of that strategy and what you're going to be really focused on this year.
Kathy Warden: Thanks, Jason. My priority is very much aligned with what I outlined. I believe the administration's priorities are the first, equipping our military to be the best fighting force in the world means advancing technologies and our strategy to provide technology differentiation, not just for the benefit of our shareholders in our company being able to grow, but for our customers to be able to fulfill their mission is our top priority. We also are very focused on efficiency within the company, much like the administration is, and we see this as an opportunity to work together and get more efficient step function improvements in how we are able to execute work so that we can deliver for the warfighter in a more cost-effective and timely way. And then, of course, within the company, deploying our resources to the areas that make the most impact, both for our shareholders and our customers, and we've been very focused on doing that and making smart strategic choices for capital deployment. So, those are the three areas that I'm focused on and will continue to be.
Jason Gursky: Right, okay. That's great. And then, just following up maybe on Seth's question about the ecosystem, and I think you gave some comments on your perspective on the evolving ecosystem. I'm just kind of curious, though, what you're hearing from the customer, and what you're seeing them say and do as it relates to maybe enabling some of these VC-backed defensive bringing new technologies? Are we likely to see maybe, I don't want to say a lowering of standards, but maybe going back to lowest cost, technically acceptable kinds of constructs? And what are you seeing them say and do as it relates to trying to enable some of these companies?
Kathy Warden: I still very much see a broad set of acquisition strategies being utilized across the Department of Defense that are matching what the government needs. Sometimes that is very capable systems that are developmental and innovative by nature. In other cases, it relies on technology that is lower cost, more commoditized. And that has been, and I believe will continue to be the case. And the department is implementing strategies that allow them to embrace both, as they should. But the reality is, we cannot equip the best fighting force in the world with technology that isn't leading the way, rather than leveraging what is commercially available.
Jason Gursky: Okay. Great, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. You may proceed.
Robert Stallard: Thanks so much. Good morning.
Kathy Warden: Good morning.
Ken Crews: Good morning.
Robert Stallard: Kathy, just to start off, on capital deployment, with a perhaps more relaxed regulatory environment moving forward, does that open the aperture for you with regards potentially to do more acquisitions?
Kathy Warden: Oh, I think it's a little early to say what the regulatory environment will look like, particularly in the area of national security. Certainly, there have been concerns voiced about over consolidation. We have new entrants coming into the space and so market is opening up some, but I think that, that still will be a consideration as much for the Department of Defense as for the Department of Justice. But with that said, we have been able to manage our portfolio well over these last several years. The acquisition of Orbital APK, of course, was a terrific add to the company. We've done some recent divestitures and we'll continue to be active in portfolio management in any regulatory environment where we see opportunity to create value for shareholders.
Robert Stallard: Okay. And then, just a quick follow-up for Ken, on the lot 2 LRIP of B-21, were there any accounting or cash flow impacts from that milestone?
Ken Crews: No, we were awarded B-21 in Q4 and as we go through our normal detailed program reviews and EAC reviews, no changes there. And in terms of cash flow, again, we took the charge in 2023. Those cash flows and the associated impacts occur over a long duration when you think about the LRIP lots. And all of that's accounted for in the guidance that we provide.
Robert Stallard: Okay. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Gautam Khanna with TD Cowen. You may proceed.
Gautam Khanna: Yes, good morning. I wanted to follow up on the Mission Systems margin expansion in 2025. I'm curious how much mix is a driver of it, mix of cost plus moving to fixed price. Does that percentage change materially in 2025 versus 2024?
Ken Crews: So, when we think about Mission Systems 2024 to 2025, not a significant portion of it is driven by mix. It's really driven by the performance and the implementation of the efficiencies. And then, as we've scaled the business, and as I talked about earlier, the learning and the development that has occurred, that is the driver. We do see mission systems in terms of mix shifting more towards FFP over the planning period, talk about the next five years, but gradual shift in the interim.
Gautam Khanna: Got you. And then, just a quick follow-up, if in fact there is kind of an end to the Ukraine-Russia hostilities, what impact, if any, would be felt at Northrop and over what time frame? I assume at defense systems, but just what do you think of that?
Kathy Warden: Yes. So, our revenue from tactical weapons and the kinds of systems that we would see being directly expended in Ukraine is less than 1% of revenue, just to give you a broad-based context. And we do believe that there will be a multi-year replenishing of stockpiles associated with those that have been depleted, so we don't see an immediate ramification.
Gautam Khanna: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Myles Walton with Wolfe Research. You may proceed.
Myles Walton: Thanks. Good morning. Ken, I think when you listed the opportunity set for '25, I don't think I heard F/A-XX. I'm just curious, Kathy or Ken, how are you feeling about the timing and potential for Northrop to be a participant?
Kathy Warden: Yes, Myles. So, when I mentioned the Navy's next generation fighter, we do believe that the Navy is progressing through source selection as they had indicated, and they have also shared that we are one of the companies in that source selection. So, we will continue to watch how that unfolds over the course of this year and keep you updated. There's not much more I can say about it given the restricted nature of the procurement.
Myles Walton: Got it. Okay. And then, maybe, Ken, on the free cash flow side. Thanks for updating for 2027. There have -- there has been a $4 billion target for 2028. Does the trajectory still align with that $4 billion 2028 target in the future?
Ken Crews: Yes, when we look out in the future and projected cash flows, we are on track to achieving the $4 billion in 2028, so no change there.
Myles Walton: Okay, great. Thanks so much.
Kathy Warden: Thank you.
Todd Ernst: Hey, Josh. We're going to leave it there. I'll turn it over to Kathy for closing remarks.
Kathy Warden: Great. Thanks, Todd. So, I want to close by acknowledging the -- just extraordinary accomplishments of our team in 2024. And I'm particularly grateful for the commitment of our team members in the LA area. I think many of you know, we have over 13,000 employees in that area who are dealing with a wildfire devastation in their local community. And we are so appreciative that they continue to come to work every day and support our mission. Our company's innovation, people, investments, and commitment, they sit at the core of this nation's ability to maintain peace through strength. And so, we remain focused on helping our customers succeed in their most challenging missions and we're really excited about the year ahead. So, thank you for joining today's call. We look forward to talking with you again soon.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-10-24 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's Third Quarter 2024 Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. My name is Josh, and I will be your operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Todd Ernst, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Ernst, please proceed.
Todd Ernst: Thanks, Josh, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's third quarter 2024 conference call. Before we start, matters discussed on today's call, including guidance and outlooks for 2024 and beyond, reflect the company's judgment based on information available at the time of this call. They constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, including those noted in today's press release and our SEC filing. These risks and uncertainties may cause actual company results to differ materially. Today's call will include non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to our GAAP results in our earnings release. Third quarter results reflect the realignment of the SDS division from space systems to defense systems. In addition, we will refer to a presentation that is posted on our Investor Relations website. On the call today are Kathy Warden, our Chair, CEO, and President, Dave Keffer, our CFO through September 30th, and Ken Crews, our CFO, as of the first of this month. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kathy. Kathy?
Kathy Warden: Thanks, Todd. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We delivered strong operating performance again in the third quarter, building on the momentum we achieved through the first half of the year. Global events continue to highlight the need for advanced capabilities to defend and deter against increasingly complex threats. This is driving the demand for our differentiated portfolio and is evident in our results. In the third quarter, our book-to-bill was once again very strong, which drove backlog to a new record level. Our backlog is now $85 billion, which is more than two times our annual revenue, supporting our confidence in the future growth of this business. Revenue has increased 6% year-to-date, and we are on track to achieve our full-year guidance of 5% growth. The Northrop Grumman team continues to deliver critical capabilities for our customers, remain disciplined in new business pursuits, and drive cost efficiencies in our operations resulting in this strong performance. Segment operating margins significantly increased, both sequentially and year-over-year, to 11.5% this quarter, our highest margin rate in over two years. Solid sales volume and strong operating performance drove earnings per share of $7 in the quarter, an increase of 13% from last year's Q3 results. Free cash flow of $730 million was in line with our expectations and continues to provide us the considerable flexibility to deploy capital in support of both growing our business and our shareholder return strategy. Based on our solid year-to-date results and full-year outlook, we are increasing our EPS guidance range by $0.75. We are pleased with this performance because it's a direct result of the intentional steps we've been taking to realize continued growth and enhanced profitability. We continue to implement productivity and efficiency initiatives, including advanced production capabilities, digital engineering tools, and increased automation. We are streamlining processes, reducing rework, and improving our learning curves as we add up scale, resulting in improved program and operating performance. The impact of these initiatives was, again, evident this quarter at AS, where execution was outstanding. The mature production portion of AS' portfolio comprises more than half of its overall revenue, and it continues to perform very well. The B21 program has also made solid progress in achieving ground and flight testing milestones on the development contract and is continuing to execute the aircraft production contract in line with our estimates. This is our third quarter in a row of 10% or better margins at AS, due largely to our focus on total cost management and productivity. Space’s performance was also excellent in the quarter. As we expected, revenue was down modestly year-over-year based on the wind down of NGI and a restricted program, but earnings were up substantially. Strong program performance was the key driver as the team executed well, mitigating risks and realizing opportunities, leading to improved EAC trends in recent quarters. Our defense systems business continues to see broad-based demand, with a book-to-bill of 1.6 times in the quarter, building the foundation for future growth. Margin performance year-to-date is solid and consistent with our full-year outlook. While the timing of some of our shorter cycle programs affected sales this quarter, looking forward, DS is expected to be one of our fastest growing segments, with margin expansion opportunities as we realize increased international sales. Like at DS, we also see continued strong demand at mission systems. This segment also had a book-to-bill of 1.6 times in the quarter and robust 7% revenue growth. Mission systems is a leader in technology that's in high demand from our customers as reflected in their top-line results. And as we've seen this business grow, we've seen mix in productivity pressures, including in supply chain deliveries. The team is making good progress with the deliberate actions they've been taking to improve program performance and drive cost efficiencies. And I have confidence that we are on track to achieve higher MS margins in 2025. As we look forward, we see multiple trends across our portfolio that are supportive of continued margin expansion, including improving macroeconomic conditions, stabilizing supply chains, enhanced workforce productivity, and gradual shifts in our contract mix as a number of our largest programs transition to production, and we build our international portfolio. We also expect to see continued strong demand for the platform, sensors, and systems we provide that allow our customers to deter adversaries and operate in the most demanding threat environment. This demand is reflected in U.S. budgets, where there's strong bipartisan support for national security priorities. And as a result, we are seeing upward pressure on defense budgets. Over the past several months, the Senate Defense Authorization and Appropriations legislation proposed additional funding above the administration's fiscal year 2025 defense budget request. And while the legislative process is still playing out, it is encouraging to see strong support for both the budget and our program. As we look at markets outside the U.S., we continue to expect our international sales to grow faster than the rest of our business over the next several years. There is robust international demand for defense capabilities, particularly in Europe, where most NATO members are increasing defense spending from 2022 levels. This demand is reflected in our international book to bill, which was almost two times in the third quarter. While executing on our current programs is an important driver of our profitable growth outlook, we also remain focused on winning new development programs. Our strategy is based on continuing to deliver technical innovations to create competitive advantage for our customers. A great example of this is our selection by the Missile Defense Agency to develop the Glide Phase Interceptor, or GPI. This technology will address increasingly sophisticated hypersonic missile threats. In addition, this program is a collaboration between the U.S. and Japan, and will further strengthen the alliance with Japan and further ING's partnership with Japanese industry. Putting all of this together, as we look forward to 2025, we expect solid growth and strong performance to continue based on our record backlog and continued focus on program execution. At a company level, we project sales growth between 3% and 4%. This includes strong growth in three of our four segments. For space, we expect a mid single-digit decline due to the wind down on programs I referred to earlier. We continue to expect the company's segment operating margin to improve in 2025, driven by favorable macro trends, program performance, and cost discipline. Our free cash flow outlook is consistent with our prior long-term forecast, with 2025 increasing greater than 20% year-over-year. Investing in our growing business remains a priority. We are coming through a period of peak CapEx, and anticipate a reduced spending level in 2025, but still at a level above historical norms. And given our company's strong free cash flow outlook, we plan to continue our shareholder-friendly capital deployment strategy, returning approximately 100% of free cash flow to shareholders next year. The dynamic global environment calls for our industry to offer our customers the technology innovations they need to compete. Northrop Grumman continues to invest in the capabilities and capacity needed to deliver that competitive edge for them. We are also intensely focused on the talent in digital infrastructure that enables our performance and competitive differentiation. Our team is delivering today while also building for our future. Financially, this is translating into solid results now, a plan to rapidly expand cash flows over the next several years and a business that is well positioned for profitable growth for the foreseeable future. Before turning things over, I'd like to welcome Ken Crews, who became our CFO on October 1. Ken will talk through our forward outlook in just a moment. But first, I'll turn the call over to Dave for a discussion of our Q3 results. And as I do so, recognizing this will be his last call, I'd like to thank Dave for his leadership and outstanding service to our company. Dave, over to you.
Dave Keffer : Thanks, Kathy. It's been an incredibly rewarding five years in this role, and I've enjoyed the opportunity to work with you, Ken, and the whole Northrop Grumman team. I'm confident you'll continue to do great things going forward. Now looking at the Q3 results, we continue to experience enduring demand for our capabilities in support of our U.S. and international customers. As Kathy mentioned, backlog hit a new record of $85 billion, driven by another quarter of strong bookings. Our international awards were particularly strong in Q3 at $2.7 billion, increasing our international backlog to almost $8 billion, the highest level in several years. Key awards included additional E2D aircraft for Japan, ammunition and urgent need capabilities at DS, and radar programs at MS. We continue to have a wide range of opportunities in our global pipeline that we're optimistic we can convert into bookings and revenue over the coming years. Turning to sales on Slide 4 in our earnings deck, strong momentum from the first half of the year continued in Q3 throughout most of our portfolio. Sales increased by 2% in the quarter and are up 6% year-to-date. Q3 sales were slightly below our expectation due to a few delivery timing shifts to Q4, primarily in DS, but those do not impact the full year outlook. Starting with aeronautics, Q3 sales were $2.9 billion, up by 4% compared to the prior year. The increase was driven by higher volume on F-35, E2, and Triton, partially offset by slightly lower sales on restricted programs. At defense systems, third quarter sales increased by 2%. Higher sales on Sentinel and from our weapons portfolio drove the increase. As I noted, sales would have been even stronger if not for a shift into Q4 of roughly $150 million of international ammunition sales that are in our backlog. And on Sentinel, we continue to partner with the Air Force on the restructure of the program, which resulted in adjustments to the timing of certain activities as we refine the latest program schedule. Mission system sales were particularly strong in Q3, up 7% compared to the prior year. MS saw an increase in sales throughout much of its portfolio, led by higher volume on microelectronics and advanced technology programs. And space sales were lower by 3%, consistent with our expectations, due to a headwind of $224 million in the period from the wind down of our work on the restricted space and NGI programs. The remaining space portfolio grew at mid-single digits, driven by higher sales on SDA satellite programs and other restricted work. Moving to the bottom line, Q3 segment operating income expanded to 11.5%. This performance was enabled by our continued focus on cost efficiencies, risk retirements, and outstanding program performance. AS operating income grew by 5%, generating an excellent operating margin rate of 10.4% in Q3. DS generated solid performance in the period, with operating income modestly lower than the prior period. Its Q3 operating margin rate included fewer net EAC adjustments and a change in contract mix. Mission systems operating income increased 1%, and its margin rate improved from the first half of the year to 13.8%. And space delivered a great quarter, with operating income up 14% and an OM rate of 12%. We continue to see improvements in space's program performance based on deliberate actions we've taken, and this was reflected in the level of net favorable earnings adjustments in the period. Turning to Slide 6. Earnings per share in Q3 increased by 13%, driven by the solid segment performance I described as well as from higher net pension income. A lower federal tax rate and strong performance in our marketable securities portfolio also provided an uplift. Our Q3 tax rate benefited from a net reduction in certain reserves in the period. Keep in mind, for EPS comparison purposes than in the third quarter of last year, we recognized a gain of $0.44 per share associated with the sale of a minority investment. Lastly, I'll take a moment to discuss our cash performance. Third quarter free cash flow was $730 million, in line with our expectations. Year-to-date, we remain ahead of our free cash flow position compared to this time last year. And we expect a strong quarter of cash generation in Q4, consistent with our historical pattern. And with that, I'll hand it off to you, Ken.
Ken Crews: Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. I'll spend a few moments on the forward outlook, beginning with our latest segment guidance on Slide 7 in our earnings deck. Aeronautics continues to perform at a high level. And as a result, we are increasing both its margin and sales rate guidance. We now expect sales of roughly $12 billion, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 11%. With another quarter of strong operating performance, we are increasing its operating margin rate guidance to approximately 10%. This increase reflects our confidence in this business to generate healthy margins even as B-21 scales. At DS, we are modestly lowering our sales guidance to the high $8 billion range, reflecting a mid-single-digit year-over-year growth rate. This update reflects our latest expectations for lower Sentinel volume this year, driven by timing connected with the program's restructure. And we are increasing our margin rate guidance at Space to the mid- to high 10% range, while updating our expectations for margin rate at MS to high 13%. Moving to company level guidance. We are reaffirming our full year sales guidance. At the midpoint of the range, this represents a sequential increase in sales to roughly $10.9 billion in quarter four, similar to the ramp we experienced during the fourth quarter of 2023. Fourth quarter sales will be driven by higher volume on the LRIP phase of B-21 international ammo deliveries at DS and multiple production programs at MS. Based on our successful execution of cost savings initiatives and our strong program performance, we are increasing the lower end of our segment operating income range. Q4 margins at MS and DS are expected to improve sequentially due to production mix and deliveries, while AS and Space margins are expected to be lower sequentially due to mix and lower expected net earnings adjustments. Altogether, our latest guidance continues to reflect a full year segment OM rate of 11% at the midpoint. We are reaffirming our guidance range for free cash flow that projects greater than 15% growth at the midpoint. We remain confident in our ability to generate strong and predictable cash flows. Year-to-date, we've returned $3 billion of cash to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases, and we continue to expect $2.5 billion in repurchases for the full year. Lastly, we are again increasing our earnings per share expectations, now to a range of $25.65 to $26.05, up by $0.75. This updated range reflects our confidence in continued strong segment performance, lower corporate unallocated costs, lower interest expense and a more favorable tax rate. Next, I wanted to take a moment to talk about pension income. Our pension plans remain in great shape with a funded status over 100% and minimal cash contributions projected over the next several years. Our funded status drives affordability for our customers and help support strong capital returns to our shareholders. As we've done the last few years, we provided a net pension income sensitivity table for the upcoming year in our earnings deck. Through September 30, asset returns have been in the low 7% range and discount rates were down modestly. So as we sit here today, there is no change to our 2025 net pension income expectations that we shared in January. As we look forward to 2025, we remain confident in our business strategy. As Kathy outlined, and as shown on Slide 10, we expect another year of solid growth, continued margin expansion and a lower level of capital expenditures. This combination, along with lower R&D cash taxes and higher CAS recoveries, produces a recipe to rapidly grow our cash flows. At the midpoint, we expect free cash flow growth of over 20% next year. And with our capital deployment strategy of investing in our business for profitable growth and returning cash to shareholders, free cash flow per share is growing even faster. Also, our 2025 outlook assumes that macro conditions will remain stable and the continuing resolution will have a similar duration to those of recent years. In closing, I believe our strategy will continue to create value for our customers and shareholders, and I'm confident about the opportunities we have ahead. I look forward to engaging further with the investment community over the coming quarters. I also wanted to take a moment to thank Dave for his leadership and contributions to our company and for support during this transition. With that, let's open the call for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. You may proceed.
Robert Stallard : Hi, thanks so much. Good morning.
Kathy Warden: Good morning.
Robert Stallard : And best of luck, Dave, with your next ventures. A couple of contract or program questions for you, Kathy. First of all, on Sentinel, it looks like the timetable here is moving around a bit. But I was wondering if there was any financial or practical implications as a result of this schedule change? And then secondly, on the program we won in the quarter, GPI, I was wondering -- I mean, it might be classified, I was wondering if you could give us a bit more detail of the contract structure for this program and how the revenues are likely to progress from here? Thank you.
Kathy Warden: Great. Thanks, Rob. Let me start with Sentinel. As we noted in the call, both this quarter and last, we had incorporated into our outlook for the program the changes that will result from the Nunn-McCurdy review and the restructure process that the Air Force is going through. That restructure process has started. It has not concluded. We expect it to continue well into next year. And yet we have looked at what we believe is most likely to happen as we do on any of our programs and incorporated that into our estimates. And so that is the smoothing of sales that you heard us talk about in the resulted from our view of what the ramp will look like as we move into 2025. And we do still expect the program to grow year-over-year from '24 into '25, just as it did '24 over '23. So a similar profile just moved out a bit over a longer period of time. On GPI, there, we're very pleased to be supporting the missile defense agency in this area to build an interceptor that will defeat hypersonic missile threats. And you know this is a very important area for national security to be able to defend against these threats as they evolve. We are starting with a piece of work that will continue what we have been doing around risk reduction and design and move to a more mature design in this next phase, getting eventually to a preliminary design review. And then after that, we will move to the next phase of the program. So it is an incremental funding approach, but this down select was important because it signifies that missile defense agency, like their design, and wants to continue in the development process with us.
Robert Stallard : That’s great. Thank you, Kathy.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ronald Epstein with Bank of America. You may proceed.
Ronald Epstein : Yeah, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Kathy, broadly, given the demand you're seeing across the businesses and the growth that you're going to have, what are you seeing in the supply chain? Are there tight points right now? Are there places that you're worried about? Going to be heard broadly from companies across the sector that there are still large supply chain issues. How are you managing it? And what areas are you worried about and working on?
Kathy Warden: Yeah, Ron, we still see supply chain challenges mostly with capacity and productivity. And let me unpack that a bit. They aren't concentrated in any one area of the business. They're broad-based and they tend now to be more supplier dependent. And so we are working with individual suppliers to help them address their particular challenges. It stands from microelectronics to our solid rocket motor business supply chain as they try to ramp to the increased capacity that we are all asking of them. It includes even some of our Space and Aerostructure partners in space and AS, respectively. And so each of our teams across the segments have their top list of suppliers that they're working with. We do extensive monitoring of our supply chain so that we can hopefully see these issues coming. And then as soon as we do engage with the supplier to provide support, I don't expect that we will see all of these issues mitigated this year. It's improving and in many places, stabilizing, but we are carrying risk and certainly some plans into 2025 to continue to monitor and work with our suppliers.
Ronald Epstein : Does it make sense to vertically integrate anywhere just in the supply chain so you can control some of it?
Kathy Warden: We have not generally taken a strategy of vertically integrating unless we feel that there is no path forward to support the supplier in remaining viable. We obviously, from time to time, move away from a supplier that is not performing to another supplier that we first try to remediate and where we have, very few, or even some places sole source suppliers our first instinct is not to enforce that. It is to support them. But there are times when ultimately, we do find ourselves needing to bring capability in-house to ensure we perform on behalf of our customer commitment.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. You may proceed.
Sheila Kahyaoglu : Good morning, Kathy and everyone. Thank you so much. Maybe if we could talk about the multiyear growth cadence, just looking at the backlog pretty solid and a competitor talked about supply chain and potentially being able to execute to close the gaps. Assuming the headwinds in Space go away and just thinking about flagship programs, what type of growth should we be thinking about and targeting for Northrop over the multiyear time horizon?
Kathy Warden: Well, we've been growing at 5% compound annual growth since 2019. And each year, we come into the year with opportunities and risks that we work to mitigate, and I'm very proud of the team for having been able to keep and maintain that very solid growth rate for the last five years. As we look forward, we've guided at 3% to 4%, as you know, and that too has both risks and opportunities. We think it's a very balanced approach. If we were to see some of these supply chain challenges ease, we could see upward pressure on that growth rate if we are competitively successful on opportunities in our pipeline, we could see upward pressure on that growth rate. And if we are able to continue to capture international business at the rate we did in the second -- in the third quarter at 2 times our sales that certainly will provide some upward pressure on that growth rate. So we are working hard to materialize those opportunities. There are clearly risks as well. Really, the downside is the flip side of each of those things that I just outlined. But we believe that 3% to 4% next year is a realistic starting point as we enter the year with what we know today. We don't guide beyond that, as you know. But I have said that I believe this business can continue to grow in that mid-single-digit range. And so that is the plan that we've laid out for ourselves. And based on what we see today, we think that's achievable.
Sheila Kahyaoglu : Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Strauss with Barclays. You may proceed.
David Strauss : Good morning, and welcome Ken.
Ken Crews: Thank you. Good morning.
David Strauss : Kathy, I wanted to see if you could just broadly touch on B-21 and the progress there relative to the charge that you've taken, kind of where you are in sign up additional LRIP lots, pricing on those, where you are with kind of locking in your suppliers. Yeah, just kind of wherever you want to take it in terms of an update on B-21 and then margin progression at AS. Thanks.
Kathy Warden: So let me start with B-21 and then I will tie it to the broader AS margin picture because that's important in that. While B-21 is a key program in our company, it is not the majority of AS sales and so the rest of the picture is important in drawing out the view on margin performance for the business, which, as I said, was just outstanding again this quarter. With B-21, we are on track for meeting the milestones associated with an award of LRIP 2. And so we are expecting that to happen in the fourth quarter. We have talked to you about being awarded approximately annually. And so this is the time of year where happens, and we expect to get that on contract. We have no change to pricing. As you know, those were priced. And we have no change to our estimate complete based on our third quarter review. So we are continuing to perform, as I said a few moments ago in alignment with the plan that we have laid out for the B-21. I'm very proud of that team. It's quite a remarkable accomplishment to what they are doing, both on development and production. As we look at the broader AS through activities they've taken to manage costs and drive productivity, some really innovative work they're doing in workforce training to get new employees onto the factory floor, more productive on day one and down the learning curve quicker. We have been able to really improve our performance on the more mature production programs as well, which has provided even further lift to AS and contributed to the very strong margin rates that we are seeing on that mature production portfolio. We had talked a year ago about that being the vision, and I'm pleased to say that the team has executed it very well.
David Strauss : Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Gursky with Citi. You may proceed.
Jason Gursky : Hey, good morning everyone. Thanks for taking the call. Question, Kathy, just a quick one for you on the trends going on there in Europe and the pipeline and the bookings that you've been seeing there given the demand. I'm just curious the contract types that you'll be operating with there, generally speaking, FMS versus direct commercial? And kind of what does that portend for margins across the business is going forward as that mix shifts maybe a little bit more to some international work?
Kathy Warden: It's a combination of contract types that we see across our international sales portfolio for our ammunition and weapons products. We typically see those as direct commercial sales. And for our more complex weapon systems, anything that would entail integration, for instance, [indiscernible] Triton, we would see those as FMS sales. In both cases, we tend to see those as accretive to overall both segment and company margin rate. As a result of us being further down the learning curve when we price those because we're building off of mature product lines. And so we expect that trend to continue as we look at the pipeline into next year because some of the weapon system sales are larger. We do see that as a bigger contributor to the growth. But DCS is also an important part of the international pipeline, and we see both growing into next year.
Jason Gursky : Okay. Great. And then just a quick follow-up, just sticking with contract types domestically, are you seeing interesting comments or observations that you can make about the current contracting environment in the -- any shifts in DoD strategy on how they're going to ask you all to get yourselves on contract going forward?
Kathy Warden: I haven't seen any significant shift but more dialogue for sure, in terms of what contract type is appropriate for the work that is being conducted. And as a result, we have seen on particular opportunities, a shift from one type to another based on industry engagement. So I think that's healthy. It's helping the government to really understand what motivates industry and what's necessary in terms of the business conditions for us to be able to invest in the way that supports the government ability to get products in a timely fashion. Because at the end of the day, cost is one element, but schedule is another, and we want to make sure that we can deliver not only what, but when and at the price that is agreed to. So getting the contract type right is an important ingredient to make that all work.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Deuschle with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.
Scott Deuschle : Hey, good morning.
Kathy Warden: Good morning.
Scott Deuschle : Ken, was the F-35 program a driver of positive EACs at Aeronautics again this quarter? And then would there be additional opportunity to expand margins on center fuselage over the coming years as you move to newer lots that have some better pricing on them?
Ken Crews : So we're -- thanks for the question, Scott. We're absolutely pleased with AS' performance in the quarter and what drove the overall positive in terms of net earnings adjustments. It really was a portfolio approach. And so it wasn't one program alone. It was mature production programs from across that portfolio. And we expect that to be the case, and it's really showing the benefits of the deliberate actions that we're taking to drive costs out of the business, to create efficiencies and it's paying off. As we look forward, our team is focused on leveraging the investments we made in our factories to drive efficiencies. And so I do anticipate opportunities across our mature production programs moving forward, leading to improved booking rates. However, knowing in 2025, we do have a mix shift, particularly related to the growth on the restricted programs, which will put pressure relative to the overall booking rates you saw in AS this year.
Scott Deuschle : Okay. And then, Ken, maybe just what segments do you view as having the greatest opportunity to expand margins next year? And then maybe you could walk through some of the drivers there that would underpin that?
Ken Crews : Sure. So when we think about next year is we see opportunities to expand margin across three of the four segments for my previous comments on AS. I would say, given the comments that Kathy made before, the mix of international, the focus on weapon systems, I believe DS has -- is one of the major drivers of that margin expansion. Also, too, is with MS, it's important to realize that MS creates an immense amount of value for our company and our shareholders. They're booking close to 14%. We've seen some headwinds that as we've communicated are temporal in nature. And so as we move forward, do expect MS to continue to see accretive margins. And then long term, as we shift back more towards FFP that margin expansion will continue to get back to the historical norms that we've seen. And then in space, I think this quarter is an absolute great reflection of space and the activities that they are taking to focus on performance, drive efficiencies into the business. And so we see opportunities there to expand margins as well. So it's going to be a portfolio approach across those three segments and DS should be the primary driver.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Gautam Khanna with TD Cowen. You may proceed.
Gautam Khanna : Yeah. Congrats, Dave and Ken. I'm curious on two things. One, just big picture, we got an election coming up. Do you see any dramatic differences between either candidate or administration on your programs and defense broadly? And then I have a follow-up.
Kathy Warden: Thanks, Gautam. And welcome. I do not see a significant difference. What we have seen over time is that the defense budget more reflects the threat environment than any particular administration change. And so we fully expect that again this time. The National Defense strategy has remained consistent over the past several years and the last couple of administrations. And we believe that's because it is responsive to the emerging threats around the globe and focused on both deterring and defending. And in that regard, it's well aligned to the program portfolio that Northrop Grumman has with a significant portion of our work supporting the U.S. in both builds and modernization of the nuclear triad, but also a portfolio that very much supports the U.S. and our allies in being able to defend in conflict when called upon. So we expect those to continue to be the driving features of a national defense strategy, and therefore, what the budgets will support and reflect.
Gautam Khanna : Thank you. And just a quick follow-up on space beyond 2025. I mean what do you think kind of the longer-term trajectory of that revenue will be?
Kathy Warden: What we've said about Space beyond 2025 is that we do expect it to return to growth. And we also have said that it's growing mid-single digits without the headwinds of the two programs that are winding down. So it gives you a good sense of what we think that run rate might look like coming out of 2025.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Harned with Bernstein. You may proceed.
Doug Harned : Hi, good morning. Thank you. Kathy, I wanted to follow up on the Space question because it's been complicated with the movement of Sentinel and NGI and the classified program. When you look forward from here, I guess, first of all, is it possible to compare apples-to-apples on what's changed in the space backlog over the past year, if we take out those other programs? And then can you highlight kind of what some of the more important programs -- or program areas will be in getting the growth rate you're talking about?
Kathy Warden: Sure. When you look at the move of the SDS portfolio from space to defense, it is largely the sentinel program. And so the backlog shifts that we made there gives you a sense of what that profile is Sentinel. And you also can take a look at what's remaining and see that there is a very healthy sized backlog to support the space business. And while it's made up of a number of programs, many of which are restricted, it is broad-based in its nature. It is supporting ground, satellite builds, it is supporting intelligence missions as well as the Department of Defense and a significant portion of it is NASA and related civilian missions. And so can say is the backlog is well diversified. It is large, and it is in many cases, early stage programs that still have a lot of runway in front of them in terms of either future awards or production volume associated with development program.
Doug Harned : And then just if I can, one follow-up on Defense Systems. Can you give a picture at all of what your expectation is for the percentage you'll get from international over the next couple of years since it is clearly expanding?
Kathy Warden: Doug, I'd prefer to wait until we guide in 2025 because it is rapidly expanding. And as you know, at this time of year, we're still in our process of laying out the details associated with our long-range plan. And I know you're not just asking for what does that look like in a flip-year flip in 2025. But what does that trajectory look like over time. And I'll be able to give some more color on that in the January call and we'd be happy to do so since it is an important part of our growth strategy, not just in Defense Systems, but we believe it's material to the company overall. In two other segments, both Aeronautics and Mission Systems have significant international growth opportunities as well.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Myles Walton with Wolf Research. You may proceed. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Ken Herbert with RBC Capital Markets.
Ken Herbert : Yeah, hi. Good morning. Kathy, I wanted to ask you a question about autonomy. You've got a number of legacy programs here as we go to AUSA and look across the industry funding for autonomy and related technologies just seems to be incredibly strong. How would you characterize your portfolio in autonomy today? Where are you investing? And maybe what do you see as a couple of the big opportunities for you over the next few years?
Kathy Warden: Yeah. We certainly have been a leader in autonomy and continue to be and across multiple domains and weapon system types. So when you think about our history, it's largely been associated with aircraft. And we clearly are a leader there in truly autonomous, not remotely piloted, but truly autonomous vehicles, having several in operations today and continue to invest in that area for the future of uncrewed aircraft. When you think about satellites, the command and control of a satellite, it is an ultimate autonomous vehicle. And more and more, the opportunity set in space is around maneuverability and command and control. So we're investing there. And then finally, when you think about weapon systems, they are less expensive, uncrewed vehicles in many cases, and that's not just in the weapon itself, but as we think about the role that they play in defense. So we are investing in autonomy company-wide and really drawing threads across those investments and not thinking so much about the platform that the technology self, which in this case, it's more in the software and integration. And one of the differentiation of our company is that we are not just hardware, we're software and integration, and we've demonstrated that through a number of leading-edge programs that allow us to get the benefit of both worlds coming together at scale and in operation.
Ken Herbert : That's helpful. And as the software continues to be a driver here, do you think there's risk that on the customer side, sort of adoption or risk appetite could potentially hold back some of the opportunities here? Or how do you think the customer is able to keep up with what you're able to do on the technology side?
Kathy Warden: I think there's an appetite for the capability that is strong, getting through a certification program, particularly when you think about airworthiness with an autonomous vehicle is not easy, and we've done it, not many companies have, and we have, but it is a rigorous process for good reasons. And it is one that should remain rigorous, and that's really where you need to be assured that your software is sufficiently protected and tested to be able to operate and under conditions where you may have denied communications and jamming and other impacts to what would be rudimentary ways of supporting autonomy or remote piloting. So I'm going into a little bit of detail to just share, it is not an easy task. So the demand certainly is there. The ability to respond to that demand, I think, will be the pacing item for some companies.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Myles Walton with Wolfe Research. You may proceed.
Myles Walton : Thanks. Good morning. Dave, it sounds like 2024 free cash flow is going to be comfortably at the high end of the range based on your comments. Is that right? And then maybe Ken, on the 2025 outlook for free cash flow, the guidance or the increase is about $600 million. But that looks like it's just covered with pension, CapEx and taxes. So is there a working capital or maybe burn off of B-21 that's offsetting earnings?
Ken Crews : I'll be happy to start, Myles, on 2024 and then hand it to Ken for a discussion of periods beyond. We didn't mean to indicate a direction toward either end of the free cash flow range for this year. As we noted, we've had a strong third quarter and year-to-date performance for free cash flow. I think if you look at prior year trends, you'd see a similar trend line through prior years of the quarterly progression such that Q4 is expected this year as it has been in the past, to be a strong free cash flow quarter. But we're not meaning to indicate a direction toward either end of the free cash flow range. We're pleased to continue to maintain that really strong range that reflects a strong growth year-over-year in 2024. So Ken, over to you for any follow-up discussion on '25.
Ken Crews : Sure. So from a working capital perspective, as we've communicated in the past, we expect that to be relatively flat. You'll see it elevated levels right now, and that's just timing as we get through quarter four with the sales profile, it will level to our historical norms. We expect that in 2025, and when we think about what is driving the cash flow expansion in 2025, I would put it in two primary drivers. The first is operating performance. So as we expand margins and we convert those margins to cash. The other major driver is the reductions in investment from our historical peaks. There are some minor benefits regarding R&D cash taxes as well as cash pension recoveries, but it's really going to be driven by operations and investment levels.
Myles Walton : All right. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. You may proceed.
Seth Seifman : Thanks very much. And good morning and congratulations to Dave and Ken. Kathy, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about within Defense Systems and the missiles and munitions, we saw some investments, some additional investment in solid rocket and mortars. And I think there's a sense that there's a lot of capacity coming into the solid rocket and mortar area. We saw kind of a surge in demand for missiles and munitions, but kind of how enduring is the demand level there? And so I wonder if you could talk a little bit about how you see that given the investments that you're making?
Kathy Warden: Yeah. We do see that not only the U.S. but multiple allies are likely to need to restock pile munitions. They have donated to Ukraine. And as a result, we believe that this higher demand signal is enduring for multiple years. We have invested to laying capacity, as you know, and increased capacity more than doubled at the point in moving toward a tripling of capacity with some U.S. government supported funding. And as we do that, we are working through our supply chain to ensure it's not just our capacity, but it's theirs as well to support the entire build process. As others are coming into the marketplace, I think there will come a time when we need to look at how much capacity is enough. We are certainly not at that place in our company at this point in time, the investments that we are making, we are committed to making. And we believe there will be plenty of demand for that capacity. But we'll continue to monitor it as we do any area where we're facilitating to ensure that we don't get out ahead of the demand signal.
Seth Seifman : Great. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Akers with Wells Fargo. You may proceed.
Matt Akers : Hey, good morning. And Dave good luck. Nice working with you. Can you talk about kind of CapEx trends longer term? I think, Kathy, you kind of mentioned in the opening remarks, 25 lower, but still sort of elevated versus historical levels. Is there room for that sort of move down either in absolute terms further out or as a percentage of sales and sort of what's driving that investment right now?
Kathy Warden: Yeah, I'll take that. We certainly want to ensure we're able to continue to invest in our growing business as well as return cash to shareholders. And it is true for the last several years, we have been investing more heavily in the business because the opportunities were there, and these were good opportunities that would create long-term profitable growth for the company. As we look over the horizon, we still see opportunities to grow the business, but not as capital intensive as what we have experienced and many of the growth opportunities that we have ahead of us this decade, we have now invested in to support the program and its move to production. So we naturally are seeing less pressure for CapEx in the out years of our plan. And we are going to be responsive to that by lowering our CapEx expenditure. I believe it will still be at a historical norm level, not below that, but just not as elevated as it has been in the past several years. And we've been specific about what that looks like in 2025. We've also said that it will come down further in 2026, but we haven't put more numbers to it beyond 2025.
Matt Akers : Got it. Thank you.
Ken Crews : We have time for one more question.
Operator: Our last question comes from Scott Mikus with Melius Research. You may proceed.
Scott Mikus : Good morning. Kathy, I wanted to ask, the Air Force seems very pleased with Northrop's execution on B-201. The program of record calls for 100 production units, but Air Force has publicly stated that it's desired inventory is for 150 B-21's. With the Air Force reevaluating at least the men part of NGAD. Could that free up to get your funding for the Air Force to get to that desired B-21 inventory of 150 units?
Kathy Warden: Well, Scott, I think that's exactly what the Air Force is looking at. They are undertaking a force structure design review and the Secretary has been open about looking at the various options they have for increasing Air Force size and has talked specifically about NGAD. And we know that B-21 is in the mix as well. It would be premature for me to suggest where that for structure review will end up. But I do think in the coming months, we may get a better indication from the Air Force as to how they're thinking about B-21 quantities in the long run. In the short run, we remain very focused on delivering them optionality. The performance that we are delivering gives them a capability that is in production now that is well below the cost target for the platform. And we believe that, that's the role of industry to give the government options as they think about their force structure.
Scott Mikus : Thanks for taking the question.
Kathy Warden: Thank you. Well, let me close by thanking the Northrop Grumman team for another outstanding quarter. They are executing our strategy. And importantly, that means that they're providing the capabilities our customers need in this incredibly dynamic environment that they face. I also just want to take a moment to thank Cai von Rumohr and George Shapiro neither of whom are on the call today. But I think you all know that retiring after respectively, 55 and 43 years of covering this industry, which is just amazing. And we've truly enjoyed working with them both and who miss their expertise and commitment to this industry. So -- in addition, I do want to congratulate Dave on his retirement, not quite 55 years in the industry, but the 5 years with our company have been truly outstanding and wish you all the best in your retirement. So thanks to all of you for joining our call. We look forward to talking to you again in January, if not before.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-07-25 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's Second Quarter 2024 Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. My name is Josh and I will be your operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Todd Ernst, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Ernst, please proceed.
Todd Ernst: Thanks Josh and good morning everyone and welcome to Northrop Grumman's second quarter 2024 conference call. Before we start, matters discussed on today's call, including guidance and outlooks for 2024 and beyond reflect the company's judgment based on information available at the time of this call. They constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks uncertainties, including those noted in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties may cause actual company results to differ materially. Today's call will include non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to our GAAP results in our earnings release. And also, we will refer to a presentation that is posted on our Investor Relations website. On the call today are Kathy Warden, our Chair, CEO and President; Dave Keffer, our CFO. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kathy. Kathy?
Kathy Warden: Thanks, Todd. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. As you saw from this morning's earnings release, we delivered excellent operating results again this quarter, building on our momentum from the first quarter. Our company's ability to respond to U.S. and international customer requirements with a wide range of advanced capabilities continues to drive strong growth, with sales up 7% in the quarter and 8% year-to-date. And our team's solid program performance, along with cost management discipline, led to operating income growth of 13% in the second quarter. The combined strength of our top and bottom line operating results was the primary driver of our 19% EPS growth. And in addition, we delivered robust free cash flow, which is up over $500 million compared to the first half of last year. Based on these strong first half results and confidence in our team's ability to deliver on continued robust demand in the second half, we are increasing our 2024 revenue and EPS guidance. The breadth and depth of our portfolio is an important differentiator, particularly when coupled with the effectiveness of our strategy in aligning our resources to anticipate and deliver on our customers' needs. Given this, I'm going to take the next couple of minutes to provide important context on our portfolio. When you step back and look at the key components of our business, you'll see that 85% of our sales come from a diverse collection of technology advanced capabilities, such as electronic, communications, crewed and uncrewed aircraft, space payloads, advanced weapons, command and control systems and other product areas, which are critical to global security. The capabilities we provide often as a supplier are in the nation's most advanced space air, land, sea and undersea platforms. In the last several years, we've been selected through dozens of competition to develop and build differentiating technologies that will provide an advantage to the U.S. and our allies through the 2030s. The remaining 15% of our sales is comprised of two prime programs in support of the nation's strategic deterrent, of course, that's Sentinel and B-21, with each generating a high single-digit percentage of our revenue today, and we expect that balance to continue for several years. With the recent realignment of our SCS division to our Defense Systems sector, we have four strong and differentiated segments that are more equal in size with each having multiple avenues for profitable growth. Our business is well aligned with the U.S. National Defense strategy. And as I've outlined in recent years, we've won significant roles on long-term programs that address the threat environment of today and are expected to do so for the next several decades. In addition, we continue to expand exportable product offerings, and we are developing our international partner and supplier base to position us for the growing international markets. We have also invested to increase our capacity to deliver the quantities of rocket motors, armaments and air and missile defense capabilities needed by the U.S. and our allies to defend freedom and deter aggression around the globe. Examples of this growth include the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System or GMLRS, where our year-to-date revenue has grown by nearly 60%. Additionally, we were awarded over $500 million in contract for ammunition that we will begin delivering in the third quarter. And we see additional demand for international ammunition opportunities in the coming quarters. Overall, the key takeaway is that the breadth of our portfolio, our alignment to the key priorities for the U.S. and our allies and our role on each leg of the U.S. strategic trial provides us visibility into avenues for our business to grow even if U.S. budget growth slows. And as we've discussed frequently over the last two years, we're not just focused on top line growth, we're taking deliberate actions to enhance profitability through digital enablement, productivity, supplier management and cost efficiency. As we look at the remainder of this year and next, we expect solid growth across the portfolio to continue, particularly in areas such as weapon systems, advanced electronics and aeronautics. International sales are also progressing from our pipeline to our backlog and are expected to contribute to increased sales and profitability. Our outlook is supported by the national security spending environment. In the U.S., the fiscal year 2025 defense budget is moving through the appropriations process with recent markups by Congress. We were pleased to see the Senate Arm Services Committee increased the FY 2025 top line by $25 billion and we're encouraged by continued support for investment in defense. Northrop Grumman programs broadly and particularly the B-21 Sentinel in Colombia, which provide the basis for the U.S. strategic deterrent continue to receive strong support, bolstering our view that we're well positioned in this such an environment. Given the importance of the triad to the nation's deterrence, I'll provide an update on two legs of the triad for which Northrop Grumman is the prime industry partner to the Department of Defense. So, starting with Sentinel. Earlier this month, the DoD submitted to Congress certification of the of the Sentinel program as part of the Nunn-McCurdy process. This certification validates the need for the land-based leg of the triad and continued confidence in the Sentinel weapon system, the critical role it plays in safeguarding global security. DoD and the Air Force are working to restructure program to reflect the latest cost and schedule estimates. The majority of the cost growth is expected to occur in the production phase of the program, which is beyond the current EMD phase and outside of the future year's defense program or fight it. We continue to execute on our existing EMD contract, which includes the design, development and testing of the full system. We are partnered with the Air Force on completing the design of all aspects of the system and how many of the systems components already in development and tests, including all three stages of the missile, command and launch subsystems for launch activation, security and systems monitoring as well as transportation and support equipment. The progress we've made on the program is significant, and we remain committed to partnering with the U.S. Air Force to identify ways to reduce the costs associated with feeling this system. So, turning to the air leg of the triad. The B-21 is progressing well through the testing program, and as you know, has entered low rate initial production. The team continues to perform exceptionally well, and we remain within our schedule and cost estimates. As we recently shared, B-21 test pilots report that the aircraft is flying like the simulator, which is another indication that our digital environment has effectively predicted the performance of aircraft, thus reducing new discovery and risk. For these reasons and more, we continue to believe in the significant value this program will create for customers and shareholders over time. It's important to note that while the B-21 program is very important, it contributes less than 10% of our total sales, and we expect that to remain the case through the decade. Assuming stable economic conditions and continued strong performance by our team, we also expect program margin dollars to grow annually from here as we complete the EMD program and for five lots of production move into advanced production awards on the more profitable lab and beyond and add modernization and sustainment revenue to the program. As you can see, our portfolio includes a compelling mix of technology-driven capabilities and franchise programs that are well aligned to the evolving needs of all our customers. As a result, we've grown our organic revenue at greater than 5% compound annual growth over the past five years, including 5% growth projected in our increased 2024 guidance. We also continue to rapidly expand our cash flows, including generating over $1 billion of free cash in the second quarter. Based on the strength of portfolio, backlog and performance trends, we are reiterating our long-term cash flow outlook, which assumes a greater than 15% compound annual growth rate through 2026. To support growth in our business, we're maintaining our investments and capabilities across the company. We continue to target $1.8 billion in capital expenditures this year, which is around 4.5% of revenue and well above the industry average. Including R&D, we're investing approximately $3 billion in our portfolio. At the same time, we're efficiently returning capital to shareholders, including $2.3 billion in the first half of the year. In May, we increased the dividend by 10%. This is our 21st consecutive annual increase, as we continue to focus on delivering competitive sustainable dividend growth. Before I turn the call over to Dave to provide more details on our financial performance and outlook, I'd like to thank our team for another great quarter, as we continue to execute on our long-term strategy. We have an outstanding portfolio, a high-performing team and a bright outlook for the future. So with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Dave.
Dave Keffer: Thanks Kathy and good morning everyone. Before covering our Q2 results and outlook, I'd like to take a moment and provide some context around our financials, given the recent segment realignment. As Kathy noted, the Strategic Deterrent Systems division, which includes Sentinel and other related programs moved from our Space Systems segment to our Defense Systems segment effective July 1st. Second quarter results have been reported in the prior organizational structure given the effective date of the realignment, but we've provided a table in the earnings release and earnings slides, the recast sales and margin for current and historical periods under the new organizational structure. Moving forward, we will report third quarter results and beyond under the new structure and our updated financial guidance is also under the new structure. So with that, let's get into our second quarter results. Starting with demand. Q2 net awards totaled over $15 billion, generating a book-to-bill ratio of 1.5 times and increasing our backlog to over $83 billion. As a result of our strong year-to-date performance, we now expect a full year book-to-bill ratio of more than one time sales. Turning to our top line results on Slide 4 in our earnings deck. Second quarter sales were $10.2 billion, an increase of 7% compared to the same period in 2023. All four segments generated year-over-year growth again in Q2. Looking ahead to the second half of the year, we expect a gradual ramp in our quarterly sales profile with Q3 sales projected to be roughly in line with Q2. Aeronautics' second quarter sales increased by 14%, with similar drivers to Q1, higher volume on B-21, F-35 and Triton again led the way. At DS sales grew by 7%, primarily due to higher volume on certain military ammunition programs and higher volume from the timing of materials on GMLRS. Mission Systems sales increased by 5% with continued strong growth on advanced microelectronics programs, our Marine Systems portfolio and SEWIP. And at Space, sales were up by 2%, driven by growth on the SDA transport layer programs and GEM 63 solid rocket motors, partially offset by lower sales in the restricted space portfolio. Bottom-line results were also very strong with segment operating income up 5% year-over-year and total operating income up 13%. These results reflect another solid quarter of overall program performance as well as lower corporate unallocated expense. AS operating income grew by 6%, generating an operating margin rate of 10% for the second straight quarter. These results have provided an example of how strong program performance, focused productivity initiatives and indirect cost efficiencies can generate margin rates at these levels even as we ramp on B-21. Speaking of B-21, there were no significant changes to our LRIP EAC again this quarter. There are currently 21 aircraft in baseline for the first five LRIP lots and another 19 production aircraft subsequent to these for, which we have not to exceed or NTE pricing. These prices were set in 2018, and given that the production for those lots was well into the future, the average unit NTE price was set above the average LRIP price. The NTE lots include an economic price adjustment clause to protect against certain inflationary pressures. Pricing, final quantities and terms and conditions have yet to be fully negotiated for these additional aircraft. Based on our current projections, we expect to be able to execute the NTE lots profitably. As you think about the trajectory of the overall program, we expect to begin work on long lead items related to the NTE lots in 2026. Overall production will continue to ramp through the second half of the decade. And we expect that production sales will become larger than EMD beginning in 2026. Other B-21 efforts for modernization and sustainment will also begin to grow over the next couple of years and are expected to generate profit rates that are accretive to the overall program. Taking all these factors together, we currently project that margin dollars for the overall program will gradually expand going forward, as Kathy outlined. Defense Systems had a particularly strong quarter, with operating income up 23% and a margin rate of 13.5%. Higher net EAC adjustments and favorable changes in contract mix contributed to their significant year-over-year improvement. At Mission Systems, operating margin rate was 13%, which was lower than Q2 of last year. Similar to Q1, this was a result of lower net EAC adjustments and changes in contract mix towards more cost-type contracts. While margin rates at current levels remain very competitive, they are below MS' historical performance, and we continue to see opportunities to improve margins in the second half of the year. These improvements will be driven by continued investments we're making our factories to improve performance and increase production volumes as well as from business mix shifting to more fixed price work. Space had another solid quarter of operating performance, with operating income increasing 14% from the prior year, generating a margin rate of 9.1%. We've seen improvements in space program performance for multiple quarters now as a result of deliberate actions we've taken in the business. Moving to earnings per share on Slide 6. Q2 diluted EPS was $6.36. This represents an increase of 19% from the prior year, driven by continued strong growth in segment performance as well as from higher net pension income and lower corporate unallocated expense. Rounding out our Q2 results is cash flow. We had an excellent quarter of cash generation with Q2 free cash flow of $1.1 billion, up 80% compared to our results from Q2 of last year and on track with our expectations for the full year. We returned approximately $900 million to investors in Q2 via dividends and share repurchases, while also continuing to make strategic investments in our business. Slide 7 includes our latest segment guidance based on our new organizational structure. We are increasing our sales guidance at both AS and MS, neither of which were affected by the sector realignment. AS is now projected in the high $11 billion and MS is projected in the mid-$11 billion. The increases are driven by the strength of their year-to-date results and expectations for the rest the year. As we indicated on our Q1 call, Aeronautics sales are expected to flatten out in the second half of the year based on timing of materials and production schedules. We've also updated our margin expectations for AS and MS. We now expect a margin rate at Aeronautics of mid to high 9%, reflecting our ability to generate strong margins across mix of mature production programs and early-stage development programs. The increase at AS offsets the decrease in margin rate at MS, which is now projected at low to mid 14%. At DS, we've increased our sales guidance this year to roughly $9 billion. This reflects the realignment of the SDS division to DS, which is expected to generate sales this year of roughly $2.7 billion. The increase also reflects our expectations for higher sales volume associated with ammunition and weapons replenishment. We expect Space sales to be relatively flat this year, projected in the mid to high $11 billion range and to be down somewhat in 2025. This profile is driven by the removal of NGI and the restricted program during 2024, which collectively had a run rate of about $1.5 billion in annualized sales. Those headwinds affect both this year and next, of which the larger impact will be experienced in 2025. We expect the rest of the space portfolio to continue to grow. Overall, we expect a relatively stable level of margin dollars in space in 2025 as the margin rate grows and offsets pressure from lower volume. Space's guidance also reflects higher intercompany sales, primarily associated with propulsion activities in support of the Sentinel program. This also has the effect of increasing company level eliminations to roughly $2.7 billion. We expect a margin rate at DS of approximately 10% this year and a low 10% rate at space given the shifts in the portfolio. In total, we now expect company level sales of $41 billion to $41.4 billion, representing 5% growth at the midpoint. We continue to expect segment OM dollars to grow at roughly the same rate as sales. We've lowered our expectations for corporate unallocated expense to $150 million based on year-to-date trends. We continue to expect corporate unallocated expense be weighted toward the second half of the year, consistent with prior years. We've increased our expectation for the federal tax rate to the mid-17% and slightly lowered our expectation for interest expense to roughly $650 million. As we've noted in prior quarters, we're monitoring for any favorable or unfavorable updates in tax legislation, audits and appeals processes that by their nature, are not factored into our guidance. And based on the latest plans for a higher volume of share repurchases, we've lowered our estimate for weighted average shares outstanding to the mid-$147 million. Altogether, our strong performance and outlook results in an increase of $0.45 to our diluted EPS range. We had a strong first half of the year, and we're looking forward to continuing to create value in the second half and beyond. So, with that, let's open up the call for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.
Kristine Liwag: Hey, good morning Kathy and Dave.
Kathy Warden: Good morning.
Kristine Liwag: I want to understand a little better the 19 B-21s under not to exceed pricing agreements. I mean I understand that the ceiling for the average unit price is higher than the first 21 aircraft, but how do we get comfortable that these next 19 aircraft are indeed profitable as final pricing is yet to be determined. And then also as a follow-up, I think you both mentioned the slot 6 is more profitable. And I just want to clarify, this mean absolute positive margin on the program? And -- or is that a relative comment to the previous slots I just want to understand the dynamics a little bit better on the B-21? Thank you.
Dave Keffer: Sure, Kristine, happy to clarify a few of those points. As you've noted, the NTE lots that follow the first five LRIP are currently projected to be more profitable than the LRIP lots. And to clarify that further, we are projecting a positive profit rate in Lot 6 based on our current projections. So, to your point, those NTE prices are set higher than the prices that are expected for the first five lots and with cost efficiencies that we're working hard to drive and program performance and productivity efforts very much in progress. Our current projections indicate positive profitability for those lots.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Deuschle with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.
Scott Deuschle: Hey good morning. Thanks for taking the question.
Kathy Warden: Good morning Scott.
Scott Deuschle: Dave, just to follow-up on Kristine's question. Is the difference on B-21 units, 22 to 40 that they have both a higher average base price and the EPA cost protection or units 1 to 22 also have that EPA protection?
Dave Keffer: I think you're right, those are both important points about the NTE lots that that they are set higher. They also do include an EPA clause that is one we're monitoring carefully. So, both are important to keep in mind as eventual pricing and terms and quantities are finalized for those portions of the program.
Scott Deuschle: Okay, great. And then, Kathy, there was a news article a while back about the issue the industry faces and sourcing ammonium percolate for making solid rocket motors. Is that something you guys have made some good headway on. And based on your comment on GMLRS output being up 60%, it sounds like the answer is yes, but just curious for your perspective. Thanks.
Kathy Warden: Yes, Scott, thank you for the question. We did recognize this as a constraining factor in our supply chain for solid rocket motors four or five years ago, and the team brought forward a business case, which we funded to create an alternate supply, and we have done so, which gives us more confidence in our ability to manage that supply. We also, of course, are buying IP from other sources as well. We are not the single supplier of our own AP, but we did add to the overall production capacity, which has improved our ability for predictability on SRM, solid rocket motors.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rob Stallard with Vertical Research. You may proceed.
Rob Stallard: Thanks so much. Good morning.
Kathy Warden: Good morning.
Rob Stallard: Kathy, on Sentinel, there's been some reports that the customer is not happy with the way this program has been progressing so far. And I was wondering, first of all, what sort of risk is there that Northrop could be on the hook for additional charges on this program? And then secondly, what you're trying to do practically to improve the cost profile on Sentinel? Thank you.
Kathy Warden: Yes. Well, thank you. The DoD did a thorough review of a program as part of the [Indiscernible] process, and they were very transparent about the results of that review. For those of you who haven't seen it, they did a press release, they conducted media interviews about a week and a half ago to share those results and they met with many members of Congress. And in that process, they have not pointed to industry performance as the cause of cost growth. The things that they have pointed to include inflation, obviously, particularly as we look at the deployment cost, there's a big construction component of this job, and also the assumptions that were made many years ago that underestimated the complexity of the program. And those were two primary costs growth drivers that were identified. We are working with the Air Force to identify ways to perform better than those cost estimates. We will continue to do that. We are looking at everything from design alternatives that they have referenced in the restructure of the program to ensuring we have the right team in place to execute on every part of the program in that deployment and production phase. And, of course, we are continuing bolster our own staff and systems engineering on the program. But the reality is that most aspects of the program are progressing very well, and the Air Force has publicly made those comments – we are very focused on the ground in the structure, which is the piece of the program that is driving the vast majority the cost growth, and that's what our focus will continue to be through the restructure.
Rob Stallard: Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Gursky with Citi. You may proceed.
Jason Gursky: Yes, Kathy, just a quick follow-up to that last commentary. There was an article yesterday with some comments from somebody up on the hill, senator; I think that did mention Northrop. So, I'm just kind of curious if we can some context about your recent visit, it sounds like you made up to the hill and why you'd have somebody in the Congress making some comments and a little bit contrary to what you just mentioned.
Kathy Warden: Well, I'm not going to comment on any individual meetings that I had, but I have had a number of meetings with members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, and they have generally been very supportive of the need for the program and our team's role in that program. And I will also just note that the Department of Defense speak for the program and their findings on the Nunn-McCurdy and have spoken very clearly about that. The final thing I'll suggest is that while not everyone is a supporter of the land-based leg of the triad, you can look at the vote and the appropriations, which have fully funded the program, and it's more reflective of the landscape I painted, which is broad-based congressional support for the program and our role in it.
Jason Gursky: That’s helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. You may proceed.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Good morning, Kathy, Dave and Todd. Thank you. Maybe if we could just talk about your Mission Systems business. It's been a solid double-digit business, and you step down this quarter. How do we think about that mix impact lower EACs and there's 100 basis points of ramp in the second half versus H1. How does that evolve? And how do we think about that longer term?
Dave Keffer: The way I would characterize that is, I think, first of all, you've touched on a key point that the mix in MS has shifted over the last few years to be more heavily cost type in nature. We think that mix will shift back in the direction of more fixed price work over the next several years. A lot of the growth in MS in recent years has been large cost-type development programs, leading technology efforts across its multiple mission areas. And as a result, its cost type mix has gone from the mid-30% back in 2021 to the mid-40% this year, gradually that will shift downward over time to include the second half of this year when consistent with last year, some of our greater sales volume in the second half in MS will be driven by programs that are more predominantly fixed price in nature, and that will blend the mix upward even as soon as the second half of this year. But I think another important point is the set of deliberate actions we're taking to improve productivity and performance and cost efficiency in our Mission Systems business as we're scaling to meet increased demand in our factories. And improvements there are being felt already in the business and are another driver of our confidence in second half margins for MS being higher than those we've delivered in this half. We're working closely with our suppliers and our production teams in MS to continue to deliver on those efforts and expect progress in the second half and beyond.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. You may proceed.
Seth Seifman: Hey, thanks very much and good morning. Wanted to dig in a little bit on the Space decline, you talked about for next year. It looks like off of the revised numbers, maybe it's a modest decline this year. When we think about what's coming next year and the ability to grow in I think you talked earlier, Kathy, about growing again in 2025. The ability to grow in 2025 relative to the 5% growth rate that you're expecting for this year. Is it possible to make any comments about that at this point?
Kathy Warden: Sure. With the increase in our guidance this quarter, we expect 5% growth again this year, following a period, as I said, of about 5% compound annual growth for the last five years. So, looking forward, we'd expect solid growth across three of our four segments with the strong demand that I talked about earlier in the call, balanced across the portfolio. Space is likely to be exception to that next year. We are guiding around flat this year and down modestly net. And that's due largely to the impact of NCI and the restricted program that we talked about earlier this year being canceled, and then we do expect space to return to growth in 2026. So it's too soon to provide a detailed guide for 2025 at a company level, but that gives you a sense of the dynamics that we're expecting in the various segments. And with the broad-based portfolio that we have, the slight decline that we expect in sales in Space next year do not change our outlook for the company as a whole.
Seth Seifman: Okay. Okay. Thanks. And then maybe as a quick follow-up. In Aeronautics, we've seen some fairly strong margin performance early this year and led to the guidance increase? I guess, are there specific things to point to for the second half that will pull that that down below 10%.
Dave Keffer: Sure, Seth. Happy to comment on further. To your point, it was a really solid first half of the year and a solid second quarter for the AS business, top and bottom line performance were strong. And really since the beginning of the year, we've been projecting and noting that sales growth rate would moderate a bit in the second half of the year because of the timing of top line items in aeronautics, supplier deliveries and such, both on B-21 and on programs like F-35 that were going to lead to higher volume in the first half of the year than we saw a year ago. So, that's where we've seen the really strong year-over-year growth rates in the first half. We've been able to increase our guide for both sales and margin rate for the year. But to your point, it will involve slightly slower growth and slightly lower margin rates in the second half. We have initially guided 9.5% for the year and have now increased that rate because of the first two quarters at 10%. So we're continuing to project a really strong rate for the year. And I think that's evidence of the fact that we have a diversified mix of programs in AS and programs like our support for F-35 as well as Triton E-2D and others are in healthy production levels where we're doing a great job for our customers and delivering strong results for investors.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Gavin Parsons with UBS. You may proceed.
Gavin Parsons: Thanks. Good morning.
Kathy Warden: Good morning.
Gavin Parsons: I appreciate all the detail on B-21. That's really helpful, especially in terms of EBIT dollars growth. When do you foresee the peak margin rate headwind occurring from that program?
Kathy Warden: So Gavin, what we have shared today suggests our modeling of the program would see increased dollar growth from here and on earnings and modest sales growth. So you can anticipate, even though we didn't specifically outlined that we are at the trough of margin rate performance on the program in our current modeling.
Gavin Parsons: Got it. That's helpful. And then I guess on the expectation for equitable adjustment Lot 6 or beyond. I think there was some expectation that there might be one on the first five LRIPs. Is it more contractual now on the board expectation?
Kathy Warden: So the difference with the NTE pricing is that the pricing itself has an economic price adjustment clause in it for the EPA contracts, which, of course, we have not negotiated or definitized. The LRIP did not have an EPA clause. So any inflation relief that we get on those contracts is additive to the term.
Gavin Parsons: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with TD Cowen. You may proceed.
Cai von Rumohr: Thanks so much. So help me understand on B-21. I mean, you took close to $1.6 billion charge over five lots, that's roughly $300 million a lot. So I assume that's moving from about zero last year up to $300 million negative. How do you get enough profit to offset that? Or when you talk about profit dollars and improving, are you talking from an accrued basis where you've taken the charge already?
Dave Keffer: Right. Cai, it's the latter. We took that charge last year. So we're talking about the anticipated results from the program going forward.
Cai von Rumohr: Got it. Thank you very much. And then secondly, they're talking about restructuring the Sentinel program. Is that likely to be, in your opinion, Kathy, an opportunity or a risk for Northrop Grumman?
Kathy Warden: At this point, Cai, what I would say is that the cost growth that is being talked about and which drove the Nunn-McCurdy is mostly outside of the EMD phase of the of the program, which, course, is what we are on contract for and therefore, what our financial projections reflect. And we do reflect modest cost growth that we're expecting in the EMD contract in our financials. So, you see that reflected in the Q2 booking rate. And I would say we've taken a cautious approach on our booking rate at this point as we normally do. at the beginning of the program. And as we perform and achieve more percentage performance milestones over the course of the program, we would expect that booking rate to improve.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Harned with Bernstein. You may proceed.
Doug Harned: Good morning. Thank you. Kathy, when you talked -- you had a really big quarter this year for bookings after last quarter was pretty soft. And you're looking at being above 1.0 for the year. How should we think about outlook this year in terms of bookings? And I'd say in two dimensions. One is growth, U.S. versus international. And then second, which segments are we looking at where you expect to see that over the -- see some good growth over the next two quarters?
Kathy Warden: Yes. So, as Dave said, we are now expecting book-to-bill in the year over 1 after a very strong second quarter. We do see lumpiness in awards, as we've talked about before, but consistently has been performing on an annual basis with book-to-bill over 1. And this year, it is again expected to be reflecting our mix of domestic versus international sales because awards are going to be strong in both categories, with international bookings being stronger this year than they have been in the past in domestic bookings remaining strong. In terms of the segments that are going to drive that, we've seen it shift more to our shorter-cycle businesses. So strong bookings are more concentrated now in our new defense systems and in Mission Systems than they are in AS and space. But of course, I'll point that in both those segments, we've had strong -- they've been the key driver of strong bookings in past and so they still have a really solid backlog.
Doug Harned: Yes, I guess part of what I was getting at is if you're looking at -- we're looking at still unfortunately fairly flat budgets in the U.S., but a lot of growth outside, should we expect to see over the next couple of years any kind of a shift in mix with a higher percentage of international sales?
Kathy Warden: I would say we are more international sales than we are expecting our international sales to grow at a faster rate than our domestic. But also when you look at bookings and the strength of our alignment with the National Defense Strategy and the prioritization, particularly of triad and the growth that we expect on all three of the programs as they move through development into production. We do believe that they will be well-supported in the budget, and we'll see them take more share of the budget overall, even though each one of them is well below 1% of the overall DoD budget, they are well-prioritized within the spending profile.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Myles Walton with Wolfe Research. You may proceed.
Myles Walton: Thanks. Good morning. Just had a quick follow-up question for you, Kathy, in your remarks earlier in the prepared remarks, you talked about high single-digit percentage of revenue on the Sentinel and B-21 and staying consistent with that over next several years. And I guess, I was expecting that the B-21 would drip into double digits within that time period, understanding that Sentinel might have a smoother or slower growth rate. Is that correct or incorrect in this assessment?
Kathy Warden: No. And it's why we included it to clarify that even though you see budget profile from department that show growth, that includes things that aren't on our contract as the government needs to staff up to be able to test to be able to support, to be able to build a sustainment to organization to house the aircraft as we deliver them. So there are a lot of things in that budget beyond our contract value. And with the dynamics that I described with EMD moving toward completion over the next handful of years and meeting IOC on the program with the production meeting its quantity level and then starting to flatten off. And with modernization and sustainment coming online, that whole mix keeps us generally in that high single-digit range, especially as the rest of the portfolio growth as well.
Myles Walton: Okay. Very good. And then the space booking -- excuse me, space performance in the quarter, it sounded from your tone that it had improved. Are we now back to positive EACs or are we just less negative EACs that we're seeing?
Dave Keffer: I can take that one. The EACs for Q2 for space were less negative than the last couple of quarters, clear improvement there in performance in the business, still a few small negative items. But clearly, as you saw from the year-over-year booking -- or margin rate improvement and the overall margin rate that we're now expecting for the full year in space, there's been demonstrable progress there, really related to the actions we've been taking for the last year to improve program performance, deliver cost efficiencies, deliver affordability for customers as we do it. So certainly a good news part of the story there.
Myles Walton: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matt Akers with Wells Fargo. You may proceed.
Matt Akers: Yes. Hey, good morning. Thanks for the question. Can you comment on the Navy new fire, the FXX, just what you're hearing on timing there and if you still have plenty to bid on that program?
Kathy Warden: Yes. We have not received any updates that would suggest the Navy is changing their approach. They are in competition now for selection to occur next year. And in terms of our overall collection of opportunities continue to believe that the Department of Defense will move forward with sixth generation platforms. The timing is a bit influx on many of them as they sort out budget priorities. But we are confident that we're well positioned when and if they do move forward.
Matt Akers: Great. Thanks. And if I could do a follow-up. I guess Spirit AeroSystems is a supplier on B-21 -- any thoughts around the acquisition there with Boeing? And if there's a chance you would bring that work kind of in house?
Kathy Warden: Yes. I'm not going to comment on specific discussions that we've been having with Spirit. But generally, we acknowledge that they are a supplier, and we have agreements in place with them that we would any owner of the company to adhere to as we move forward.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global. You may proceed.
Pete Skibitski: Yes. Good morning guys. Cathy, I think it was on the last call, you talked about an increasing amount of Triton export opportunities. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of timing for when those might get signed off on and maybe size some of the opportunities? Thanks.
Kathy Warden: Yes. So we are excited that both NATO and Norway have expressed interest in Triton, and we are hopeful that announcements will be coming shortly on both. And as we look to build Triton for the U.S. and Australia, this simply adds to the production line outlook for Triton through the decade. And so we had envisioned this day coming where more countries would get the opportunity to see Triton once it was fielded has a tremendous ability to surveil large areas of ocean. You can think of the relevance to that in the Pacific, which is what was attractive to Australia and the U.S. Navy, but of course, in the Arctic, this is an area of great importance as well, which is driving to NATO and the Norwegian interest.
Pete Skibitski: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn with Melius Research. You may proceed.
Scott Mikus: Hi. Scott Mikus on for Rob Spingarn. Kathy, I wanted to ask about the Sentinel program. It had an 81% increase in cost, but the DoD's Cape office said that their confidence interval on that estimate was only about 50%. So if the estimates end up being higher or lower, can you talk about opportunities where you think you can lower the cost of the program? And then as a follow-up, although nuclear modernization is a high priority, budgets aren't unlimited. So how concerned are you that cost growth in Sentinel could result in it being truncated or potentially B-21 end up being a bill payer with the Air Force's budget?
Kathy Warden: Yes. A couple of things to frame for you in answering those questions. The first is a reminder that the cost growth that is projected is indeed that a projection over a very long period of time. It covers not just work that we're doing right now to design, develop and tests, which will largely be through the remainder of this decade. The majority of those cost growth projections come for the fielding building out the missile silos for the system, 450 of them, and that doesn't happen really until the next decade. So that's why there's so much uncertainty. It's like any of us sitting here and trying to project what costs might look like 10 to 15 years from now, and that's what's baked into those estimates. The second part of your question is around the 80% growth. There's so much of that is well into the future. There are still decisions that the Air Force can make today that can drive solutions that reduce that cost projection. And that is what they're doing in the restructuring, looking at those options, and we are partnering with them to do that and very committed to help them do that. And, of course, on many of Northrop Grumman's program, we are performing well-below the government's independent cost estimates, which is what these are. These are not industry's estimates. These are the government cost estimates. And this is not growth on the current contract. This is projections of future growth. So with all of that in mind, there is time here to work through a number factors to determine what the actual cost growth would be and how that gets incorporated into future year defense programs, but it is not expected to have a significant impact in the next five years, and the Air Force has made that clear.
Scott Mikus: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Peter Arment with Baird. You may proceed.
Peter Arment: Thanks. Good morning, Kathy and Dave. Thanks for all the incremental details on B-21 super helpful. Just Dave, quickly on working capital, just dynamics going forward here and then how we're thinking about that as it rolls into 2025 just given all the growth that you guys are enjoying?
Dave Keffer: Sure. Clearly, a really strong Q2 for free cash flow performance, working capital very much an integral part of that. I think it's a good opportunity to take a step back then and look at the rest of this year and beyond? And what's factored into our multiyear outlook and our guidance for this year. And for working capital, the answer is essentially that our expectations are pretty flat that we're already performing at a very high level, very strong level for working capital and that we're not anticipating additional efficiencies nor are we anticipating erosion to those levels. So, when we talk about a 15% plus free cash flow CAGR from 2023 to 2026. That is not driven by further working capital efficiencies. It's driven by the expansion of operating profits as we continue to grow the top line, and we deliver on margin expansion opportunities. CapEx is at peak levels this year as it was last that will decline going forward, both in real dollars and clearly as a percentage of sales toward our longer-term target in the 3% range. And then we should see modestly stronger CAS pension recoveries as we showed in our latest projections earlier this year based on the actuarial environment today. And then the Section 174 impact on cash taxes will continue to decline each year. So that combination of factors is what leads to the 15-plus percent free cash flow growth in our outlook and working capital is essentially a flat element of that outlook.
Peter Arment: Appreciate the details. Thanks.
Dave Keffer: You bet.
Todd Ernst: And Josh, we have time for one more question.
Operator: Thank you. And our final question comes from David Strauss with Barclays. You may proceed.
David Strauss: Thanks for squeezing me and I appreciate all the additional color on B-21, very helpful. Kathy, can you -- you've talked about the company eventually getting back to this 12% margin range. Today, you're at 11. You talked about B-21 today, not really being much of a headwind as we think about margins going forward. Can you talk about that progression back to 12%, how you see that kind of playing out over the next couple years?
Kathy Warden: Sure. So, we've talked about several factors. The first is getting the macroeconomic headwinds behind us related to inflation flowing through our contracts, the disruption and challenges that we've had with supply chain deliveries, and those are largely getting behind us, although we do still have some contracts that is flowing through, and we're seeing those impacts, as we talked about in Mission Systems today. But as those headwinds dissipate, then it really is about the strength of the portfolio shining through in operating results. And you're starting to see that take hold. What I would say is that from a cost efficiency standpoint, the team is making sure that the business is sized appropriately and everything from human capital to facilities to our infrastructure. We also are investing in digital enablement, as you know, which is a tailwind to program performance as we've demonstrated on B-21 with our ability to adhere to modeling that predicts future and then hit that performance in the product, that is derisking our programs and driving improved margin opportunity. And then some more structural items like the mix shift that we spoke about on the call, our cost plus business, which we've had a heavy concentration of here in these last few years, including programs like Sentinel with lower booking rates, which will over time move toward fixed price and more profitable programs. And then, of course, international, which is a portfolio tailwind as more of our business comes from international sources. So it's that full combination of paths that we are working. We're showing progress on each as we move forward, and it bolsters our confidence that we can drive this business to another 100 basis points of margin performance over the decade.
David Strauss: Thanks. If you sit here today, would you expect margins to tick up next year off the 11% level?
Kathy Warden: I would.
David Strauss: Thanks. Appreciate it.
Kathy Warden: Thank you. All right. So, with that, I'd like to conclude by once again thank you to team for a fantastic quarter. And in particular, I want to recognize Mark Taylor who is retiring from our company tomorrow after a distinguished Northrop Grumman career and over a decade on our executive leadership team. And also I want to note that in the coming months, Dave, Todd and I look forward to introducing Ken Cruse, who is here with us in the room to our investor community as our incoming CFO effective October 1. So in the meantime, we look forward to talking with you in October and seeing you over the course of the summer, and thank again for joining our call today.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-04-25 10:10:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's First Quarter 2024 Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. My name is Josh, and I will be your operator today.
 [Operator Instructions] 
 I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Todd Ernst, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Ernst, please proceed. 
Todd Ernst: Thanks, Josh, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's First Quarter 2024 Conference Call. We'll refer to a presentation that is posted on our IR website this morning. Before we start, matters discussed on today's call, including guidance and outlooks for 2024 and beyond, reflect the company's judgment based on information available at the time of this call. They constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to safe harbor provisions of federal securities laws. 
 Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, including those noted in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties may cause actual company results to differ materially. Today's call will include non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to our GAAP results in our earnings release. And on the call today are Kathy Warden, our Chair, CEO and President; and Dave Keffer, our CFO. 
 At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kathy. Kathy? 
Kathy Warden: Thank you, Todd. Good morning, everyone. It's so good to have you joining us today. So earlier this morning, we released our first quarter results. And as you can see, we are off to a strong start to the year with broad-based growth across our portfolio. The team's relentless execution of our strategy, which includes technology leadership aligned to our customers' priorities and a laser focus on performance has positioned us for continued success. Growing global demand for our capabilities led to an exceptional 9% year-over-year increase in Q1 sales, driven by growth in all 4 of our sectors.
 The productivity and cost efficiency measures we've been implementing are gaining traction, and our program performance in the quarter was strong, resulting in segment operating margin dollars increasing by 10%. Operating profit expansion, along with the lower share count helped to drive 15% EPS growth. Overall, our first quarter performance was in line with or better than our expectations, and we are reaffirming our 2024 company level guidance. Global demand for our products continues to be robust, fueled by rising defense budgets and our market position. We're pleased that an agreement was reached on the U.S. fiscal year 2024 defense budget, which includes support for our key programs and represents a 6% growth in investment accounts over 2023.
 In March, the administration released the 2025 defense budget and Future Years Defense Program or FYDP. And these also were consistent with our expectations. We continue to see robust support for our program portfolio in areas that include nuclear modernization, microelectronics, advanced weapons in space. Together, the appropriations in FYDP give us confidence in our longer-term outlook even if we experience a somewhat slower top line growth environment for the U.S. defense budget in the short term. 
 As we look beyond the domestic market, we continue to see numerous new international opportunities as well. These span a wide range of capabilities across our portfolio, and they provide an additional avenue for sustainable and profitable growth. In the first quarter, Poland signed a letter of acceptance with the U.S. government for an additional implementation of our IBCS product line, known as [ Narav ]. This represents the short-range air and missile defense portion of Poland's missile defense architecture, and it will augment the medium-range portion, which is currently being deployed. In addition to Poland, we see an IBCS pipeline now of approximately $10 billion from numerous countries who are considering this joint battle management system. 
 Another important suite of international opportunities for Northrop Grumman is sensor modernization of fourth-generation aircraft. This includes our IVEWS electronic warfare offering, which leverages the U.S. program of record. IVEWS has been down selected by 2 international partners, and we are in discussions with 7 other countries. Overall, IVEWS has the potential to be a new multibillion-dollar product line for us. We're also well positioned to address emerging international opportunities for autonomous systems.
 The first of 4 Triton aircraft is expected to be delivered to Australia later this year. In addition, NATO is actively looking to expand its maritime surveillance capabilities, enabling a higher degree of interoperability amongst allied nations. We believe our Triton program is well suited to meet these requirements, providing an opportunity for up to 5 aircraft. And we see additional Triton opportunities emerging elsewhere in Europe. 
 There also continues to be an uptrend in U.S. and allied partner demand for missile products and ammunition. This includes several significant ammunition opportunities for allies that in aggregate have the potential to support further growth in our Defense Systems portfolio at solid margins. And this week, the U.S. Congress has supplemental funding bill, which includes munitions procurement and missile product capacity expansion. 
 As we shared in our prior calls, to meet growing demand across our weapon systems business, we have been investing in our largest solid rocket motor production facility over the past 5 years, and we have now tripled our production capacity for tactical SRMs. Technology leadership is an important part of our business strategy. And we've been investing to maintain our lead in microelectronics for defense applications. To further this objective, we recently established the Northrop Grumman Microelectronics Center, which brings together our microelectronic capability from across the company into one organization. It will be led by our Mission Systems business, where over 80% of their revenue is enabled by our innovation and investments in microelectronics. 
 Today, our U.S. microelectronics facilities produce over 1 million microchips a year with tailored design, fabrication and advanced packaging needed to support the most advanced defense systems and sensors. We also work with leading-edge technology developers in the commercial space, like NVIDIA to incorporate their technology into our national security solutions. In addition to advancement in capability, we are expanding our capacity in this important technology area. 
 In the quarter, we held a groundbreaking ceremony for our new advanced electronics facility in Waynesboro, Virginia. With this $200 million investment, we are increasing our ability to manufacture and test advanced electronics and mission solutions. As I mentioned earlier, we are laser-focused on performance and driving cost efficiencies in our business. This includes deploying systems and tools that help enable increased productivity across our business. 
 In the first quarter, we completed the implementation of a significant financial ERP upgrade, which consolidated multiple versions of our prior system, and it will significantly improve the efficiency of our operations. This new system provides a foundation that supports many of the other digital transformation initiatives. And it plays an integral role in our longer-term margin expansion strategy. The upgrade, as you would understand, was a massive undertaking that was achieved with minimal disruption to our business. It's really a credit to the entire team who worked tirelessly to achieve this outcome. 
 We also continue to proactively address our overhead costs and indirect rates to drive affordability for our customers. We saw benefits of this in the first quarter, particularly in production programs at both AS and DS. Efficiency in both direct and indirect cost management continues to be a priority across the company. 
 Program execution is another area of particular emphasis in 2024. In our space sector, after rapid growth over the last several years, we are keenly focused on delivering key capabilities for our customers, executing our extensive backlog and generating strong returns in the process. This includes the progress we're making on the Sentinel program. We're continuing to execute the EMD phase of the program, and we've made solid progress on design and development activities for the facilities and support equipment as well as the missile itself. 
 The Nunn-McCurdy review is continuing, and we are providing support to the Department of Defense in that process as well. It's a complex undertaking to modernize the U.S. strategic deterrent, which requires delivering the most advanced capabilities in the world to form the basis of that deterrent. We're honored to be part of this vital mission, so we're partnering with our customers in bringing the focus, resources and talent needed to deliver on those commitments.
 Finally, I'd like to provide an update on our capital deployment strategy. First and foremost, we are investing in capabilities that meet our customers' needs to address rapidly evolving threats. This year, we continue to expect that we'll invest roughly $1.8 billion in capital expenditures bringing our total investment to nearly $8 billion since the beginning of 2020. These investments have contributed to our strong growth performance and outlook. At the same time, we are efficiently returning capital to shareholders, including nearly $1.5 billion in the first quarter.
 So in summary, with a broad portfolio of well-supported programs continued new domestic and international opportunities, a relentless focus on performance and a capital deployment strategy designed to create value for customers and shareholders alike. Northrop Grumman is well positioned for the future. 
 So with that, I'd like to hand the call over to Dave, and he's going to cover some of the details of our financial performance and outlook before we take your questions. Dave? 
David Keffer: Thanks, and good morning, everyone. As Kathy highlighted, we're off to a strong start to the year. Sales, operating income and EPS all increased meaningfully from the first quarter of 2023 as we execute on our backlog and drive efficiencies in our business.
 Starting with our top line results on Slide 4 in our earnings deck. First quarter sales increased 9% to $10.1 billion. We were pleased to deliver higher Q1 sales at all 4 of our segments. These results were ahead of our initial projections for the first quarter, due in part to the timing of material volume on certain programs. With that in mind, we expect a more gradual ramp in our quarterly sales profile than in the past few years. I'll address the factors contributing to this as I walk through updates to our segment guidance. 
 As AS sales were particularly strong, up 18%, driven by higher volume on the B-21 program as well as on mature production programs like F-35. Defense Systems sales increased 3%, primarily due to growth on multiple programs in our weapons business, and as expected, were partially offset by lower volume on an international training program. 
 Mission Systems sales grew by 4%, led by rapid growth on advanced microelectronics programs in our restricted portfolio, partially offset by lower volume on SABR. And sales at space increased by 9% with broad-based growth throughout the portfolio, including on the SDA transport layer programs as they continue to ramp. 
 Turning to the bottom line. We remain laser-focused on performance. In Q1, we generated segment operating income of $1.1 billion, a year-over-year increase of 10%. Margin rate was also solid at 10.9%. As we've outlined on previous earnings calls, we expect to increase our margin rate over time as mix shifts favorably, macro conditions improve and productivity measures continue to bear fruit. Aeronautics operating income increased 25% for an operating margin rate of 10%. Efficient indirect rate performance, driven by productivity initiatives and careful cost management helped to generate a healthy volume of favorable net EAC adjustments. These adjustments were recognized across the AS portfolio but primarily benefited mature production programs. 
 On B-21, there were no significant changes to our EACs, and we continue to make good progress in the test phase of the EMD program and on the build of the LRIP production units in flow. We have finalized negotiations with additional suppliers on the LRIP phase of the program and are in the late stages of negotiations with the remaining. 
 Defense Systems operating income grew 11%. They also benefited from favorable mix and indirect rate performance, driving their OM rate to 12.5%. At Mission Systems, segment operating income increased 5% and margin rate increased 20 basis points to 14.2%. MS' OM rate benefited from favorable mix on higher-margin advanced microelectronics programs, partially offset by lower net favorable EAC adjustments. We see opportunities to further improve performance at MS, driven by operational efficiencies and investments we've made in our factories. Lastly, space operating income increased 6% and its margin rate was a solid 9.1%.
 Moving to earnings per share on Slide 6. Diluted EPS were $6.32 in Q1, an increase of 15% from the prior year. The increase was driven by our strong growth in segment performance as well as from higher net pension income and a lower share count. 
 Turning to cash flow. We're pleased with our cash performance. particularly in light of our ERP conversion that went live in the first quarter. This was a significant undertaking that will help to drive additional efficiencies in our business over time. 
 Q1 free cash flow was an outflow of approximately $1 billion, and we expect a strong quarter of cash generation in Q2. This profile is consistent with our seasonal pattern of generating the majority of our free cash flow in the second half of the year. 
 Moving to guidance. We are reaffirming our 2024 company level guidance and have a few updates at the segment level. We continue to project a book-to-bill ratio close to 1x for the year. Note, we expect a higher ratio at AS, DS and MS and a lower ratio at space, given all the backlog growth that has generated in recent years and flattening U.S. space budgets. At the company level, we expect our second quarter sales and segment margin volume to be roughly in line with the strong Q1 results with modest expansion in the second half. We expect the quarterly profile to vary at the segment level, so I'll take a moment to provide some additional color. 
 First, DS and MS sales and margin dollars are expected to ramp throughout the year, generally consistent with prior year patterns. Restricted programs in MS continue to expand, and the DS Weapons business has significant demand that Kathy described, which should lead to further second half growth. 
 Our margin rate guidance was adjusted slightly higher at DS and slightly lower at MS, reflecting our Q1 performance and latest expectations for the remainder of the year. At aeronautics, we are increasing our sales guidance to the mid-$11 billion to reflect our strong Q1 results and our latest projections for B-21 sales timing. But the quarterly sales profile is projected to be different this year than it was in 2023. The timing of materials volume, primarily on F-35 and B-21, drove additional Q1 sales. So we'd expect a flatter profile through the remaining quarters. As our full year guidance indicates, AS margin rates are expected to be lower in subsequent quarters based on business mix and the strength of Q1 EAC adjustments. For the full year, we continue to expect margins in the mid-9% range. 
 And at Space, we're lowering our sales guidance to the low to mid $14 billion, which roughly reflects 3% annual growth. Sales volume is now expected to trend lower over the remaining quarters of 2024, reflecting the NGI decision and the contract termination and restricted space that we noted last quarter. This is expected to be partially offset by continued growth in Sentinel and the SDA portfolio. Below the segment line, we are reaffirming our company-level guidance reflecting the strength of our broad portfolio. We continue to expect corporate unallocated costs to be weighted toward the second half of the year, consistent with prior years. 
 Interest expense will also be higher in future quarters due to the additional debt issuance in Q1, and we continue to project an effective tax rate around 17%. As we've noted before, we're monitoring any changes in tax legislation and any updates in our tax appeals processes, that by their nature, are not factored into our guidance. 
 And as a reminder, we completed a $2.5 billion debt offering at attractive rates shortly after the filing of our 10-K. The proceeds will be used in part to retire $1.5 billion of notes that are maturing in January 2025, as well as for general corporate purposes, including share repurchases. We initiated a $1 billion accelerated share repurchase in Q1, which is now nearly complete. In total, including our open market purchases, our Q1 repurchases were $1.2 billion. For the full year, we have increased our expectations for share repurchases to greater than $2 billion. 
 We also remain committed to providing a strong and growing dividend. Our capital deployment plans are enabled by our ability to generate strong and predictable cash flows in our diverse and durable portfolio. We continue to project industry-leading investments in our business to support our customers while returning excess cash to shareholders. We're confident that this business strategy will create value for all our stakeholders. 
 In summary, we're off to a great start to the year, and we remain upbeat about our long-term outlook. 
 And with that, let's open the call for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions]
 Our first question comes from Ron Epstein with Bank of America. 
Ronald Epstein: Kathy, if you could speak to just maybe a little more detail in that $95 billion supplemental, what potentially is in there for Northrop given everything you guys have been doing in those related businesses. 
Kathy Warden: Yes. Well, as I noted, we are pleased that the supplemental did pass this week. And as we are looking through it. There are a number of areas that align to our program portfolio. Some where we are prime in weapons programs, others where we are a supplier of solid rocket motors. And then there is a line for additional capacity expansion. I talked about the capacity expansion that we have done for solid rocket motors in our largest production facility that over the last several years has enabled us to triple capacity, there is additional funding that would take that capacity even higher and reflects what's needed to support those programs that are funded in the supplemental. 
 So we are bullish on the opportunity to fulfill that demand through both the investments we've made and the additional capacity that we can lay in over these coming months and years. 
Ronald Epstein: And maybe just a quick follow-on, if I may. With the push out to F/A-XX, I mean how does that have -- like what strategic impact does that have on the Aeronautics business? 
Kathy Warden: There are a number of opportunities in aeronautics that we are pursuing that being one of them. It doesn't really have an impact on our near-term outlook for that business. As we shared today, we're raising the sales guidance for that business this year, and that's really on the strength of the current portfolio and the growth that we continue to see there, but we will continue to pursue additive opportunities that maybe program being one of them. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Doug Harned with Bernstein. 
Douglas Harned: You talked a little bit about outlook for book-to-bill this year and backlog was down in each segment in Q1. I understand some of the space issues. But on AS, DS and MS, if you're looking at a book-to-bill of above 1 for the year, can you talk about where that's likely to come from? What will drive those business units since that the backlog was down in Q1? 
Kathy Warden: Yes. Doug, as we've talked about before, awards can be very lumpy, and so we tend to look at our book-to-bill over a longer stretch of time. And our last 2 years have been well over 1, so we expected this first quarter to be lighter and we had signaled that. As we look at the full year, we still believe that we'll be near 1. And it's largely going to be driven by our shorter-cycle businesses, so think Commission Systems and Defense Systems and space will clearly be the lowest as we digest the NGI loss and, of course, the cancellation that we had in the first quarter. But I'll remind you, our space business has nearly doubled over the last 4 years, and the book-to-bill there has been incredibly strong. So they're still carrying a large backlog of business that supports the growth rates that we're projecting for them. 
Douglas Harned: Well, and then just on space, you mentioned the importance of Sentinel and you've talked over the last quarter about some of the Nunn-McCurdy breach and those issues. But when you look at the Air Force moving the IOC schedule back by 2 years, how does that affect your growth path on Sentinel? 
Kathy Warden: We had talked about Sentinel growth coming flattening out for a few years and then returning to growth as we moved into the production phase later in the decade that still holds true. That timing has, of course, moved as the program schedule is moving, but the profile still is quite similar to what we have been discussing. And it was so far out in the future, it really wasn't in any of the projections that we had in '24 or even '25. It was well beyond that. Still a healthy ramp is expected for that program, and we are laser-focused on delivering and meeting the schedule commitments that we are working towards with the Air Force. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. 
Kristine Liwag: The Air Force lowered its near-term requested funding levels for B-21 in the fiscal year '25 budget proposal. And they talked about lower negotiated prices on low rate production. How does this change alter the economics of the program and risks of incremental charges? 
Kathy Warden: It doesn't change the economics of the program. What happened is the budget was set based on the independent cost estimates. And as we move towards the contract phase where LRIP was exercised the first option, the government is now reconciling to our contract value. There was no change in price schedule quantities. It's just a reflection of them moving off of an independent cost estimate and moving to our contract value, which, of course, was lower than their independent cost estimates. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. 
Sheila  Kahyaoglu: Kathy, I wanted to ask about DS. Maybe can you talk about the puts and takes there just given supply chain as well as services and incremental opportunities such as IBCS and Missile Systems. How do you think about the trajectory just given some of the positive movements we've seen in missiles, initial defense and obviously, supplementals and the driver of potential margin improvement there? 
Kathy Warden: Yes. So our Defense Systems portfolio has been undergoing a transformation over the past several years. As you know, we divested the services business, and we still have a sustainment and modernization business. That business has been flattish. And this year, we talked about a headwind in that business to growth associated with an international training program. You see that weighing a bit on first quarter growth in DS being 3%. Over time, we expect that growth rate to reflect the other 2 portions of the business more and more as that mix shifts toward weapons and our battle management portfolio. That's where IBCS sits. 
 I spoke on today's call about some of those opportunities, both domestically and internationally in the weapons and the IBCS portfolios. And so we expect those to contribute to growth, and they are also higher margin than our sustainment business. So as that mix shifts, so will margins improve. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. 
Seth Seifman: Kathy, I wanted to ask on autonomous aircraft and the CCA program, we saw last night the news about Anduril selection along with General Atomics. And I was wondering if you can -- with that news, maybe update us on Northrop's strategy to capture a new work in the autonomous space. 
Kathy Warden: Yes. So we're obviously disappointed to learn that we weren't selected on this phase of the CCA program. The -- as Air Force has described this acquisition strategy as a continuous competition and they're already outlining future phases. So we'll see what that presents in terms of future entry point. We also see the other services in the U.S., and I talked about international partners as well, continuing to look to add to their autonomous vehicle fleet. And so we are pursuing those opportunities. 
 We haven't learned anything at this point that fundamentally changes our strategy in autonomy, but we'll monitor how the CCA program progresses and will incorporate any learnings that we have into those future opportunities. And for us, you didn't ask, but this phase of the program was relatively small. We didn't have it assumed in our plan. So there's no impact to the guidance that we shared this morning for the AS sector. 
Seth Seifman: Okay. Okay. Great. And then maybe a follow-up on it. When you think about where you want to be focused in autonomy. I guess the legacy of the company is more on the exquisite side, and there will probably be some demand for that, but also demand for quantity and -- which requires affordability. Do you plan to pursue opportunities in both of those submarkets or really focus more on that kind of legacy exquisite piece of the market? 
Kathy Warden: We are obviously working toward affordability in our product line, so we do not want to be viewed as only offering exquisite and expensive technology. So we've been working to drive down the cost of our offerings, and I think we had quite a compelling offering on CCA and can compete in that marketplace. We are really positioned to provide the best solutions that our customer needs against a high-end threat, however, we are not looking to compete in a more commoditized part of the market that's very low cost and not survivable systems. That's just not our business model, and we know that. So we'll remain disciplined in where we invest in the pieces of the market that we pursue, but we think that what we provide is still highly relevant. 
Operator: Our next question comes from David Strauss with Barclays. 
David Strauss: Kathy, I wanted to ask about MS margins. A couple of years ago, we were running in the 15 level, they stepped down a little bit last year. You took down a margin guide there. Can you just kind of talk about what's driving the lower margins? Is it just solely mix that's driving the lower margin in that MS? 
Kathy Warden: It's a bit of mix as we've been talking about. They have a higher cost plus mix now than they have historically, and we expect that to shift over time, but they are still at a high watermark. And there also is a productivity element to the story. We've talked about supply chain disruption as we have ramped and we are also increasing the scale of that business. You see a mid-single-digit level growth in Mission Systems. But with price coming down on microelectronics, it's actually a much higher volume ramp than is reflected in the total sales growth of the business. 
 So as we have climbed that ramp, productivity has taken a bit of a dip. But as we said, we're focused on getting back to our prior performance levels at now this higher volume level, and we see that as something this team is very capable of doing. And that's why you see a margin profile that always is start a little slower and ramp through the year for MS, but you'll see it again reflected this year based on those productivity improvements that we expect to achieve throughout the year. 
David Strauss: Okay. Got it. And then similar question over on the Space side. So you took down the top line there, I assume that was partially NGI. The slower growth, should we see that potentially reflect itself in a little bit better margin profile? I know you got the margin guidance unchanged at 9, but I guess the NGI loss and just a little bit slower growth, could that actually help the -- help enhance the margin side of things. 
Kathy Warden: Yes. As we look at the slower growth, it is largely development programs that are dilutive to the both space margin rate and the company margin rate. So as -- that part of the business is no longer as significant. You will see that be both margin and cash tailwinds because there was also CapEx investments planned that we will not extend in those programs now either. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with TD Cowen. 
Cai Von Rumohr: Good performance, Kathy. So following up on Dave's focus on space, I think I've got 2 questions. First, the restricted program that was canceled, is there any chance that we heard a rumor it might have been related to a supplier issue. Is there any chance that, that function or that program might reappear again in the future? 
 And secondly, the SDA business, you basically decided not to bid 1 contract. Is that as a group, are those profitable contracts? Because every time I look, there's another new small supplier coming in and they're all fixed price contract. 
Kathy Warden: So let me start with your first question on the restricted program. There's very little I can say, given the nature of that program, except to say that the Air Force canceled that program largely due to budgetary concerns and prioritization, but the requirement likely does still exist. And so we will see how that plays out over time. I also -- as we look at the broader space portfolio, we'll answer your SDA question more generally. We see a whole variety of opportunities that we can pursue, so we're simply selective on which ones we're best positioned to win, where we think that we can competitively. 
 And with SDA, we've been quite successful and those programs are profitable. But that's because we're remaining disciplined in choosing where we can best compete and win with a reasonable fee and the probability of success. 
Cai Von Rumohr: But you did know bid that one program. As we move forward, is the pricing here getting a little bit more competitive as more people join the party? 
Kathy Warden: The way I think about bid strategies is if there is an area where you have a differentiated value, then you are going to be able to price accordingly. If you don't, you won't. And so we don't bid when we don't feel like we have a differentiated value that's going to be successful with the price we need to bid to both win and execute. It's really a decision we make on every capture. It's fundamental to the way we both commit and execute as well as deliver the returns that we expect. So no change there and no difference in the states than it is in other parts of our portfolio. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. 
Robert Stallard: Kathy, I just wanted to follow up on your comments at the start of the call where you talked about the FY '25 request and DoD spending leveling off. I was wondering who you think could be the bill payers in that budget scenario or whether there's any vulnerability in the Northrop Grumman portfolio? 
Kathy Warden: We looked at the FY '25 president's budget is very much in line with our expectations. So no surprises and no concerns about our portfolio. Obviously, we talked about two things where budget was a factor in DA choosing to down select early on NGI was largely due to budgetary constraints. And then, of course, the restricted space program that we mentioned, but those we have now digested and, of course, reflected not only in our outlook, but my comments about the FY '25 budget. .
 So nothing else that we see in there that is concerning. And as I noted, '24 ended up being a strong year for the investment accounts with 6% growth over '23. And we also have the supplemental on top of that. So it's early in looking at '25 and where the budget environment will actually end up in the U.S. But I also just keep pointing back to international demand, that's the strongest that I've seen in a long time. And so we look at global demand, not just the U.S. marketplace. 
Robert Stallard: Which is -- I've got a quick follow-on on that actually because you did mention exports as well. And I was wondering if you could give us an update on what sort of scale as a percentage of revenues, exports are at the moment and what that could grow to in the future. 
Kathy Warden: They're about 14% right now. And while we don't see that moving significantly in the near term because there's opportunities I noted in the pipeline do take a while to prosecute and turn into sales. We do expect that, that will be a faster segment of growth than our domestic business over the next several years, just the richness of the pipeline. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global. 
Peter Skibitski: Kathy, can you talk about Northrop's roll in the shipbuilding supply chain, which I guess is the marine unit in MS. Just because the Navy has talked about some of the supply chain challenges in shipbuilding. Maybe you could just kind of swage any concerns maybe in terms of how that unit is performing and the growth outlook there? And just kind of how you guys are managing that unit to just so we have a good feel that smoke doesn't turn into fire kind of scenarios? 
Kathy Warden: Absolutely. It's a critically important part of our portfolio. We're very focused on delivering for our customers in that portfolio. And there have been challenges that we own. We've been working on a development program for nearly 10 years. It's going to deliver an amazing step function improvement in propulsion for the Columbia class submarines. And we are near delivering those first care of turbine generators. And that's what the Secretary of the Navy was referring to in his testimony on the Hill. 
 We are working to address supply chain challenges, as you have heard across the entire shipbuilding enterprise, our experience is very consistent with that. These programs are long cycle. And so we only go through these development efforts once over a multi-decade period and there's learning that happens. But in this case, I think we are largely through that learning and on a path for delivery, and we're optimistic of the future ahead in being able to deliver this capability.
 From a financial perspective that you asked about, this is relatively small, so not something that you should think of as having a material financial impact, but that doesn't mean we don't take it very seriously. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Deuschle with Deutsche Bank. 
Scott Deuschle: Dave, just to clarify, what's the message on space growth beyond this year? Does it reaccelerate off this 4% or so this year? 
David Keffer: Yes, I appreciate the question. As you know, we'll provide more specific guidance for all of our businesses and at the enterprise level later this year and provide some indications on the October call as is our traditional approach. I think the broader themes that we've talked about in space today are important. We've touched on the restricted program cancellation in the NGI down select news. But broadly speaking, the doubling of that business's backlog over the last 5 years, the 17% CAGR in sales over that business in the last 4 years, both position us really well for continued success in that business. 
 And there is margin rate and margin dollar expansion opportunity on top of that. So we'll provide more specifics as we go about the combination of headwinds from the items we mentioned and tailwinds from the continued growth on other programs. So more specific later in the year, but we continue to be confident in the long-term outlook of the Space business. 
Scott Deuschle: Okay. Great. And then, Kathy, you flagged opportunities for increased demand for ammunition from U.S. allies, so I was wondering if you could talk a bit more about maybe the specific ammunition products that allies you're looking to purchase from Northrop? And in which regions you're seeing that demand percolate? So I understand that there's at least one specific European supplier of ammunition that generates something like 25% operating margins off that revenue. So just curious to understand what that opportunity could mean for Northrop. 
Kathy Warden: Yes, of course. So as we look at our weapons portfolio today, it's about 6% to 7% of revenue. It's growing double digit, and we expect that to continue. A good part of that growth will be supported both by the supplemental that I spoke about in my opening comments in response to Ron's question, but also the European demand has strengthened. So we have a number of opportunities, countries across Europe looking to do the exact same thing the U.S. is doing in replenishing stockpiles for munitions. 
 And those are basic and nonstandard ammo contracts that we have. Our business grew nicely last year. We expect that to continue this year. And we also have programs like AARGM, where there's international demand, that's a longer-term proposition as we look to provide those products to our European allies, particularly as they feel the F-35. So a wide ranging set from ammunition all the way up to tactical missiles. And then, of course, our solid rocket motor facility expansion supports many of our peer programs like GMLRS, PAC-3, looking to be a second source to support and fix all of those opportunities are in the mix for us. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Myles Walton with Wolfe Research. 
Myles Walton: Kathy, you provided a ton of international color both in your opening remarks and also a follow-up to Rob's question. But when I look at the sales disclosures, it's been pretty locked in at $5 billion for 5 years of absolute dollar revenue. So is there a color you can give us on the backlog that shows that this international opportunity is at least working its way into backlog, if not sales in the coming year? 
Kathy Warden: Yes. So in terms of backlog, what you would look to see as we signed the IBCS deals that I mentioned with additional countries as we sign the contracts for Triton that I highlighted in the call today. The IVEWS that are in the early stages, the 2 countries progressing toward awards. These are all awards that would be in new franchises that we have not had in the past. While we continue to see just the standard growth in areas like F-35 international and the Triton portfolio with the Australians that are already underway or E-2D franchise with France and Japan. So those are still in the backlog and then you'd add to that, the opportunities that I highlighted this morning that are new franchises for us. 
Myles Walton: Okay. So the percent of the backlog that's international has been expanding though, I think, is what you're saying? 
Kathy Warden: It has, although really what we see now is a whole set of opportunities for product lines that were not in our backlog over the last 5 years. So that's the difference. Our portfolio has largely been high-end capabilities that aren't exportable. And as you look at how the portfolio has evolved over time, these new franchises that I spoke about today or franchises like Triton now getting permissibility for exports to more countries is really opening up a whole new set of opportunities for our company. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Gavin Parsons with UBS. 
Gavin Parsons: Kathy, you mentioned you've finalized negotiations with additional suppliers on the B-21. Were those all in line with your expectations? Can you share what percentage of suppliers are now locked in? And then when you expect that to be fully finalized? 
Kathy Warden: So they were largely in line with our expectations, which is reflected in the fact that we had no EAC change in the quarter. We are far along in negotiations with all of our suppliers, and we expect to be closing on those shortly that we're making sure that we have the best scale possible and that we work those negotiations diligently. So I've not set a time barrier to the team more so an outcome, I've set of objectives for them, and they're doing quite well against those expectations. And our suppliers are obviously key to us. We want to make sure that they are able to support the investment in this program that's necessary. And so we're taking their interest in line as well. 
Gavin Parsons: Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then, Dave, maybe just on Aeronautics margin, I think you mentioned the strength in 1Q will be a little lighter through the rest of the year. But was 1Q as expected? Was that in guide? Or did you perform better than you thought you would in the first quarter? 
David Keffer: The first quarter was particularly strong. As we mentioned, we had anticipated an opportunity for productivity gains and indirect rate-driven enhancement to the margin as well this year that was baked into our guidance. And the timing was such that a lot of that came in, in the first quarter, which is why we've noted that we expect the margin rate to be slightly lower in subsequent quarters than it was right out of the gate set at 10%. And so while there's no single onetime item in the first quarter, it was a particularly strong start and a great way to kick off the year for AS. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Matt Akers with Wells Fargo. 
Matthew Akers: I wanted to ask on Sentinel. You mentioned you're supporting the Nunn-McCurdy review. Just curious what you think the outcomes of that could be? And if there's any risk to that program or do you think that's not the case just given sort of how critical it is. 
Kathy Warden: Well, there has been strong bipartisan support for the program. We expect that will continue. It, of course, is the nation's policy as reviewed in the nuclear posture review to have 3 legs of strategic deterrence. So we do expect that the program will be recertified, but the government needs to take the process seriously. It's a good process. And they're working through the phases of that recertification now. And as I said, we're providing support to them and stay committed and very focused on delivering the program in the meantime, not getting distracted by the activity associated with the Nunn-McCurdy but supporting it fully. 
Matthew Akers: Yes. Got it. And I guess one for Dave. Just thoughts on where EACs at the company level kind of go from here, you're still running quite a bit below where you were a couple of years ago, it sounds like AS had some good EACs, but just thoughts on the progress from here. 
David Keffer: Sure. I agree with your characterization that there was good progress in the first quarter. And you'll see that further detailed in our 10-Q disclosures as well. We had been running substantially above the levels of 2022 and 2023 in prior years before the macroeconomic disruptions. And so over time, we anticipate that we will normalize to levels more like our history and we saw progress towards that in the first quarter, as you mentioned, particularly in AS. 
 But really across the business, you're seeing the results of our heavy focus on program performance and cost efficiency. It's 1 of the 3 drivers that we anticipate for margin expansion, along with business mix enhancement, and the gradual decline of macroeconomic pressures. And so across those 3 dimensions, we see an opportunity to continue to see margins normalize over the next several years, and Q1 was a good example of what you can anticipate there. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Jason Gursky with Citi. 
Jason Gursky: Kathy, I was wondering if I could ask you to dive a little deep on the space business in 2 areas, maybe starting with sensors and payloads. And talk a little bit about the pipeline of business opportunity that you have there, where you're seeing the most interest kind of -- like type of sensor, letter optical communications, SAAR, RF, that kind of thing. Just talk a little bit about the general kind of ecosystem and what's going on in the sensors and payload business that you've got there and what you're kind of excited about today? 
Kathy Warden: So we are seeing interest in modernizing really the entire architecture and space. And I've been talking about this for a while, so whether it's intelligence surveillance reconnaissance, communications, missile warning and tracking, the entire space architecture is being upgraded, both in terms of advancing the capability of those sensors and payloads but also the coverage with the broadening of the space architecture. And so we're involved selectively in all of those areas. As you know, we play a key role in ISR communications, and very informed of both missile tracking and missile warning. 
 So really, we feel we have a very broad portfolio that stretches across those areas we don't focus in on one over the other, and we see them all equally attractive. And really, in many ways, that modernization is well underway and is what has contributed to the strong growth of our backlog and space over the last few years. 
Jason Gursky: Okay. And maybe a similar kind of discussion on the ground systems side of things and whether that's all the sensor and payloads that we're launching up in the space are driving the ground system business, just kind of what the competitive environment looks like for you there? 
Kathy Warden: Yes. They are, and we do participate in the ground segment. I'd say our strength is more in the sensors and payloads but we look at a full integrated solution and often are asked by the government to support them on the ground systems development that go with the satellites that we're fielding. And so we see that as a marketplace where we absolutely can compete. We just choose to be a bit more selective there, again, back to where we're more differentiated. 
Todd Ernst: Josh, have time for one more question. 
Operator: And our last question comes from Peter Arment with Baird. 
Peter Arment: Nice results. Kathy, can you maybe just talk a little bit about what you expect on your CapEx kind of profile. When we think about last year, you had a big step up and things are staying elevated here, but you also have just tremendous demand signals, both domestically and internationally. Just how you're thinking about how CapEx should trend? Have you made enough of the investment. It sounds like you have on the solid rocket side and microelectronics, but just thinking about more broadly? 
Kathy Warden: Yes. Some part of why we highlighted today some of those investments that we're making that will support growth over the long term is to reflect the statements that we've made that we do see this year being the peak 4% of revenue CapEx expenditures and then starting to see those come down gradually more towards a normalized level in our company, still see those as a robust growth environment. And so there will be investments that we're making. We're committed to do that. But we do not see the same demand for those investments over the next several years that we've seen over the last several.
 Good well, thank you all for joining us on the call today. We -- as you see, we're off to a strong start to the year, and we will carry that momentum into the following quarters as our team focuses relentlessly on delivering that technology advantage for our customers and value to our shareholders. So thanks again for joining us. I look forward to speaking with you on our next call in July. 
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-01-25 11:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to Northrop Grumman's Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2023 Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. My name is Josh, and I will be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Todd Ernst, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Ernst, please proceed.
Todd Ernst: Thanks, Josh. Good morning and welcome to Northrop Grumman's Fourth Quarter 2023 Conference Call. This morning, we'll refer to a presentation that is posted to our IR website. Before we get started, matters discussed on today's call, including guidance and outlooks for 2024 and beyond reflect the company's judgment based on information available at the time of this call. They constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to safe harbor provisions of federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, including those noted in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties may cause actual company results to differ materially. Today's call will include non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to our GAAP results in our earnings release. And on the call today are Kathy Warden, our Chair, CEO and President; and Dave Keffer, our CFO. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kathy. Kathy?
Kathy Warden: Thanks Todd. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. Before discussing our 2023 results, I wanted to take a moment to thank our team for their hard work and dedication to our important mission. Our talented workforce which is now over a 100,000 strong continues to deliver some of the most advanced technologies in the world. These capabilities are used by our customer’s everyday to defend freedom and deter aggression around the globe. The geopolitical landscape has grown even more complex driving continued increases in global security spending. Our strategies has positioned us well to compete and win in this growing market which has translated into accelerating topline growth for Northrop Grumman. Revenue increased by over 7% in 2023 [indiscernible] more than a billion above the midpoint of our original 2023 guidance. In addition, our book-to-bill for the year was 1.14 times, that’s in line with our exceptional four year average. As a result of this award strength, we achieved a new record backlog which now exceeds $84 billion and now provides a healthy foundation for our continued growth. The underlying performance of our company is strong. We generated free cash flow at the high end of our guidance range, and we comfortably exceeded our sales and EPS guidance range, absence of B-21 charge. While we're disappointed that our assessment of conditions for the low rate initial production portion of the B-21 program necessitated this charge in the quarter, we are confident in our ability to deliver on the company's forward outlook, which remains unchanged. We're also proud of the performance of the B-21 team, which continues to execute an unparalleled aircraft development program. As we look forward, we will continue to execute our business strategy, which at its core is based on technology differentiation, a laser focus on performance, and value delivery for our customers and shareholders. To support this strategy, we are prioritizing investment in our capacity and capabilities. In 2023, we invested over $2.9 billion in R&D and CapEx, that's 7.5% of sales, to continue driving innovation and capacity to support our customer mission success. We also delivered over $2.6 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, representing a return of approximately 125% of our 2023 free cash flow. So now I'll highlight a few examples of progress we've made across the portfolio that further bolster my confidence in our future. Shortly after the close of the fourth quarter, we announced our GEM 63XL solid rocket boosters helped to successfully power ULA’s Vulcan launch vehicle on its first mission. Future Vulcan missions will utilize additional GEM 63XLs in support of Amazon, Kuiper, and other ULA customers, providing a significant growth opportunity for our propulsion business. And this is an important milestone because it supports our investment to significantly ramp production capacity of GEM 63s in the coming years. Global demand for our weapons system increased in 2023, and we expect this trend to continue. In this market, we're both a supplier and a prime. We're a supplier of propulsion systems, warheads, fuses, and cannons across a highly diversified customer base, and a prime contractor for predominantly air-to-ground missiles, including AARGM, AARGM-ER, and Stand-in Attack Weapon. Weapons systems currently represents approximately 7% of total revenue, and based on the demands we're seeing, we expect this business to grow faster than the company average for the foreseeable future, with a significant portion of this expansion coming from international customers. In our Mission Systems business, demand remains exceptionally strong, with a 2023 book-to-bill above 1.2 times, the highest of all of our segments. As we've seen in recent years, the restricted portfolio of Mission Systems is a meaningful driver of growth as our customers pursue solutions that enable them to operate inside the decision loop of potential adversaries who are also advancing their computing capabilities. We are helping our customers stay ahead by developing advanced microelectronics, sensors, processors, and secure communication. Our product lines are enabling faster cycles of modernization, positioning our customers with decision advantage in this rapidly advancing technology environment. And we continue to make significant progress on the EMD phase of Sentinel, which is the next generation land-based leg of the strategic triad. We are achieving milestones to mature the design and reduce risk, including key test activities, such as the successful static fire test of the Sentinel Stage 2 solid rocket motor for the missile earlier this month. Last week, the Air Force submitted to Congress a new set of cost estimates for the program, which triggered a Nunn-McCurdy Breach. This in turn launches a review of the program by the Department of Defense, which we expect to be ongoing for the next several months. It's important to note that the cost growth is primarily driven by estimates for the command and launch facility build-out, which is part of the military construction and procurement phases of the program. We and our industry team are continuing to perform on the EMD phase in close partnership with the U.S. Air Force. And we'll work with the government to explore opportunities to reduce costs on the program with a focus on the late 2020s and beyond when the program is expected to move into the procurement phase. And in the fourth quarter, the B-21 entered its flight test phase. This is a major milestone for the program and achieving it within the baseline schedule is a credit to the Northrop Grumman team and our close partnership with the U.S. Air Force over the past several years. Following this milestone, we were awarded the first LRIP lot in the fourth quarter and production is now underway. Let me take a few moments to provide a little more detail on the B-21 charge. The possibility of which we started talking with you about at this time last year. As you know, like all of industry, we and our suppliers have experienced cost pressure from recent global macroeconomic conditions, which are significantly different from the assumptions the team made when bidding these five production lots in 2015. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we again reviewed our estimated profitability on the LRIP phase of the program. And we now believe it is probable each of the first five LRIP lots will be performed at a loss. The charge is largely driven by a change in our assumptions regarding funding to mitigate the impact of macroeconomic disruptions on the LRIP phase of the program and higher projected manufacturing costs that reflect recent supplier negotiations and our experience in completing the first aircraft. The after tax cash impact related to these updates will be spread over a number of years. Importantly, we have absorbed this effect and we have not changed our outlook for free cash flow growth over the next several years. This is a game changing capability that will be of great value to our nation. And we are focused on executing the program in a way that also delivers value to our shareholders over the coming decades. Turning now to the budget environment. Global national security spending is increasing as the U.S. and allies invest in capabilities to deter and defend against aggression. Demand for our capabilities remain strong due to our differentiated portfolio and alignment to customer priorities including the triad, space and weapons. In the U.S., our franchise programs remain well supported by Congress and the Department of Defense. And this gives us confidence in our outlook even in a constrained U.S. budget environment. We are pleased to have an NDAA in place that provides continued support for defense spending. And we're hopeful that Congress will enact appropriations soon. Our guidance assumes we will not have a shutdown or a full year CR, and we're encouraged by the progress we've seen so far towards passing appropriations in the March timeframe. Additionally, we are monitoring progress on supplemental funding and we see opportunities in expanding the industrial base and increasing munitions production in this pending request. Our allies are also increasing their defense spending and we expect our alignment with their needs for aircraft, weapon systems and mission systems to be an additional source of growth. So as we look to the future, we have the right portfolio and team to deliver on our long-term outlook. Our organic sales have grown at a greater than 5% annual rate since 2019. And our guidance calls for continued growth of 4% to 5% in 2024. Segment operating margin dollars are expected to grow at roughly the same rate as sales in 2024. And our 2024 EPS guidance range of $24.45 to $24.85 at the midpoint represents roughly 6% growth excluding the B-21 charge and 11% growth compared to our initial EPS estimates which we provided for in 2023. In addition, the structural building blocks to expand our margins that we outlined in last year's 2Q earnings call, including dissipating macroeconomic headwinds, implementation of productivity and cost savings initiatives and future favorable mix shift remain in place. We are laser focused on performance and bid discipline to drive margin expansion. And importantly, we continue to expect our free cash flow to grow at a double digit rate over the coming years. We are reaffirming our 2024 and 2025 free cash flow outlook. And we've also introduced a 2026 outlook of $3.3 billion at the midpoint. With the businesses generating significant cash flow, we have considerable flexibility in deploying capital to generate value for customers and shareholders. Our top priority remains investing to support our business strategy. And we expect to invest over 7% of sales again in 2024 in capital expenditures and R&D. At the same time, we'll continue to provide strong capital returns to our shareholders. Last month, our board of directors increased our share repurchase authorization by an additional $2.5 billion, and we ended the year with a remaining authorization of $3.6 billion. For 2024, we expect to increase our share repurchases to at least $2 billion. This includes a $1 billion ASR that we plan to initiate in the coming days based on the strong liquidity position with which we entered this year. So when we take these factors, sustainable top-line growth with expanding margins, and couple those with declining capital intensity and lower projected cash taxes, you get a recipe for robust cash flow growth for years to come. So now I'll turn it over to Dave to provide you more details on the segment results, 2024 guidance, and the forward outlook. Dave?
Dave Keffer: Thanks, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. We finished the year with strong momentum, enabling us to reaffirm and build upon our favorable forward outlook. I'll start by elaborating on our 2023 results and then provide additional details on our guidance. On the demand side, we ended 2023 with over $84 billion in backlog, a new record for our company. All four of our segments generated a full-year book-to-bill ratio over one-time sales. We also continued to deliver strong top-line results with Q4 sales of $10.6 billion, up 6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Full-year sales were even stronger, up over 7% at $39.3 billion, or roughly $300 million higher than our latest guidance. These top-line results were enabled not only by the strong demand environment we're seeing among our customers, but also by our ability to ramp on new programs, expand our workforce, and convert our backlog into sales. Moving to segment results, we generated sales growth in each of our businesses in 2023. Aeronautics sales were up 2% for the year, returning to growth earlier than previously expected. AS growth was driven by higher volume on restricted programs that more than offset declines on mature production programs. DS posted sales growth of 5%, led by higher volume in the weapons and missile defense portfolio. Mission System sales were also up 5%, driven by higher restricted sales on advanced microelectronics programs and higher volume on marine systems programs. And our space business posted another quarter of double-digit top-line growth, with sales up approximately 14% for the year. Nearly 40% of the growth came from Sentinel and NGI, with the rest coming from our broad space portfolio. As Kathy described, our segment margins included a charge for the B-21 program. The charge was primarily driven by the confluence of lower assumptions around macroeconomic disruption funding and higher production cost projections. While the full pre-tax charge had the effect of lowering our segment margins, only $143 million has been recorded as an EAC adjustment, including a $43 million reduction to Q4 sales. The remaining was booked as a contingent liability because the majority of the lots have yet to be awarded. The charge also led to an $82 million benefit in corporate unallocated expense, stemming from a reduction in deferred state taxes. Continuing with our results, slide 5 shows a comparison of our 2023 earnings per share to the guidance we provided in October. Diluted EPS includes a $2.08 unfavorable mark-to-market adjustment from our pension plans and a $7.68 per share impact from the B-21 charge. Absent these items, we would have exceeded the high end of our prior EPS guidance range by over $0.40. Our 2023 mark-to-market adjusted EPS also included significantly less pension income compared to 2022. In total, net pension costs generated a $4.07 per share headwind in 2023. Next, I'll take a few moments to discuss our cash flows. As is our historical pattern, we had an outstanding quarter of cash performance in Q4, generating $1.6 billion in free cash flow. For the full year, our operating cash flow was $3.9 billion, and our free cash flow was $2.1 billion. This result was near the high end of our guidance range and represented free cash flow growth of 30% compared to 2022. Turning to pension results, we generated strong asset returns of roughly 11% in 2023, ahead of our long-term assumptions. The FAS discount rate declined by roughly 40 basis points to 5.15%. Netted together, along with updated census data, this generated a mark-to-market pension expense of $422 million in our GAAP results. Slide 7 in our earnings deck summarizes our pension estimates for the next three years. We continue to expect CAS recoveries to increase from current levels, providing a benefit to our cash flows, but slightly less than prior projections. And we expect a higher level of non-operating FAS pension income in the coming years, driven by our strong asset returns in 2023. In total, our funded status remains superb at nearly 100%, and we continue to project minimal cash pension contributions over the next several years. Turning to 2024, slide 9 in our earnings deck includes our segment-level guidance. Building off the strong top-line results in Q4, we now expect aeronautics sales in the low 11 billions, driven by growth on B-21 and on other programs such as F-35 and E-2D. This is higher than our prior sales estimates for AS, which reflected a flat 2023 and modest growth in 2024. Higher B-21 sales also result in a slightly lower margin rate expectation for AS, which we now project in the mid-9%, netting out to a similar volume of margin dollars compared to prior estimates. DS sales are expected to be roughly $6 billion, up low single digits from 2023. As we mentioned on the Q3 call, DS has really turned the corner on growth through strong demand for weapons and missile defense capabilities. We are optimistic in our ability to convert these opportunities into sustained growth in this business over time, which we expect to be partially offset by modest declines in the sustainment and training portions of the business. Margins are projected to remain strong at DS in the low 12% range. Mission System sales are expected in the low to mid $11 billion range for another year of mid-single digit growth, with margins of roughly 15%. And that space, after expanding sales at a greater than 17% CAGR since 2019, growth is expected to moderate in 2024 with higher segment margins. Space sales are now expected in the mid-to-high $14 billion range, with margins of approximately 9%. The mid-single digit growth rate in space reflects declines in a restricted program due to shifts in government priority, which are more than offset by growth in other parts of the space portfolio. Having built a tremendous backlog in recent years, space now has an opportunity to deliver strong ROI through more measured growth, along with margin expansion and cash generation. At the company level, our guidance reflects growth in sales and segment margin between 4% 5%, absent the B-21 charge, consistent with the outlook we provided on our October call, even after delivering top line upside in Q4. We expect another solid year of bookings, with a book-to-bill around one times. And similar to our cadence over the last few years, we expect sales to ramp throughout the year, with first quarter sales a little less than 24% of our full year estimate. We plan to be in the market soon for new debt issuance to take advantage of the favorable rate environment. The proceeds from the debt issuance will also be used in part to support refinancings of $1.5 billion of notes that are coming due in January of 2025, as well as for general corporate purposes and share repurchases, including the $1 billion ASR we intend to initiate in the coming days. We've reflected this debt issuance in our interest expense guidance, and we'd also expect interest income to contribute to the EPS line, as it did in 2023. We project an effective tax rate of approximately 17% in 2024, consistent with the range we've experienced over the last few years, excluding the mark-to-market adjustment and other unique items. We're coming closer to conclusions on a number of open audit and appeals processes with the IRS, which could have positive or negative effects on book and cash taxes as they're resolved over the next couple of years, and our forward guidance does not include any such adjustments. Similarly, we have not factored any potential changes to R&D tax legislation into our outlook. And as a reminder, our interpretation of current tax law results in a projected 5-year impact from R&D amortization of approximately $2 billion. We will continue to track these matters carefully and provide updates as they progress. In total, we expect our 2024 earnings per share to be between $24.45 and $24.85 on with approximately 148.5 million weighted shares outstanding. Moving to cash, we expect 2024 free cash flow between $2.25 billion and $2.65 billion consistent with our prior outlook. And as we've said before, capital expenditures are expected to remain elevated in 2024 before moderating in 2025 and beyond. Slide 11 in our earnings deck provides an update to our long-term free cash flow outlook to include 2026. We continue to expect our free cash flow to grow at a double-digit rate for several more years with additional growth in the second half of the decade. This expansion will be driven by sustained growth in our business, generating strong operating margin volume and converting those profits into cash. Meanwhile, lower cash taxes, higher CAS recoveries and lower levels of capital spending in the coming years provide additional structural levers to expand our cash flows at a rapid rate. Importantly, these ranges also include the latest estimated cash impacts associated with the B-21 charge. We expect roughly 60% of the charge to affect cash flows through 2026 with the remainder in the following years. Longer-term, we are confident we'll be able to continue to absorb the cash headwinds from B-21 while delivering excellent free cash flows in 2027 and beyond. In closing, I want to thank the entire Northrop Grumman team for their contributions to another great year. The strength of our portfolio and visibility of franchise programs provides us the opportunity to deliver and deploy robust cash flows as we execute on our strategy. And with that, let's open up the call to Q&A.
Operator: Thank you.[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.
Kristine Liwag: Hey good morning, Kathy and Dave.
Kathy Warden: Good morning.
Kristine Liwag: Kathy, on the B-21, you've been very clear about the pressures on this program. Ultimately, how much relief did the customer extend to you to offset macro pressures and elevate [ph] portion. And is there still a possibility of future relief?
Kathy Warden: So Kristine, we've been working with the customer. And as we noted, the conversations continue. And last year, in 2023, we and Air Force disclosed that about $60 million of $1.5 billion that Congress appropriated for inflation was allocated to the advanced procurement for Lot 1 on this program. But we have yet to work through what that relief may be in future lots. We have, of course, as we said, updated our assumptions -- and through conversation and the tight budget environment, we've actually lowered the expectations for inflation relief. And so at this point, our focus is on executing this program and finding opportunities in the performance on the program while we continue to work with the government to see if there is any inflation relief opportunity.
Kristine Liwag: Great, thank you. And I’ll keep it to one today. Thank you.
Kathy Warden: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Richard Safran with Seaport Global. You may proceed.
Richard Safran: Kathy, Dave good morning. So I know you're going to get a lot of questions on the B-21, but I thought I'd ask you about to expand on your opening remarks about Sentinel. I thought you might talk a bit more about the actions you're taking at the program back on track. How are you seeing risk on the program right now? And I guess, importantly, what you think the government's level support for the program is given all the headlines and what we've been seeing?
Kathy Warden: Yes. Thanks, Rich. So as the land-based leg of the nuclear triad, Sentinel is a top priority for the Department of Defense. The requirement for the program has been validated numerous times by multiple administrations, and we expect that to be the outcome of this latest review. As the Air Force is reported, the non-operating cost reach on the program is largely due to cost growth in the military construction and procurement segments of the program, and we and the industry team are currently executing on the cost plus EMD phase of the program. That's important because our design work in this phase is helping the Air Force to better estimate the costs of those later phases and due to a number of factors of learning their cost estimates for these later phases have increased, and that's what's driving the non-[indiscernible] breach as the Air Force has said, growth on the EMD would not have triggered the breach. I'll also note that their update captures the inflation since 2020, the last time they did a cost estimate. And we all know that there's been significantly higher inflation than what was assumed at that time. So some of that is what you're also seeing reflected in these latest cost estimates. I mean with that said, though, you asked about our performance on the program, and I'm really pleased to report on the progress that our team has made over the last 3 years while we've been executing on the EMD phase. We've on boarded thousands of engineers. We've matured the system design. We've produced and tested critical hardware in the missile system, as I've outlined earlier on the call. We've also engaged in risk reduction, which is helping to inform the Air Force launch facility modernization and we've done all this while also doing detailed planning for the future phase of the program. I myself have visited the missile fields actually, I was at one last Friday, which is part of why I've got this cold, I brought back. And I met with the Airmen [ph], who have committed themselves to this important mission. So we're all in. We know how important this is our team is partnering closely with the Air Force, and we're going to help them to deliver this essential capability for our nation.
Richard Safran: Thanks for that. Feel better.
Kathy Warden: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Ron Epstein with Bank of America. You may proceed.
Ronald Epstein: Hey good morning everyone. So maybe just jumping back to B-21. Charges like there's some programs have a tendency to accumulate over time. They don't tend to go the other way. How should we think about it as we go forward? I mean, this is what for the first 5 LRIPs, how many LRIPs could there be? And how do we think about the bounds on this? And then maybe one last thing. Is the program NPV positive and if it is, when does it actually become NPV positive, cash flow positive and so on and so forth. If you could just peel back the onion on the program.
David Keffer: Sure. I can go ahead and get started with that. And see if we can address a number of questions you raised. First of all, in terms of the future, we'll continue to update our projections every quarter as we do with all of our large programs. But it's important to note, we have a lot more information today than we did at this time last year, having completed the production in the ground test phase of the first aircraft. We also have the majority of the suppliers now under contract with the remaining in advanced stages of negotiations. We have our latest estimates for productivity and reasonable learning curves that we believe are appropriate based on our historical experience. Of course, we now have one lot under contract, and we'll finalize quantities of the next four lots over time as well. In the economy and inflationary factors have stabilized a bit over the past year, and we'll continue to track those, of course, over time as well. But perhaps most importantly, we're still performing well on this program, which is continuing to provide a critical capability for our customers. In terms of the long-term NPV, we think that's the most important thing is that our customers will get great value from the aircraft. We'll deliver them over time, and that should, over time, also lead to value for the company and our shareholders.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Douglas Harned with Bernstein. You may proceed.
Douglas Harned: Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to go back to the Sentinel program. And when -- what you've described is that I think because that EMD is going well. But when you look at where this is headed and what came out with the Air Force commentary on the Nunn-McCurdy breach. A couple of things that I wanted to understand better. They're talking about potentially a 2-year delay in IOC, they're also -- also you talked about it a little bit, but to understand how much of this breach is due to potential changes in requirements and things that are, in a sense, under your purview versus those that may be under others, including the government customer?
Kathy Warden: Yes. So as you note, there is a delay to IOC, the reason though for the Nunn-McCurdy breach is the cost growth. So oftentimes scheduled delays add costs to the program, that is not the primary contributor. It is, as you noted, design decisions, particularly related to the command and launch requirements that the Air Force has and that affects the deployment in the launch facilities in each of the silos. And so that is what we are working to inform the Air Force decision process on alternatives and ways to reduce those costs and procurement and yet those are Air Force cost estimates, and they include a significant amount of scope that is outside of the industry team's execution. But nonetheless, we will help to inform those discussions if they're ongoing during this review process.
Douglas Harned: And does the delay in the timing, does this have much effect right now on your outlook for the overall profitability of the program.
Kathy Warden: It does not, Doug, our near-term assumptions on both the ramp of the program relative to sales as well as the profitability of the program are not materially impacted.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. You may proceed.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Good morning everyone. Thank you. Kathy or Dave, maybe if you could just talk about the free cash flow guidance that you're sticking with the 15% CAGR. Just the drivers in terms of top line working capital, Section 174, and the impact of B-21, Dave, I think you said 60% of that over $600 million is through 2026. Is that right? And do we think about Sentinel as a positive cash contributor?
David Keffer: Sure. Thanks for the question, Sheila. I'm happy to dig into that. The strength of the free cash flow outlook we really think of as one of the highlights our report today. And so happy to dig into that in more detail. And I think you heard correctly that 60% of the charge is associated with the period through 2026 from a cash flow perspective. I think importantly, the strength of the broad base of other programs across the business is serving to offset those pressures. And that's what we're seeing in our ability to maintain and build confidence in our multiyear outlook including adding a strong 2026 year to that outlook that continues the double-digit growth trajectory that we expect for the next several years. We had a great finish to 2023 for free cash flow, really strong working capital performance, and that is enabling us to build confidence in our ability to continue to perform at similar levels going forward. As a company, we've put a lot of focus on working capital efficiency, on capital efficiency, on driving cash returns on recent investments and that is clearly showing up in the results and the performance of all of our sectors. We're proud of their performance on cash in Q4 and in the outlooks for 2024 and beyond. And the net effect of all of these factors is that unchanged free cash flow outlook for 2024 and 2025, along with a strong 2026. I'd highlight in terms of what drives that going forward? What's the underlying force as you point out? Certainly, the operations of the business growth in the top line is, first and foremost, with an opportunity for growth at the margin rate line as well that leads to really strong margin dollar volume, which will convert into cash through the strong working capital performance that we expect to continue which is essentially a stable assumption in our outlook. We're not looking for significant additional efficiencies given just how strong we were at the end of 2023. And then as we noted earlier, there are other structural factors that should help as well with CAS pension reimbursement growing slightly over the next few years and cash tax is projected to decline over that same period. So essentially, all of those factors will lead to strong -- strong free cash flow growth outlook for the next several years and beyond.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. You may proceed.
Seth Seifman: Thanks very much. And good morning. I guess a 2-part question about B-21. First was the $143 million EAC in the quarter, is that the extent of the entire anticipated loss on lot 1 and I guess, how do we think about the progression of losses on the various lots? And then second, the fact that this charge includes lots that will be in budgets in 2026 and 2027 and not come under contract for a while and not be worked on for a while. I guess how would you assess the opportunity to maybe ultimately do a little bit better than anticipated here.
David Keffer: Sure. I can start on that, Seth. I think you've read properly into the $143 million EAC adjustment with Lot 1 having been awarded and the other is not yet awarded, that one does take the form of an EAC adjustment. So that $143 million is the lot 1 amount we are currently projecting. And the future progression while we can't get into much detail because that would involve a lot sizes and quantities and other classified details. Clearly, the implication is that there's modest growth from lot 1 to future lots on average. Over time, I think you're thinking of this the right way that our current projections would indicate an average of a couple of hundred million dollars a year of after-tax impact on our -- on the cash line from B-21, and that's, as I referred to a few minutes ago, the headwind we've been able to mitigate through strength in the rest of the business. In terms of your point about opportunity to outperform that over the long-term. Clearly, it is a core focus of our team to continue to drive efficiencies in the learning curves, successful outcomes of our negotiations with suppliers. We continue to engage and partner with our customer to understand macroeconomic impacts on the program and address opportunities for funding of relief, as Kathy mentioned earlier. And so we'll continue to address all of those opportunities. This is something we'll update you in the rest of the Street on over time.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with TD Cowen. You may proceed.
Cai Von Rumohr: Thanks so much. Kathy best wishes to feel better.
Kathy Warden: It sounds like you need those wishes as well.
Cai Von Rumohr: So anyway, so you had the loss on the B-21 kind of it didn't look like a loss couple of quarters ago. You've had your second loss on Halo. This is clearly proving to be an environment where on fixed price contract, there is more risk. Have you changed your strategy regarding how you bid and specifically with reference to Tranche 2 of the tracking satellites because you were on Tranche 1 and you were not on Tranche 2. So have you changed your strategy in terms of how you're bidding? And are there any contracts that you bid before changing your strategy that would still have risk that we're not aware of today?
Kathy Warden: Very insightful question as always, Cai. So when you look back to 2015, when we did B-21, we certainly have changed our view on bidding of contracts where did not have a mature design. It's a point of bid and yet we committed to fixed price options into the future. And we have, to my knowledge, not done that again. And we have passed on some high-profile programs as a result of the risk balance that the customer put forward in the RFP not meeting our standards. We have programs like Halo, which we have certainly learned some additional lessons and are applying those as we move forward. And you note on some very recent bids, we have taken a different approach in looking at firm fixed price, where we've either declined a bit if the customer chose to go fixed price or we've offered a price -- in the case of SDA Tranche 2 that we thought was fair and reasonable and the customer decided not to further negotiate with us. These are things that are going to happen and we're going to remain disciplined. We have plenty of opportunity in this company to grow. We have a strong pipeline of opportunities we're pursuing. And a strong pipeline of opportunities that we believe have the right risk/reward balance with industry.
Cai Von Rumohr: Thanks so much. Feel better.
Kathy Warden: Thank you too.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Gavin Parsons with UBS. You may proceed.
Gavin Parsons: Thanks, good morning.
Kathy Warden: Good morning.
Gavin Parsons: Maybe just following on Ron's question. Does the B-21 charge contemplate current conditions as they are? Does it have some consideration for future uncertainty in macro or supply chain?
Kathy Warden: With all of our EACs, B-21 included, we do our best based on what we know today to project conditions out into the future. Now with that said, that's difficult to do longer-term that period of performance is. So in this case, we're looking out over greater than 5 years. So as we get into those out years, that's a bit more speculative, but we do incorporate our expectations for changes in everything from material labor pricing to productivity and learning.
Gavin Parsons: Okay. Understood. And Dave, you mentioned the IRS appeal process. Any way to put a range around the possible cash impact on that?
David Keffer: No, I'd refer you to our tax disclosures for more than enough detail on all of those fronts. It's tough to put a range around those things. We're looking forward to getting through processes, as you know, from those disclosures, we have a lot of open years that have yet to be resolved and looking forward to working with the IRS to come to reasonable resolutions there, and we'll update you on any book or tax differences from current reserves as we get there.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Scott Deuschle with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.
Scott Deuschle: Hey good morning.
Kathy Warden: Good morning.
Scott Deuschle: Dave, can you give us a sense for the proportion of supplier costs across the 5 LRIP lots that have now been fixed versus what's still open to negotiation?
David Keffer: Sure. As we noted a few moments ago, we're now at a majority of the supplier costs that have been fully negotiated across the LRIP phase. And we're in various stages of negotiation with suppliers for the remainder. So that's one area where we have learn more and progressed in our process compared to where we were a year ago or even a quarter ago.
Scott Deuschle: Okay. Great. And then just as a follow-up, where does the commercial inventory come from in the space business? And is that EBIT headwind mostly gone now? Or is there any more of that left to come in 2024? Thank you.
David Keffer: Sure. Thanks for the question. We had offsetting effects in 2024 and 2023, rather, including Q4 in the commercial elements of the space business. As you know, those are much smaller than and kind of tangential to the core national security space business that we have. In the case of those commercial inventory write-downs, those were related to newer investments in product lines to address burgeoning market opportunity in both the government and commercial elements of the space market. We did see some modest write-downs in various quarters in 2023 associated with those. Those are the types of things you occasionally go through as you make such new investments. So again, not core to the current or future growth story of the space business.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Ken Herbert with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed.
Kenneth Herbert: Yes, thank you good morning. Maybe, Kathy, at a high level, I wanted to follow up on your comments earlier regarding sort of the key margin drivers you outlined last year. Specifically more on the cost and productivity efforts and maybe on the mix side, are you seeing incrementally more opportunity now as we think about 2024? And how should we think about sort of the absolute opportunity on those now into this year versus perhaps how much more of a benefit we see in 2025 and beyond.
Kathy Warden: Thanks, Ken. We laid out 3 drivers, the first of which being stabilization in macroeconomics, and we are certainly seeing that in 2024, which is why we see our margin rates this year in line with last with some opportunity for improvement as we go throughout the year. We layer on top of that cost and productivity actions that we are taking in the company, and that will provide some tailwinds in 2024 growing tailwinds into 2025. And the mix shift really is a bit of a longer-term proposition for us. We've talked about that being a shift from cost type to fixed price, where we expect 2023 was really our high watermark for cost type, but a very gradual shift in that mix to fixed price with more of it coming in the latter half of this decade. And then international mix is the other where we don't expect significant international growth in 2024, but we do expect that to step up based on our pipeline and particularly the strong weapons demand outside the U.S. in 2025. That gives you a sense of what will be a tailwind to margin rate win.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Myles Walton with Wolfe Research. You may proceed.
Myles Walton: Thanks, good morning. I was wondering, Dave, or Kathy, you previously talked about a $4 billion free cash flow target in 2028, effectively doubling what you've done in 2023. I just want to make sure that's still on the table, despite the charge absorption in that period of time? And then maybe, Kathy, on the margin expansion specific to Aerospace, is that still a 10% margin business? Or do we have to glide slope down a little bit further into 2025, 2026.
David Keffer: Thanks for the question, Myles. Let me kick off with the 2023 free cash flow number. I appreciate the question on that because I think that too is core to the outlook going forward. Yes, we are reaffirming that $4 billion target for 2028. And essentially doubling the level that we were projecting at the midpoint of our 2023 guidance, which was $2 billion. Of course, we exceeded that by $100 million in our final result for 2023. The drivers of that growth are much of what we've talked about already. Certainly, growth in the top line. As Kathy just noted, some of the drivers of margin rate expansion opportunity which leads to margin dollars having an opportunity to exceed the growth rate of our top line through 2028. And importantly, CapEx will moderate during that same period. So we've noted that 2023 and 2024 of these peak years of capital intensity that continues to be our outlook with declines in 2025 and beyond. And then pension and tax will serve as tailwinds during that same period. So that leads you to the $4 billion number. And I think if you look at the 2024 and 2025 numbers we've reiterated for our free cash outlook today and add in that 2026 range, you'll get to that same glide slope that would push you upward toward the $4 billion number by 2028. So those are the building blocks and the way we plan to get there.
Kathy Warden: And Myles, on AS margins, what we're seeing, as Dave noted earlier is that with the B-21 growth being a bit stronger than we had anticipated, AS is stepping up on top line. It is putting some pressure on margin rate, but margin dollars are exactly where we had anticipated they would be coming into 2024, and our guide therefore, remained consistent for AS on a dollar basis, even though we now are looking at more of a mid-9s rate projection. As you go out over time, it's less dependent on what happens with absorbing that lower rate on B-21 and more what happens in terms of other new programs coming into the AS portfolio and the rate at which we will book those programs. So we'll provide you more insight into that over the coming year as we look towards 2025 and beyond.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn with Melius Research. You may proceed.
Robert Spingarn: Hey good morning. Kathy, a few minutes ago, you alluded to international and I wanted to bring up IBCS because it's had some strong demand signals from international customers and thought maybe you could dig into that program a little bit, give us a sense of how large it is in revenue or how -- in 2023 or 2024? And how big it might be, let's say, 5 years from now?
Kathy Warden: It certainly is an area of strength in our portfolio. We've seen strong performance by the team on the U.S. Army program and also as we are deploying in Poland, and we see follow-on opportunities in Poland as a result. We've also, as I’ve spoken about throughout the course of 2023, added a number of additional countries who have expressed interest in the program to the pipeline, and that's what would drive the growth that we anticipate in the 2025 time frame. As you noted, I mentioned international demand. Part of that is weapons part of that is the IBCS portfolio. And then, of course, we have some aircraft and mission system strength in the pipeline for international in 2025 as well. The program itself is growing at a fairly rapid rate, but off of a relatively small it's about $400 million of annual sales. And we expect that to grow, of course, but not a major contributor is the enterprise line for growth.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. You may proceed.
George Shapiro: Good morning. Kathy, I wanted to ask on the charge for the B-21, what caused it to be bigger than the 0 to $1.2 billion range that you've kind of been reiterating since last year? And then just specifically, maybe the margin that you had said would be around 10% is now maybe 9.5%. I know you alluded to a few minutes ago, the B-21 was growing faster. But it’s got to grow a lot faster to drop the margin by 50 basis points. So I was just wondering if you could explore that a little bit more. Thanks very much.
Kathy Warden: Let me start with the first part of your question and Dave will cover the second. As we noted, we identified this risk last year, and we, throughout the year, revisited it on a quarterly basis. There were 2 primary changes in the fourth quarter that both led us to deem it probable loss as well as impacted the value of that loss. First, we significantly reduced our projections for funding related to macroeconomic impacts, as we've talked about a couple of times already. Although we continue to partner with the government to address these impacts. We believe it's prudent in light of the current budget status to reduce those assumptions. And so we did that. The second is we've experienced growth in our cost projection, both in the internal production costs as we've continued to build aircraft as Dave talked about through our negotiations with suppliers. We have learned and built that learning into the forward-looking estimates that we now have in the EAC, so those were the factors. As we've talked about, we did a very detailed look at this EAC in the fourth quarter and had matured and had actual data to reflect on that we did not have at an earlier point.
David Keffer: Let me follow up on the second part of your question because I do think it's an important nuance. The AS business was operating in the mid-10 billions in scale over the past year, it exceeded our original expectations in sales in 2023 and now is projected to exceed them even more significantly compared to where they were a year ago in 2024. We were talking about a flat 2023 and very modest growth in 2024 based off of that mid-tens level. And now we're all the way up into the low 11s. And so that low 11s at a mid-9% margin rate is the same as the mid-to-high 10s at a slightly higher margin rate. We're really focused on driving the dollar volume of operating margin in our Aeronautics business and across our business, it's that return on invested capital, the growth in margin dollars and in free cash flow that results from it, that is really our core focus.
Todd Ernst: Josh, we have time for one more question.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our final question. Our final question comes from Jason Gursky with Citi. You may proceed.
Jason Gursky: Hey good morning everybody. Dave, just a clarification question for you to start. You mentioned in your prepared remarks that there were some shifting priorities from the government and the space business that was leading to a deceleration in growth. I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on what those shifting priorities might be? And then Kathy, I just wanted to provide you maybe a bit of an open-ended question to kind of wrap all this together here. Just broadly talk about all the risks and opportunities that you see in front of you on the execution side of things. You've obviously got record backlog here and we know about the B-21 risk. But I'm wondering if you could just maybe highlight and wrap this all together, do we have a balanced risk and opportunities portfolio here, we a little bit more overweight risk than we are opportunity? And maybe just kind of dive into a little bit of the details of what you're seeing and maybe what you're all doing to address those issues. Thanks.
David Keffer: Sure. Great questions, Jason. Let me go ahead and start with your original question on the national security space portfolio. As we mentioned, our guidance captures growth and declines in various programs across all of our portfolios, very much including space. In the case of space, as we've noted, there are some shifts in budget priorities. A lot of our customers are having to address budget prioritization, particularly as it relates to 2025 and beyond. With that said, in this particular case, given that it's in the restricted domain, there's not much more we can say about the mission or the program or anything like that. What's important there is that our space sector, and therefore, company guidance accounts for our latest understanding of all the programs in that portfolio and the likely path forward for them. And I think when you look at the space guidance, you see a lot of value creation as they continue to grow the top line. And in this case, now grow margin rates alongside that with lower capital intensity starting in 2025, in particular, you see a lot of improvement in returns on invested capital in the space business, given how much growth they've built in their foundation over the last few years.
Jason Gursky: Kathy?
Kathy Warden: And Jason, I really appreciate the question. I wish I had another hour to discuss it with you, but being respectful of everybody's time, let me just simply say that I see our portfolio and the set of opportunities and risks we have as balanced and consistent with what I have seen in recent years since I stepped into this role. We have a team who has stepped up and provided top line growth, which I believe is industry leading at about 5% on a compound annual basis each of the last four years. We're projecting that again this year. We see the opportunity space is rich, both domestically and internationally. And to the risks that we have in executing this portfolio, while the pandemic certainly made that more challenging for the last couple of years. We're turning the corner. Our overall program performance has not been stronger since I've been at the company, and that's 15 years and going. So I really feel good about how this team is positioned. We now have fully disclosed and taken into the P&L the B-21 risk, which we've been talking about and feel confident that we can now go execute this program. And I am proud of what the team collectively has accomplished across 2023 and look forward to the outlook we have in place for 2024. So with that, I just want to again thank my colleagues at Northrop Grumman for their dedication, both to our country and our company. I also want to thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call in April. So Josh, that concludes the call. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-10-26 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's Third Quarter Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. My name is Josh, and I will be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Todd Ernst, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Ernst, please proceed.
Todd Ernst: Thanks, Josh, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's Third Quarter 2023 Conference Call. On the call this morning, we'll refer to a presentation that is posted on our IR website. Before we start, matters discussed on today's call, including guidance and outlooks for 2023 and beyond reflect the company's judgment based on information available at the time of this call. They constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to safe harbor provisions of federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, including those noted in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties may cause actual company results to differ materially. Today's call will include non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to our GAAP results in our earnings release. On the call today are Kathy Warden, our Chair, CEO and President; and Dave Keffer, our CFO. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kathy. Kathy?
Kathy Warden: Thanks, Todd. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. We are all witnessing significant geopolitical tensions across the globe, including the ongoing war in Ukraine and the horrific attacks in Israel. We truly hope that peace and safety can be established for the people in these regions, and we'll continue in our steadfast support for the U.S. and our allies in their pursuit of global security and stability. On this morning's call, in addition to reviewing our third quarter results and important program events in the quarter, I'll address the U.S. budget and trends we see in the global environment. And as usual, at this time of year, I'll provide our initial outlook for next year. So starting with the quarter. Our book-to-bill was 1.5x with approximately $15 billion in awards, and our sales increased 9% year-over-year with growth across all four of our business segments. Our backlog now stands at $84 billion. It's a new record, and it strengthens the foundation for our future growth. It also continues to reflect the alignment we have with our customers' priorities and the continued success of our business strategy. Segment operating income increased by 8% year-over-year, and the OM rate increased over last quarter. Earnings per share were $6.18, up 5% compared to last year. Strong earnings rose nearly $900 million in free cash flow in the quarter, and we remain on track to achieve our 2023 free cash flow target. Excellent cash generation continues to provide us the flexibility to invest in our capabilities and capacity while returning capital to shareholders. We remain committed to returning over 100% of our free cash flow to investors this year, including $1.5 billion of share repurchases. And year-to-date, we've returned approximately $2 billion to shareholders in dividends and repurchases. So turning now to the U.S. defense budget. As is common in recent years, the federal government is operating under a continuing resolution to start fiscal year 2024. We're encouraged by bipartisan support for national security priorities and are hopeful an agreement will be reached on full year appropriations soon. Our guidance and outlook assume a full year budget is passed by the end of this calendar year or early next year. And as we saw last week, the administration continues to make supplemental request for urgent needs, including those in Ukraine and Israel to include investments in weapon systems and defense industrial-based readiness. The federal government is also developing its budget plans for fiscal year 2025, which we expect to be submitted to Congress early next year. We are working closely with our customers to plan for future capabilities and navigate the fiscal pressures they see to ensure our programs remain well supported. As we have been discussing throughout the year, we are also seeing an increase in international demand for our capabilities. We've seen a particular increase in our weapon systems portfolio and missile defense technologies like the IBCS product line. One notable example of this growing demand is with AARGM-ER where we've now received interest for more than a dozen countries and just this week, the opportunity for a foreign military sale to Finland was announced. We are also working with the U.S. government to provide new advanced weapons capabilities. During the second quarter, we received a $705 million contract from the United States Air Force to develop the Stand in Attack weapon, also known as SAW, an air to ground weapon with the capability to strike mobile defense targets. Our SAW offering builds on the capabilities we provide with our high-speed AARGM missile, which is in production. Building off a mature product baseline, we're able to reduce the developmental time, cost and risk to the SAW program. These missiles are expected to be the air-to-ground weapon of choice for the F-35 and other fighters. In our Space business, we remain focused on being at the forefront of technology, and that strategy has enabled us to build a differentiated portfolio that provides end-to-end solutions for our customers. from new space architectures to launch capabilities. We see broad applications for the technologies we've developed with a particular focus on national security missions. This includes helping to turn the Space Development Agency's vision of a new low earth orbit constellation of satellites into reality. In August, we were awarded a $712 million contract to design and build 36 satellites for SDA's tranche two transport layer data constellation. With this award, along with our work on SDA's tracking layer and tranche one of the transport layer, we are now building nearly 100 satellites for the proliferated war fighter space architecture. Our success in this area highlight our ability to compete and win in highly competitive and dynamic new markets within the space domain. In addition, we had two notable launch events in the quarter. We successfully launched our 19th resupply mission to the International Space Station as we continue to execute under NASA's commercial resupply contract. And five of our GEM 63 solid rocket boosters helped to power ULA's Atlas V launch of a national security payload. These rocket motors will continue to support future ULA launches to include ULA's Vulcan rocket. For next-generation interceptor, we successfully manufactured the first set of solid rocket motor cases in August, and we're on track for our preliminary design review in the fourth quarter, more than a year earlier than the original contract date. These are just a few examples of the focus we have on strong program performance across the portfolio. Now before I turn the call over to Dave to provide more details on the quarter, I'd like to provide some initial color on our 2024 outlook. We continue to see solid growth across all four of our businesses. with sales growth of approximately 4% to 5% compared to our latest 2023 guidance, which we've now raised by $800 million throughout the year. We also expect operating income to grow by 4% to 5% year-over-year. We reaffirm our free cash flow outlook range of $2.25 billion to $2.65 billion in 2024, which accounts for continued investment in the capabilities and capacity needed to grow our business and support our customers. So in summary, Northrop Grumman is well positioned to drive value creation for our customers and our shareholders. We are focused on executing our strategy, driving operating performance and generating cash for our disciplined capital deployment. So now with that, I'll turn it over to Dave to provide some more details on the segment results, 2023 guidance and our outlook.
David Keffer: Thanks, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. As Kathy described, we generated another strong quarter of results. The business is well positioned in growing segments of the market, and we're delivering key capabilities that address our customers' missions. As macroeconomic conditions improve, and pension and tax cash flow headwinds reverse over the next few years, we have a great opportunity to create value for shareholders through substantial cash flow growth, consistent with our long-term strategy. Taking a look at our demand metrics, we ended the third quarter with a record backlog of $84 billion, bolstered by several new competitive awards. And as a result, we now expect our full year book-to-bill ratio to be well over 1x. Turning to the top-line, we continue to build on our momentum from the first half of the year, with overall sales growth of 9% in the third quarter. This includes growth in all four of our segments for the second straight quarter as our teams continue to ramp up new wins, add new talent and manage through continued pressures in the supply chain. At the segment level, Aeronautics posted sales growth of 90%, driven by higher volume on manned aircraft programs. DS grew by 6% on continued strength in their missile defense and armaments portfolios, including IBCS, GMLRS and HAKM. Mission Systems continued to generate rapid growth of restricted sales in the Network Information Solutions business, driving their top line up 7%. In Space again delivered double-digit sales growth as a result of the continued ramp on programs like GBSD, NGI, OPIR and several in the restricted domain. Moving to segment margins. We're pleased with these bottom line results in a dynamic environment. In total, segment operating income grew by 8% compared to the third quarter of last year. As we expected, we delivered an incremental improvement in our segment OM rate from earlier quarters this year, expanding to 11.1% in Q3. Program performance remained strong across the portfolio. Our Aeronautics and Defense businesses generated a healthy volume of favorable EAC adjustments through efficient execution and risk retirements. MS margins were down slightly as mix shifted to more cost-type development efforts, particularly in their restricted portfolio. In that space, given the rapid backlog growth we've experienced, strong execution and program performance are our top priorities. Space margins improved by 80 basis points this quarter compared to Q2. Diluted EPS in the third quarter were $6.18, up 5% from the prior year. The increase was driven by higher sales and segment performance, along with a lower share count. We also recognized a gain from the sale of an Australian minority investment in Q3 that we described on prior calls and included in our guidance. Partially offsetting these items was lower net pension income of roughly $1 per share, a nonoperational impact consistent with the first two quarters. Q3 was a strong period for cash generation with free cash flow of nearly $900 million. On a year-to-date basis, this brings us to nearly $500 million of free cash flow, well ahead of where we were at this time last year. We continue to remain disciplined in managing our working capital, and we saw improvements in these accounts across the company in Q3. With respect to cash taxes, the IRS recently provided additional guidance on the amortization of research and development expenditures under Section 174 of the tax code. This guidance did not change our interpretation of the provision. But upon finalizing our 2022 tax returns, we lowered our estimates for Section 174 cash taxes based on applicable R&D costs that were below our original estimates. Offsetting the lower 174 taxes is an increase in other tax items, the net result of which is a multiyear cash tax forecast that is roughly unchanged. Moving to 2023 guidance, I'll begin with a few updates to our segment estimates as shown on Slide seven in our earnings deck. First, based on the strength of our year-to-date results, we now expect modestly higher sales in our Aeronautics business in the mid- to high $10 billion range. This represents a return to growth this year at AS, a year earlier than expected, and continues to assume that we will be awarded the first LRIP lot on the B-21 program in the fourth quarter after first flight. The Air Force said in September at the AFA Conference, we are progressing through ground testing, and we're on track to enter flight testing this year in line with the program baseline schedule. And we are again increasing our top line expectations for our Space segment based on new wins and continued strength in this business. We now expect 2023 sales of approximately $14 billion, which represents year-over-year sales growth of 14%. For operating margin rate, we're projecting a slightly lower operating margin rate at MS to reflect their year-to-date trend line. Other segments are unchanged. At the enterprise level, we're increasing our sales guidance by another $400 million and now expect 2023 sales of approximately $39 billion. This represents year-over-year growth of roughly 6.5%. We are maintaining our guidance for segment operating income. Year-to-date trends would indicate figure towards the lower half of that range, and we're reaffirming our estimates for EPS and free cash flow. Next, I'll build on Kathy's comments on our 2024 outlook. Sales growth has accelerated sooner than we expected in 2023, and we continue to project growth at all four of our business segments next year. We expect segment margins in the low 11% range, and we continue to project improvement over time as we see benefits from the stabilizing macro environment, our cost efficiency initiatives, and our business mix improvements. We continue to anticipate CapEx to be roughly consistent as a percentage of sales in 2024 before declining in 2025 and beyond. And shareholder returns will remain a top priority for our free cash flow deployment, including returning at least 100% of free cash flow to shareholders next year. Given the volatility in the financial markets, I'd also like to provide a quick update on our pension plans. Our funded status is now above 100% as of the end of Q3. And we continue to expect minimal required cash contributions over the next several years. This is a discriminator for us that supports our affordability and competitiveness as well as our capital deployment optionality. Given that our GAAP earnings per share are affected by net pension income, as we did last year, we have provided a pension income sensitivity table for 2024 on Slide 9. Our forecast in early 2023 was predicated on asset returns of 7.5% and a discount rate of roughly 5.5%. Through September 30, financial market movements have led to a roughly 50 basis point increase in discount rates and a year-to-date asset return of 1% to 2%. This combination of results would reduce net FAS pension income and increased CAS recoveries from our prior projections. Based on the sensitivities highlighted on the slide, the net result would be an impact to 2024 GAAP EPS of roughly $0.50 compared to our initial outlook provided in January. Keep in mind that FAS pension income is noncash in nature. Higher CAS estimates would provide a modest benefit to our cash flows but could have a modest downward impact on EACs in the quarter in which they are updated, consistent with this year's pattern. Speaking of cash flow, we continue to see a path to grow our cash flows at a greater than 20% CAGR next year and through 2025 with further expansion in the following years. As is our practice, we'll provide our latest multiyear outlook for free cash flows on the January earnings call. We remain confident in the long-term value creation opportunity from free cash flow expansion and disciplined capital deployment through the rest of the decade. With that, let's open the call up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Douglas Harned with Bernstein. You may proceed.
Douglas Harned: In Aeronautics, you're raising your top line guidance. Dave, you talked about this. I mean, Kathy, we've talked about this subject many times, with the valley that you had kind of forecast for revenues this year as legacy programs declined. But things are getting better. So what are the puts and takes here that appear to be starting you on a growth path going forward? And given the mix, do you still see Aeronautics is able to maintain 10% margins in the coming years?
Kathy Warden: Thanks, Doug. So the puts and takes that we've been talking about have materialized as we expected. The biggest factor was the programs that were declining are largely through our year-over-year comparison now. Those include Global Hawk, which is in sustainment; Triton, which is still in production. But as we look forward, that rate is fairly stable and so it is not contributing to significant growth. What is contributing to growth is B-21, and we expected that ramp to start this year and continue and we still anticipate that. And then other stabilizing factors of the F-35, E-2D large programs that have generally remained constant. As we look forward, we see that same profile in those program categories, and that will contribute to growth at AS. We do expect that margin rates will be near that 10% mark that we've been talking about. And we've gone through, again, those major categories of the portfolio and how they contribute. Our mature production is about 60% of the portfolio and that tends to have above 10% margins, whereas the B-21 has contributed lower margins and will, as we move into production, contribute 0 on the production. That's our planning assumption, of course. And so it's the mix of that entire portfolio that brings us to that approximately 10% expectation toward the near to midterm.
Douglas Harned: And then when you look forward into 2024, I know in the guidance today, you said 4% to 5% increase in sales, 4% to 5% increase in operating income. I mean that implies really no margin expansion overall in 2024. Can you talk about that and just how you're thinking about margin progression going forward?
Kathy Warden: Absolutely. So at this point in the year, as is normal, we wanted to provide an outlook. They are broad ranges. So the 4% to 5% both for sales and operating margin, it gives us opportunity to do further planning and characterizing of the budget as that becomes more clear, and we'll provide more precise guidance in January. What I would say is that we are still on track for the trends that we have spoken of in operating margin. We see improvements, and that is reflected in our guidance for 2023 in the fourth quarter, again, sequential improvement over Q3 performance. And we expect as we move into next year, there are continued opportunities for improvement in operating margins. They are related to macroeconomic trends largely inflation, labor cost, productivity. And so we'd like to get a little bit more time under our belt before we get concrete about what that improvement might look like. So we are expecting some modest margin rate improvement into next year as we have outlined for Q4 of this year. I also just want to point to the fact that the free cash flow growth is the real point for our investors to understand, while earnings growth will be there, we also have headwinds that have historically in the last couple of years, challenged us on free cash flow that are dissipating. We've talked about -- and I'm sure we'll talk more on today's call about Section 174, which is a decreasing headwind over time. We also see the pension headwind curtailing. And then, of course, since we reduce our CapEx spend starting in 2025, even more robust free cash flow growth. But looking at 20% year-over-year free cash flow growth is really an important milestone for us. and something we're very focused on delivering.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ronald Epstein with Bank of America. You may proceed.
Ronald Epstein: Yes. Across the industry, there's been a lot of discussion about from supply chain capacity constraints, labor constraints. One thing that's popped up in a lot of discussions is just the availability of solid rocket motors for missiles and so on and so forth. Just broadly, Kathy, how is Northrop handling? You're getting a surge in demand at a time where kind of post COVID and all that, I mean, labor has been tough and supply chains are tough. I mean how is it going? And what's Northrop doing to handle that?
Kathy Warden: Ron, we got ahead of seeing the demand, not quite to the degree that the demand has increased in the last 18 months, but we had forecasted an increase in demand, particularly in our solid rocket motor business, but broadly as we've been ramping up for production of satellites, aircraft and mission systems capability across the board. It's why our CapEx has been elevated. And so first and foremost, we did what's necessary, and that is invest in our workforce and our facilities to be able to support that demand. And it's what's allowing us to support both our direct customers and prime who are now coming to us at for that capability. We are going to continue to do that, and that's why we still have some robust CapEx plans in place for 2024 reflected in the outlook we provided. We are seeing labor back to pre-pandemic levels in terms of our ability to hire, retain. Certainly, inflation is causing more labor rate escalation than we saw pre-pandemic, but we are able to get the workers that we need. Our focus now is on productivity. And there too, we've invested in training. We've invested in standard work instructions in digital technology, all of which are enabling productivity in our workforce. That has been a little slower to materialize with our supply chain. And so we are spending a lot of Northrop Grumman resource with our suppliers, co-locating with them. and helping them to improve productivity as well. And once we remove that bottleneck, I think we'll, as an industry, be able to no longer have capacity to be our constraining factor. But with that said, and now we're looking at a supplemental and growing international demand, all of which continue to add to the demand equation. So we are still going to be a bit in a catch-up mode because it does take generally 18 to 24 months to lay in new capacity to support that demand.
Ronald Epstein: Got it. Got it. And then maybe a follow-on for Dave. Is there -- can you give us any update on how you're thinking about the B-21 LRIP? Because that's something that's kind of always on everybody's mind.
David Keffer: Sure. It's Dave. So we continue to anticipate, as we noted in the earlier part of the call that the first LRIP contract will be awarded in the fourth quarter. That's consistent with our expectations that we've described throughout the year and reliant upon first flight occurring between now and that LRIP contract award. And we continue to evaluate our performance and our outlook on the LRIP phase of the program each quarter and did not make any significant changes to our estimates for that phase during the third quarter. So we'll continue to update everyone over time as we have updates.
Operator: Our next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. You may proceed.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Kathy, you highlighted a few moments ago that free cash flow growth is the real story here. So I want to focus on that since you mentioned it. Can you talk about multiyear free cash flow growth? You've done so in the past. But how do you think about the biggest drivers from a top line networking -- net income drop-through tax CapEx perspective?
David Keffer: Sheila, it's Dave. I'm happy to provide some additional color there. The 2024 updates that we provided on the call today should give you a sense for our near-term sales and earnings growth expectations underlying that free cash flow expansion. We do expect to continue to see a leading sales profile in the growth of our business. And as we've talked about, we anticipate long-term margin expansion opportunity as well. And so both of those are foundational to our multiyear free cash flow growth expectations. On top of that, we've talked about the last couple of years that the 2023 and 2024 would be a period of peak capital intensity for the business, and that is consistent with our current expectation. Large programs that we've had for a number of years as well as new wins we've had that have grown our backlog so significantly over the past couple of years have all contributed to a peak period of capital intensity right now that we have clarity on sources of decline in the middle of the decade. And so we expect that capital intensity to be alleviating in 2025 and beyond. Working capital performance is really among the best in class at this point. And even with a modest headwind from the progress pay changes, we anticipate continuing to be able to deliver stable working capital performance, not a meaningful driver of headwind or tailwinds there. And then you get to the two items Kathy mentioned earlier, modestly higher CAS pension recoveries currently projected over the next few years. Of course, those will continue to fluctuate based on -- primarily on asset returns, but other actuarial changes that are possible as well. And then on the cash tax side, as we've noted, a pretty stable outlook for free -- for cash taxes from what we've been anticipating previously, and that outlook is for declining cash taxes over the next several years largely driven by the Section 174 movement as we get through the period of amortization over these five years. So all in all, a number of key tailwinds most critical of which, of course, is the expectation of continued growth and margin opportunity in the business.
Operator: Our next question comes from Myles Walton with Wolfe Research. You may proceed.
Myles Walton: Kathy, could you comment a bit on relative growth rates at a minimum for the segments next year? And just playing off the space backlog, which continues to expand pretty wildly, maybe just dig in a little bit deeper as to how the complexion of that backlog might play out on hopefully a margin expansion profile from here?
Kathy Warden: Yes, Myles. So as we have been saying all year long, we expect space growth to moderate as we go into next year, still be our fastest-growing segment, but the growth profile across the four businesses will be more similar next year, more tightly clustered, if you will, around that growth rate we're projecting for the enterprise at 4% to 5%. DS and MS will likely be around that profile in the mid-single-digit range, although I will say DS this year is experiencing some upward pressure on growth due to the demand that we spoke about, particularly globally for air and missile defense and weapon systems. If that continues, that would continue to push DS' growth expectations even higher into 2024. And then AS will still be in growth territory, but as we've talked about, it will be modest growth into 2024. So that gives you a sense of the relative order that we see. And for Space, in particular, while we have approximately doubled that business in the last five years, so it's been just on a tremendous growth tier. We are very focused now on the performance of that backlog and ensuring that we can, as you said, deliver the margin expansion, and that is still very much our pathway in 2024.
Myles Walton: And can you just clarify on the underlying margins, EACs were still negative within space. Is there -- and we've seen that for now five quarters. Are there programs you could point to, to say, okay, these are running off and that's why we're going to have this margin expansion profile?
David Keffer: Myles, this is Dave. On that one, there has not been any one or two particular programs driving the majority of the negative EAC adjustments you're referring to over the last year plus. It's broader. And to Kathy's earlier point, there has been so much backlog expansion that there are so many new programs in our space business over these last few years, examples of really strong market share gains. And it's been across a number of those programs that we've seen EAC pressure given the newness of those development programs. And so I wouldn't characterize them as falling off anytime soon. If anything, we see opportunities for a number of programs in our Space business to transition to more mature phases of those programs, including production phases over the next couple of years, which is important to the broader margin expansion opportunity point that Kathy described. So I think what we see here is an opportunity for margin growth as we see the continued stabilization of the macro factors that have really been underlying industry-wide pressures over the past couple of years and the continued maturity of those programs over those same couple of years coming up.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.
Kristine Liwag: Kathy, on the Stand in Attack Weapon win, some of your competitors indicated that the risk/reward profile wasn't as strong in this particular program. Can you provide more color on your competitive edge and how this pursuit drives with the risk tolerance you've demonstrated elsewhere, like on the decision not to bid on NGAD as a prime?
Kathy Warden: Yes. Thank you. So in my comments, I alluded to the fact that AARGM is a product line that we have. We've talked about the base AARGM product, the AARGM-ER, or extended range, and now the SAW award and with each of those products are building off of a mature technical baseline. As I've talked about our approach to thinking about fixed price, I have often said fixed price is appropriate where it's either a commercial item or an item that has reached a design maturity and been risk reduced to where we know what it will take to deliver that product. Because of the maturity of AARGM and us having a product line that met the Air Force requirements for SOL to bring forward, we are able to reduce cost schedule and, of course, have better risk management. That allows us to have the risk tolerance then to bid fixed price. And I recognize that in competition, there are many factors, but when a company has invested and gotten the mature product line, there is a natural advantage that comes with that. And that's the situation we found ourselves in with SAW in that specific competition.
Kristine Liwag: I had a follow-up question on the B-21. Does the current budget standoff in D.C. impacts flight testing or the timing of the LRIP award?
Kathy Warden: No, it does not. As we look at the timing of the LRIP award, as Dave said, we still expect that to happen this year. And as we have talked about before, first flight is a milestone that the Air Force is looking to achieve before they make that award, and we are on track still anticipating first flight this year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Stallard with Vertical. You may proceed.
Robert Stallard: Kathy, I just wanted to follow up on your budget commentary at the start of the call. I'm wondering if you're putting any contingency plans in place in case we get arbitrary DoD budget cuts as a result of this craziness in Congress.
Kathy Warden: So Rob, we have looked -- it would be irresponsible of us not to run some numbers and look at where we might have risk. And as I mentioned in my commentary, we are working with our customers to navigate any budget challenges that they see, either as a result of not getting appropriations passed in a timely fashion in accordance with the Fiscal Responsibility Act requirements or even as they look into 2025 and the pressures that they have there with a minimal top line growth rate. But we are not seeing any significant risks to our portfolio at this time, but we will continue to monitor that as such as discussions progress. We're just very pleased to see that the House Speaker and we should expect to begin to see those bills moving through Congress now.
Robert Stallard: Yes. And then as a follow-up, you mentioned the strong demand on the defense export market at the moment. I was wondering if there could be any capital deployment opportunities there, either Northrop Grumman acquiring companies overseas or making other investments.
Kathy Warden: We are already making capital investments that support that growing demand in missile defense and armaments. And so as we have talked about our CapEx investments over the last several years and planning forward into 2024, those do support our international product lines. We are not seeing a significant increase that we would anticipate in that demand signal yet. We are monitoring it both through the supplemental, but we've already baked in a good bit of product line growth that we've accounted for in our CapEx planning over the next several years. And so at this point in time, I don't see that providing more upward pressure on CapEx.
Operator: Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with TD Cowen. You may proceed.
Cai Von Rumohr: Yes. So to go back to Doug's question, I mean, you're looking for basically flat margins next year. And kind of in recent quarters, Kathy, you've made the point about the opportunity for space margins to go up. Certainly, if I look at defense, basically with more munitions moving up, I think you've made the point that there should be some opportunity there. You've brought the target down for MS this year, which would suggest an easier base of comparison for next year. I think you've talked about Aero as being roughly flat. But as you look at your portfolio, is there opportunity for those margins to move up next year? And if so, which of the sectors that have the greatest opportunity for margin improvement and which are the ones that perhaps face greatest risk that margins would be flat to down?
Kathy Warden: Yes. I like the way you're thinking. It's exactly the challenge that me and the team are discussing amongst ourselves is to how we do drive margin improvements next year. And in the Q2 call, I laid out for our investors what that path is and the key factors associated with improvement. And let me just touch on each of those and then I can tie it also to where the segments see the greatest opportunity. For macroeconomic factors, I've talked about those already on the call. We are seeing inflation be a bit secure than we had hoped at this point in time. We are incorporating that into our forward estimate, but it is impacting our ability to return to higher levels of profitability factor. Productivity is another area where we are working to improve productivity, not just within our company, but our supply chain. That is opportunity. That would be upside to a flattish look next year. Although, as I also indicated, we are expecting some modest improvement in margin rate next year. What then we look at is the mix, and that has been a factor for both base and mission systems over the last couple of years, particularly notable for mission systems this year. We don't see a significant mix shift going into next year. It is a very gradual mix shift. And so that -- those two pieces of the business will still feel some margin rate pressure until they can shift to more production in the portfolio. As you note, our Defense Systems business has the most both top line and margin upsize that could come as the result of growing international demand as well as what we see domestically, particularly through the supplemental. Those are uncertain at the moment. So we do factor those in our plan, but that could be a source of upsize. But then, of course, we are managing risks across the entire portfolio. And so when we put all of that together, we're looking at some modest rate improvement into next year and really striving to do better. But at this point in the year, we are very comfortable with what we've laid out as a set of expectations.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ken Herbert with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed.
Kenneth Herbert: Kathy, maybe I just wanted to follow up on the strong bookings this year. Can you call out or maybe help quantify how much of that could have been or is international? And as we think about sort of this growing set of international opportunities, maybe not so much in '24, but how much international growth could you see next year and into '25? And I guess, more importantly, how could that impact margins as I think about maybe international being slightly accretive to margins?
Kathy Warden: Yes, Ken. So you're pulling on all the right threads. Our bookings are up for the international portfolio this year. And as we look into our future plans, we expect that, that trend will continue. It takes a little while to then materialize that into sales in a meaningful way. So we see a gradual shift in terms of the percentage of our overall sales that will come from international. We've talked about achieving a double-digit growth rate. I would expect that not necessarily in 2024, but into 2025 because of the time it takes to ramp sales on these awards. And so you could also expect that any upward margin opportunity would also be more material starting in that 2025 time frame than 2024, but we are actively working those opportunities now so that they do materialize in that time frame.
Kenneth Herbert: That's helpful. And is there any way to think about just with, obviously, a lot of what we hear in the geopolitical environment, are you seeing that yet translate into sort of bid opportunities when you think about international? I'm just trying to get a sense as to with all of the -- all of sort of this growing expectation, how much you're actually seeing that yet transpire or actually materialize in terms of real opportunity you're going after?
Kathy Warden: We are seeing it in signals of demand. So I mentioned on our last call that we have over 10 countries that have expected -- expressed interest in our IBCS product line. Today, I noted another dozen or so that have expressed interest in AARGM. As we look forward, we do expect that, that demand signal for many of those countries will translate into contracts it takes time. And that's why I was talking about seeing 2024 is a time frame where we'll be working to translate those demand signals into contracts, but 2025 being more the time frame we expect them to materialize. And I'd say the same is true with the domestic marketplace as we look to replenish U.S. stockpiles or to work through the supplemental budget that I would expect to be more material for us in 2025, but we're working now to ensure that we're qualified to be a supplier on either second source or new missile programs.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Deuschle with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.
Scott Deuschle: Kathy, in the emergency supplemental request from the White House, there was $2.6 billion included for classified Air Force procurement programs. Do you have any sense for whether that could potentially help support your programs in the event that there's an extended CR here? Or is that just entirely a black box as we might otherwise expect?
Kathy Warden: Yes, there's really nothing I can comment on with regard to that, Scott. I will simply say we do continue to work with the Air Force on ensuring that we have the resources necessary to make B-21 program successful.
Scott Deuschle: Okay. Fair enough. And then Dave, the updated margin guide on MS implies something like a 15.9% margin in the fourth quarter. Just curious if you could talk a little bit about the drivers there. Obviously, you've done above 16% before so I assume something like what we've seen historically. But just curious for any commentary on drivers.
David Keffer: Sure. A couple of thoughts there. One, you saw a similar trend last year in our MS business with its strongest margin performance in the fourth quarter of the year, driven by the mix of business that we tend to see spike in the fourth quarter with more predominance of mature fixed price programs in that fourth quarter sales mix. We anticipate a similar trend this year. With that said, need to continue to perform and execute well and with efficiency across that MS portfolio to deliver on that result. In aggregate, the 23% margin guidance change for MS is really driven by mix. A lot of the growth in MS this year has been in critical work in the restricted portfolio that tends to be at this phase in its life cycle cost-type work. There is opportunity for that work to shift back towards more fixed price over time. But the fact that most of the growth in MS this year has been driven by growth in cost-type contracts has been a pressure on its margin rate. With that said, it along with the rest of our businesses drove margin dollar growth year-over-year in Q3, and we anticipate the same trend in Q4.
Operator: Our next question comes from Gavin Parsons with UBS. You may proceed.
Gavin Parsons: Dave, I was hoping you could go into just a little bit more detail on the Section 174 change and what the offset is given it would seem like that has to be pretty sizable, especially if you get some recapture from 2022?
David Keffer: Sure. Happy to go into that. I think the important takeaway here is that our cash tax forecast is, in the aggregate, largely unchanged, and that remains a tailwind for our free cash flow outlook over these next several years. To your point, 174-driven taxes have come down a bit in that outlook. That's largely due to lower-than-projected cost applicable to the 174 guidelines, not a change in our interpretation of the latest guidelines. To be clear there, we will continue to assess any future guidance that comes out on 174 and continue to apply our best interpretation of that guidance to our own costs and the appropriate and applicable cost there. With that said, the issue that others in the industry have discussed around the difference between cost type and fixed price R&D-related expenditures is less impactful for us than it appears to be for some of our peers, particularly given the reduction in our 2022 174-driven costs. So less of an impact based on our interpretation than for others. So with all of that said, there are some puts and takes across a business of our scale with as many open tax years as we have, and we disclose all this in some clarity in our 10-Qs every quarter. There is a balance of upside and downside items that are largely driving an unchanged cash tax forecast.
Gavin Parsons: Got it. That's helpful. Kathy, you mentioned stickier inflation. Any update on discussions with customers for relief on that front?
Kathy Warden: Discussions continue, and I think we're making good progress in having awareness of the issue. And with Congress setting a precedent last year of having some funds available, I'm hopeful that once again this year, we will see funds appropriated that give the departments the flexibility, both in language and dollars to address these issues.
Operator: Our next question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. You may proceed.
Seth Seifman: Apologies to be deep in the weeds on the taxes, but kind of what I got left here now. And so I just wanted to ask you, Dave, just to understand that a little better and your interpretation of this. If I look at what Lockheed paid in 174 payments last year, it was like 38%, 39% of their IRAD and you guys paid like 75% of your IRAD. So it would seem like that's a very different interpretation. And it would seem like there -- the guidance is consistent with the idea that IRAD is kind of the basis of what's subject to Section 174. And so maybe if you can provide -- I know we spoke about this, but just a little bit more color on what's different about your business.
David Keffer: So I appreciate the question, Seth. I know it's been a common line of discussion for us, and it's an interesting topic. I would say this probably isn't the time or the place for us to assess differences in our own interpretation of guidance from peers. We're not familiar with the interpretations of our peers. When it comes to our own view of Section 174, it is broader than IRAD and includes a portion of our contract-driven R&D as well. With that said, as I mentioned, we'll continue to assess potential future guidance, even following on and clarifying guidance provided in September. And we're open to different interpretations based on different guidance we may get in the future. But importantly, as I mentioned, a difference in contract type interpretation is not nearly as impactful for us as others have said it is for them. And so I think, in aggregate, this should be less of a focus. That interpretation difference should be less of a focus for the Street going forward than it has been for us in the recent past. And the important point to take away is that our cash tax forecast hasn't changed in any meaningful way and remains a tailwind for us. It's a small piece of the much more important puzzle that is really strong free cash flow growth opportunity for us over these next five years, leading to a lot of optionality as it relates to capital deployment. And I think that's the more important headline.
Operator: And our final question comes from David Strauss with Barclays. You may proceed.
David Strauss: Wanted to ask specifically on B-21 and your guidance for -- it sounds like 10% margins at AS next year. Are you assuming, Kathy, any incremental inflation [indiscernible] on B-21 in that?
Kathy Warden: So we look at the EAC, and it has a number of factors incorporated into our expectations performance, our expectations for the contract terms. And so all of that is factored into what goes into the expectations that I laid out for B-21. And as we've consistently said through the year, we are planning at a zero profitability. But we have to perform and we are working hard to ensure that, that plan is what we achieve.
David Strauss: Okay. And apologies, Dave, I got to go back to Section 174. Just to level set us, are you -- in your free cash flow forecast this year, are you still assuming $700 million impact from Section 174 and stepping down roughly 20% from there next year?
David Keffer: No, I appreciate the clarifying question. We have stepped down about 20% below our prior estimates for the impacts of the annual effect of Section 174, and we've detailed that further in our 10-Q in terms of the impacts on 2022, 2023 and beyond based on the numbers that we've calculated with the benefit of actual cost to apply as we have formulated our 2022 tax return. So it's a bit lower than that. As I mentioned, that's offset by a couple of factors moving in the other direction, which in aggregate, leads to no change in our cash tax forecast for this year or the next couple of years. So no change to that element of the free cash flow guidance.
Kathy Warden: Thanks, David. So quickly before concluding the call, I just want to take a moment to acknowledge our team and thank them for their contributions to our company and our customers. And in particular, I want to thank our General Counsel Sheila Cheston, who is retiring after 13 years with the company. Sheila has been instrumental in instilling a culture of strong ethics and she has provided outstanding counsel for the company and been a trusted partner to the Board and to me and the leadership team. Kathy Simpson is our new General Counsel. She is also a valued member of our team. She's been with us for many years, and she brings a wealth of broad-based legal and strategic expertise to the role. So we're thrilled to have her. And I also want to congratulate Rob Fleming, our new Space System Sector President and thank Tom Wilson for his leadership in guiding the space business for the last several years during a period of just tremendous growth. Tom is now taking a new role with the company who's going to help us expand our business development capabilities across the entire enterprise. And Rob has extensive experience running complex businesses during his 18 years with our company. He most notably and recently led the Strategic Space Systems division, which is the largest segment of our space sector, and I think what you see from our team is that the depth and strength of our team allows us to make these internal transitions very smoothly. I'm looking forward to working them and them meeting you in future years. So thank you for joining the call today, and we look forward to speaking with you again on our fourth quarter call in January.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-07-27 09:00:00) =====
Todd Ernst: Thanks, Josh. And good morning and welcome to Northrop Grumman second quarter 2023 conference call. We will refer to a PowerPoint presentation that is posted to the IR website on the call this morning. Before we get started, matters discussed on today's call, including guidance and outlooks for 2023 and beyond reflect the company's judgment based on information available at the time of this call. They constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to safe harbor provisions of Federal Securities Laws. For looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, including those noted in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties may cause actual company results to differ materially. Today's call will include non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to GAAP results in our earnings release. And on today's call are Kathy Warden, our Chair, CEO and President and David Keffer, our CFO. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kathy, Kathy?
Kathy Warden: Thanks, Todd. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us. As you saw from this morning's earnings release, global demand for Northrop Grumman solutions is driving exceptional growth. In the second quarter, our sales were up 9% with solid contributions from each of our four business segments. Our ability to hire and retain talent and improving supplier deliveries are strengthening our top line. Even our year-to-date sales increase of 7% and an improved outlook. We're increasing our full year's sales guidance range by 400 million. In addition, award volume in the quarter was robust, with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.14. As a result, we're increasing our full year book-to-bill projection to approximately 1.0. Our $79 billion backlog continues to be more than two times our expected 2023 sales supporting our long term growth outlook. We delivered solid second quarter earnings per share of $5.34. And we're increasing the lower end of our full year guidance range by $0.20. And free cash flow was healthy in the quarter more than a billion dollar higher than Q2 of last year, positioning us well for our full year target. Turning to the budget environment and starting with the U.S. We're encouraged by the continued bipartisan support for national security funding to implement the administration's national defense strategy. The FY ‘24 budget and recent congressional committee bill prioritize modernization including areas of strength in our portfolio, such as the triad, the space domain, information superiority, and advanced weapons. We also anticipate continued support for Ukraine and related emergency spending, which would represent even further increased demand. Global demand for our products also continues to grow as our allies increase defense spending to address evolving threats. We are well positioned in multiple markets to meet this demand with programs such as [Argonne] IBCS and E2-D as well as munitions. With a robust backlog and leading growth outlook. I'd like to now spend a few minutes outlining our path to margin expansion, which is a key element of our earnings and cash flow growth plan. Our 2023 operating margin dollar guidance is in the range we've previously provided. This guidance implies a segment margin rate in the mid 11% range in the second half of 2023. Having delivered a rate of 10.9% in the first half. We also see an opportunity to increase our year-over-year margin rate in 2024, and get to a 12% target in the longer term. Achieving this margin improvement is built on three key drivers. First, is the stabilization of temporal macro economic factors that have driven higher cost and impacted our supply chain and labor efficiency. Second, is the ongoing implementation of cost management programs across the company that helps drive affordability, competitiveness, and performance. And third is our business mix, which we see shifting to more international and production contracts. As international demand grows, and many of our current development programs mature over the next several years. With regard to the macro economic factors, supply chain disruptions rooted in the pandemic, and the subsequent labor market tightness, have created programs delays and cost growth. To reduce this disruption, we're buying ahead of schedule pursuing second sources where it makes sense and placing more of our people at suppliers to facilitate timely material delivery. We see signs of progress across our supply chain from these actions. And we are seeing fewer new issues emerge. We've had exceptional performance in growing our headcount since the second half of 2022, and attrition rates are down to pre pandemic levels. Our focus now is on optimizing labor efficiency, which is an important driver of profitability. To accelerate the learning curve for our employees. We're leaning forward with innovative training programs and standardizing work instructions. Inflation has been a challenge for industry as well as others, cost growth has now begun to moderate. But the last 18 months of inflation continue to have a higher base effect on our costs, especially in labor. If you look at our year end 2021 fixed price backlog, it was largely priced before we began to experience elevated levels of inflation. However, of that backlog, approximately 70% will have been converted into sales by the end of this year. And for new bids, we are factoring higher inflation expectations into our contracts. We're also working to drive additional discipline in our bid approaches, particularly on fixed price contracts to help protect against these types of dynamics in the future. Overall, we anticipate that these macro economic impacts have stabilized and now have largely been incorporated into our margins risk factors. The second key driver of margin opportunity is cost management, which benefits both affordability and competitiveness. We are laser focused on overhead cost reduction. A foundational element of these reductions is our implementation of digital solutions across our business, which will help to drive performance and productivity. For example, we've built a digital ecosystem that focuses on program execution, bringing together employees, customers and partners into an integrated environment, so they can seamlessly work together. This accelerates design, integration, testing and deployment across programs helping us to deliver with quality, speed and efficiency. We're increasing the number of programs that are operating in this ecosystem. And today, we have over 100 active programs that are doing so, we're also investing in and advancing the technologies and digital systems in our factories. We're scaling this across the enterprise to drive efficiencies that should benefit all of our stakeholders. For example, on the B-21 we've successfully demonstrated the use of this digital thread high to advanced manufacturing technology to realize over 15% labor efficiencies in one area of the build. And in June, we launched the expansion of this approach across the whole build process. We're extending this digital thread into our business operation to deliver further benefits across the company. This includes how we're managing our supply chain, where we've broadly centralized procurement, and we're working to leverage our purchasing power to reduce costs. We have over 20,000 suppliers and we've begun securely connecting them into our digital ecosystem. Over the next several years, we expect to have the majority of our supply base fully integrated, this is expected to lower supplier costs and significantly improve productivity. The third key area of margin opportunity is our business mix. For several years we've had one of the highest cost plus development contract mixes in the industry reflecting our significant early stage position on key franchise programs, which will transition to production throughout this decade. This cost plus mix has been increasing with our first house revenue at 55% Cost Plus up from about 50:50 last year. Looking forward, we see this shifting towards more fixed price revenue, rising to approximately 60% of sales by 2027. As a number of large programs in all four of our sectors transition to production. Production program margins are typically a few points higher than development margin. So mix shift can contribute meaningfully to our segment operating margin rates. And we're making good progress on moving programs through development and into production. For example [Argonne ER] completed its fifth consecutive test flight in the second quarter. This program is nearing completion of its development phase, and is on track to ramp production volumes next year. And on B-21, we successfully powered on the first flight test aircraft in the quarter another important milestone in our campaign to achieve first flight in transition to production. We also expect our international business to grow at a double digit rate over the next few years, improving our margin opportunity as global sales become a larger percentage of our mix. In the second quarter, we demonstrated our IBCS solution for eight potential international customers, reflecting growing demand for this advanced air and missile defense capability. We also signed a memorandum of agreement with Rheinmetall to expand capacity for F-35 center fuselage production in Europe. We expect these three drivers to result in improved affordability, even better performance and higher margins. When combined with the strength of our backlog and increasing global demand. These operating margin improvements should provide the foundation for strong future free cash flow growth. Now with respect to capital deployment, we're executing a strategy that prioritizes investments to support our business plan and returns cash to shareholders. In May we increased our dividend for the 20th consecutive year by 8%. Year-to-date, we have returned $1.5 billion to shareholders and are on track to meet our goal of returning more than 100% of free cash flow this year. Overall, the global defense budget outlook and our alignment with customer priorities give us confidence in our growth trajectory. We are focused on margin expansion opportunities and converting this to free cash flow growth to deliver value both for our customers and our shareholders. So with that, I'll hand it over to Dave and he'll cover details of the second quarter financial results and updates to our full year outlook.
David Keffer: Thanks, Kathy. And good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report another solid quarter, we remain focused on executing our strategy and believe we're well positioned to grow our topline earnings and cash flows for years to come. The demand environment continues to be robust, supported by the alignment of our portfolio with our customers highest priority missions. And those Kathy described, we see a path to expand margins in the second half of this year and beyond. As macro pressures ease and we drive efficiencies into our business as it grows and experiences mixed tailwinds. Now turning to Q2 results, we generated $10.9 billion of new awards, a higher total than we previously expected, our book-to-bill was 1.14 and was driven by restricted awards of $5.4 billion. This brings our year-to-date total to $8.6 billion in restricted bookings. Looking forward, we expect a number of production awards in the second half of the year, including the first lot of B-21 LRIP. Moving to sales on Slide 4 in our earnings deck, we’ve delivered strong topline growth of 9% in the second quarter. Building on the momentum from Q1 as a result of our success in bringing on new employees, incremental improvements in the supply chain and continued backlog strength our sales are growing at a higher rate, and we've increased our full year guidance. With respect to segment results all four of our businesses grew in the second quarter. Space continues to lead the way with their second consecutive quarter of 17% sales growth as GBSD, NGI and restricted space programs continue to ramp. In defense system sales increased 10% on the strength of their armaments and Missile Defense franchises. Mission Systems growth of 5% was driven by restricted programs in the networked information solutions business and aeronautics systems returned to growth as higher volume on restricted programs outpaced the headwinds on legacy programs as we've anticipated. Turning to Slide 5, segment margins in the second quarter were 11%. Keep in mind that Q2 of last year included over $70 million or 80 basis points of benefit from a land sale and a contract related legal matter. Most importantly, margin dollars improved incrementally from Q1, largely meeting our expectations. Program performance remains strong across the portfolio, as the team does a good job in navigating the lingering disruption from the pandemic and macro economic factors we've been discussing. One area of pressure we experienced in the quarter was a $36 million unfavorable adjustment on NASA's habitation and logistics outposts program or HALO in our space system sector. Moving to earnings per share on Slide 6, diluted EPs in the second quarter were $5.34. This included lower net pension income of roughly $1 per share partially offset by more favorable returns on marketable securities than in the same period last year. Slide 7 highlights the non operational pension headwinds we experienced in Q2 on a year-over-year basis 2023 pension income will be lower for all periods when compared to 2022. But these headwinds are expected to dissipate as we look to 2024. With respect to cash, we generated strong free cash flow in the second quarter of over $600 million, a significant increase compared to the same period last year in which we had an outflow of $460 million. This improvement was driven by increased billings and timing of collections across the company. We paid roughly $360 million of cash taxes associated with section 174. And we continue to expect a full year impact of a little over $700 million. Moving to 2023 guidance. We'll start with a few updates to our sector estimates which you can see on Slide 8, our space business continues to deliver outstanding sales growth and bookings, demonstrating the strength of its diverse portfolio capabilities. As a result, we're increasing sales guidance for space to the high $13 billion range. Remember, as recently as 2019, this business was generating revenue in the mid $7 billion range. So our guidance this year reflects a Fantastic Four year CAGR of roughly 17%. At defense systems based on the strength of their year to their year-to-date results, we're increasing our full year expectations for this business to the mid to high $5 billion range. This represents growth in the low single digit range. There are no changes to our revenue expectations at [AS or MS]. With respect to margin rates. We're maintaining our expectations for as AS, DS and MS and we're projecting a lower operating margin rate at space to reflect the rapid increase in new program winds and their first half results. At the company level, this translates to an increase to our sales guidance of $400 million in a growth rate between 4% and 6% for the full year, we're maintaining our expectations for segment operating income dollars, we expect a slightly higher full year tax rate of 17% and we reduced our projection for shares outstanding to the mid $152 millions to reflect our latest share repurchase expectations. Our EPS outlook continues to assume Q3 Closer of the sale of the minority investment for which we increased our full year EPS guidance by $0.40 last quarter. This quarter, we're increasing the lower end of our guidance range by $0.20. We remain on track with our full year outlook for cash and continue to expect to grow our free cash flow to about $3 billion by 2025. This represents a greater than 20% CAGR driven by the growth of our business and structural tailwinds from cash taxes, lower CapEx and higher CAS recoveries. In over the next five years, we see an opportunity to approximately double our current level of free cash flow. Lastly, we continue to execute our balanced capital deployment plan. This includes investments of over $2.8 billion in R&D and CAPEX this year and returning excess capital to shareholders via our quarterly dividend and share repurchase plans. For the year, we continue to expect to return over 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders, including roughly $1.5 billion in share repurchases. We also plan to retire $1 billion of notes that mature in August, and we don't have any additional bond maturities until 2025. Overall, the Northrop Grumman team delivered a strong first half of the year, our business strategy is working and we're continuing to drive additional growth in sales earnings in cash. With growing global demand for a portfolio of solutions and solid program performance. We're building long term value for all our stakeholders. With that, let's open up the call for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research you may proceed.
Robert Stallard: Thank you so much. Good morning.
Kathy Warden: Good morning.
Robert Stallard: A couple of questions from me. First of all, Kathy, thanks for your commentary on the margin expectations for the next few years. But I was wondering, as you talk about this, what are you expecting on the B-21 LRIP? Is that still anticipated to be around a sort of breakeven margin in your expectation? And then secondly, does the end of the F-18 have an impact on this?
Kathy Warden: Rob, thanks for the questions. So as we look at the profile going forward for B-21 as we've noted before, we are not planning to have margin from the LRIP contracts. So when I talk about our Merchant projections going forward and anticipate that I will remind you we still have the risk factor associated with B-21 as we look at inflationary impact. In the quarter, we did receive notification that the DOD has allocated $60 million for B-21 LRIP procurement due to inflationary impact and we expect that to be awarded later this year. But keep in mind, this only applies to the one fiscal year it's associated with FY ’23 and we continue to work closely with the government on an effort to address the impacts of macroeconomic disruptions. With regard to your question about F-18. Yes, our projections also incorporate the wind down of the F-18 production line. We have been anticipating that it is built into our plans if we think about our production profile over time, that mix is being driven not just with aerospace programs like B-21, transitioning to production and F-35 continuing to grow. It is built on our entire portfolio. All four of our segments will see programs shifting from development to production in that timeframe and that mix shifting. Okay, then just a quick follow up on the HALO program. Could you clarify if this is a fixed price development program or if it doesn't, has a different contractual structure? Thank you.
Kathy Warden: It is a fixed price program. We had worked with the government in a cost plus structure through the preliminary design review. So we had a more mature design before transitioning into a fixed price contract structure. And as I noted in my comments, we’re being even more disciplined moving forward in ensuring that we work with the government to have the appropriate use of fixed price contracts. We think that is best applied for commercial items or production programs with stable requirements in mature design is it's turning out on the HALO program. The requirements are not as stable as we or the government anticipated. And we're working with them to address that change management as we go forward.
Operator: Thank you, one moment for questions. Our next question comes from Richard Safran with Seaport Global Partners. You may proceed.
Richard Safran: Kathy, David, Todd, good morning. How are you?
Kathy Warden: Good morning.
Richard Safran: So, you've been a bit reluctant to talk about this so far, but I thought I'd see if you'd comment on the NGAD Sixth-Generation Fighter Program since the Air Force just recently announced the competition. What I'd like to know is if you're thinking about bidding this as a prime, and I'd also like to know if you could, if this program is considered part of your, your growth strategy, so any color you could provide that would be helpful. Thanks.
Kathy Warden: Thanks, Rich. Yes, before the government officially announced the program and they're intend to issue the RFP we had been quiet. But we have notified the U.S. Air Force that we're not planning to the NGAD RFP as a prime. We are responding to other bidders request for proposal as a supplier that's particularly in our mission systems portfolio. And as I noted in my remarks, we are remaining disciplined in assessing the right programs to pursue. And that's ones where we feel we're well positioned with a mature offering. And with the business deal reflects an appropriate balance of risk and reward for both the customer and the industrial base. So the [novice] decision on this program doesn't impact our path to sales and earnings growth at [NGAD] we have a strong backlog in that sector and we have other opportunities and military aircraft that we are pursuing.
Richard Safran: Okay, thank you.
Kathy Warden: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you one moment for questions. Our next question comes from Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may proceed.
Ron Epstein: Yes. Hey, good morning, everybody. I guess I have to dig down a little bit further on that with that no bid, also crossover to FAXX? Or do you -- at a related program or a different program? How should we think about that? Or is that when you want to be a supplier on as well?
Kathy Warden: Well, I'll just say that, when I noted we have other opportunities we are pursuing. I won't disclose at this point exactly what those are a little more information comes out on other programs. But you could assume that if we feel we're well positioned, and the government is appropriately balancing risk and reward as I said that that would be a program we would pursue.
Ron Epstein: Got it? Got it. Got it. Got it. Okay, cool. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley, you may proceed.
Kristine Liwag: Hey, good morning, guys. And maybe following back up on those two questions, I mean, not bidding as a [prime] and NGAD. Kathy, is this part of your strategy in terms of maintaining, margin growth in the next few years? Because, we look at historically you guys had walked away from T-7, you'd walk away from the [tanker], and avoided the Winner's Curse. Is that how to think about the strategy for this program? Or are there other factors in play that we should consider?
Kathy Warden: Oh, Kristine, certainly your words, not mine. But we do feel that discipline has served us well in the past and selecting how much risk to take and what to pursue. And we've learned lessons from some of our own experience as well. So we are applying those as we think about what to bid and what not to bid going forward. And that is critical to us, expanding our margins back to what investors expect of this company. And it's the three factors I mentioned. But the discipline, and ensuring we have the right combination of risk reward is important. And it's not just important for us to be able to meet our commitments to investors, but for the entire industrial base to remain healthy, so that we can have industrial base that investors want to invest in.
Kristine Liwag: Great, thank you. I'll keep it to one.
Kathy Warden: Thanks, Kristine.
Operator: Thank you, one moment for questions. Our next question comes from Doug Harned with Bernstein. You may proceed.
Doug Harned: Good morning. Thank you. On the margin question, even when we look at history, generally inflation, it doesn't affect defense companies that much. And we've obviously seen a very difficult two years where it rose, and you've talked about this rose very quickly, and you've had to absorb costs and fixed price contracts. When you look forward. You talked about being able to run out some of the contracts that were priced before we had that higher inflation level. But when you look at repricing contracts that go into next tranches, new work, do you expect that you're going to be able to get back to be able to price off a base cost level that could allow you to have the same kind of performance we saw in the sense in the pre COVID era?
Kathy Warden: Yes, Doug, we do expect that to be the case, the government will look at the actual that we have experienced and the inflationary pressures are absolutely showing up not only in labor but material which then provide us the basis to work with the government and negotiate half of those hire, half in the future contract.
Douglas Harned: And then, clearly and it sounds like you're looking at this so over the next 12 months or so you see this shift but clearly it also requires more money in the budget. We saw a lot of money come in in '23 budget from the senate last year. But you're expecting then in the budget to also be able to cover these higher costs?
Kathy Warden: I expect that the budget will need to incorporate these higher costs to the extent that inflation exceeds the growth of the overall budget, they could of course be supplemental or priority. Will be made in terms of what the government will buy. We've already seen for the government happening to reduce quantities on program from their anticipated level which you address the higher cost coming in based on the inflation and we expect that to continue for the foreseeable future as the contracts come up for renewal.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for question. Our next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. You may proceed.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Good morning, guys. Thank you. I want to ask about space specifically fees. Your revised guidance takes into account $1.6 billion of sales growth in 2023. Can you maybe bucket this growth for us and where is it coming from, how much of it is GBSD and how do we think about the margin implications of this growth given the quarter?
Kathy Warden: So, a good bit of the growth has been and continue this year to come from two programs: GBSD and MGI. We have talked about that been approximately half of the growth and the other half coming from a broad set of programs but most notably our national security portfolio which is about 80% of our overall revenue in the space business. And the margin profile is similar across those businesses with early space development being lower margin as we shift into production there like we talked about earlier on the call will present the opportunity for space margins to continue to expand. But we're really pleased with the 9% that we're seeing there. Obviously we work to get that closer to 10% through the work that we're doing, there is some performance. And in the longer-term is mix as seen and have the part potential to go even higher. But when you look at 9% for a business, that is the door, that type of growth and been able to continue to manage through the disruption of the macroeconomic environment. We feel like we're in a good place.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Matt Akers with Wells Fargo. You may proceed.
Matt Akers: Hey, good morning. Yes, thanks for the question. I want to ask about and I think there was a GAO reporter in the quarter that customer maybe some schedule rips on that program, I think it's cost-plus any have been, just your thoughts on how that programs going, is there maybe any riskier than that?
Kathy Warden: Yes, thanks for the question. So, this is in regards to Sentinel or GBSD as many of you know it. And there was a GAO report that's focused schedule pressure. We've been talking about that and the U.S. Airforce has as well as we have seen disruption in supply that has flowed through to schedule pressure on the program. We're in the process of working with the Airforce on looking to optimize the schedule to see what we can pull outward obviously it's shifting right and how we can maintain the initial operating capability day which is the primary focus of the government, so that we cannot place those missiles in silos as anticipated later in the decade.
Matt Akers: Okay, thanks. And then, if I could follow-up. I guess maybe on working capital. Dave, I don’t know if you could comment on your thoughts on how that progresses in the second half?
David Keffer: Sure, thanks Matt. We continue to feel really good about our working capital status as efficient I think as any across the industry and particularly strong in the second quarter. We mentioned a $1 billion of improvement year-over-year in free cash flow that was bolstered by the strength of our invoicing and collections efforts during the quarter which puts us in good status. We think about where we stand year-to-date compared to a year ago. We continue to expect a kind of typical seasonal pattern with the strongest free cash flow and therefore working capital efficiency in the fourth quarter of the year. But overall feel good about our working capital efforts.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Peter Arment with Baird. You may proceed.
Peter Arment: Yes, thanks. Good morning, Kathy, Dave, Todd. Hey Kathy, thanks for your comment on the mix and kind of the longer-term outlook on where that transitions from cost plus to kind of fixed price mix for the company. Is 2023 kind of the peak year or is it more like next year for cost plus and just a related to kind of just your comments on working capital. How do we think about the working capital profile kind of over that similar period? Is that like a that does have become a headwind or is it an opportunity for you. Thanks.
David Keffer: Thank you, Peter. I'll start with your mix question. Yes, this is the year to think of as the higher water mark for cost type work given where we are in the development cycle particularly on many of our largest programs. We mentioned we've been in the 55% of sales range in terms of the cost plus mix in the first half of the year. We expect that to ease slightly in the second half, well it's really over the next four five years we'll see that shift back to the other side of 50/50 and toward that 60/40 fixed price mix that we described in our prepared remarks. So, that is a meaningful opportunity for us in terms of margin expansion as we help deliver those capabilities to our customers in the production phases of the programs. Working capital longer-term, as I mentioned, we're really pleased with our working capital efficiency when we think about where we finish 2022, where we project 2023 finishing as well. And so, we don’t think of working capital as a source of a lot of upside opportunity for additional efficiency over the next five years nor do we think of it as an area of expected headwind. I think it'll be more neutral than that. So, when you think what will drive that opportunity to double our current run rate of free cash flow over the next five years, think of it in terms of growth in the sales volume of the business, the margin rate opportunity we've been talking about and the conversion of those margin dollars to cash flow that certainly the number one effort and the number one driver. But then, coinciding with that you'll see a decline in demand for capital expenditures where peak levels in '23 and '24 around capital intensity, that will ease to a more historical levels over the next five years. You'll see some increase in CAS funding over the next couple of years in our in the projections we've outlined over the last few quarters. And then cash taxes will decline based on current tax law particularly related to the amortization requirements for R&D.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for question. Our next question comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. You may proceed.
George Shapiro: Yes, hello. On the options for the B-21, I mean you still got the same commentary in the queue. I think that you've been expecting the first option to get called in the third quarter. Is that the time yet that we'd expect to see some real update on what the losses might be. And if that will you sit there and provide a number for that one option and then subsequently rate fill other options are exercised and what you're thinking as to how you will handle that. Thanks.
David Keffer: Hey George, it's Dave. So, as we talked about on the call, the first flight at aircraft was successfully powered on in Q2. We remain on track for first flight this year. Again, that timing continues to depend on events and data of course over time. And we anticipate that that first LRIP contract will be awarded following first flight. We will continue to evaluate the performance in the outlook for B-21 LRIP as well as the EMD portion of the program on a quarterly basis and provide updates as we have them. Of course, those will be informed by continued progress in driving efficiencies on the program as well as our understanding of that first LRIP contract lot and beyond. So, we'll take all of that into account each quarter as we update our thinking.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for questions.
Kathy Warden: Go ahead, well you can give us a follow-up.
David Keffer: We can take that one follow-up if you don’t mind.
Operator: Oh, no problem. [Audio Gap] -- 9% or so. So, about half what you experienced in the first step. Can you provide reasons for that slowing?
David Keffer: Sure. A few things I'd point out there. Obviously the growth rate for the year for space is increased with its guidance update to the low double-digits now and we're really pleased with that. The first half of the year has been close to that 17% range. Some of what you see there is just a matter of the year-over-year compares where the first two quarters of the year were a bit lighter compared than Q4 in particular. And that’s frankly the case across the business. We had a tremendous Q4 for sales volume in 2022, so we anticipate that the touch compare will lead to a lighter year-over-year growth rate in the second half of the year across all four of our segments as we get to Q4. But overall the sequential growth is where we'll continue to look for from space and other sectors. When you look across the company, you've got about 51% of our sales guidance in the second half, 49% in the first half. So, you see the demonstration of continued sequential growth and the year-over-year growth rates are more of a matter of those compares.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Thanks very much, Dave.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. You may proceed.
Seth Seifman: Hey, thanks very much. Good morning. I wanted to ask first about space and it seems like definitely I appreciate the detailed commentary on the overall margin outlook. It seems like space has been the business where a lot of that margin pressure has been felt most not just maybe from foreseeable things like mix but from surprises that have caused the company to go down the margin there. What is it about the portfolio in space that's driving that now? And how do you assess the risk from here, is space still the sector where there is maybe the most margin risk due to continued work on fixed price development programs like HALO and maybe exposure to either the SDA Tranches which I think are also kind of fixed price development work. How do you see that now?
Kathy Warden: So, overall the space business is performing very well. We certainly have pockets on certain programs that we are focused on continuing to improve the disciple around tower managing those efforts along with the customer. And so, I don’t see space as majorly different than any other segments of our business in terms of risk profile aside from mix. Certainly there is more risk in development programs and that's why we generally have where our margin rate coming out of development. But as space has transitioned programs to later stage developments in production, their performance has out solid the rest of the business and we expect that to continue.
Seth Seifman: Great. And maybe just as a quick follow-up in AI. Perhaps feudal attempt to bring out a little bit more information about the NGAD strategy. I believe the collaborative combat aircraft portion of NGAD is a separate solicitation. Are you planning to pursue that?
Kathy Warden: It is a separate solicitation and we're looking at it closely.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Myles Walton with Wolfe Research. You may proceed.
Myles Walton: Thanks. Good morning. Kathy, you mentioned margin expansion in '24 but obviously the margins for '23 in the guidance have actually come down. So, I'm just wondering could you put a quantum to the margin expansion you're looking for in '24 as it to just get back to where prior '23 was. And then maybe for Dave just a clarification, the 10-Q mentions a $100 million gain in the third quarter. That is into new guidance, I wouldn’t imagine just yet, is that correct?
Kathy Warden: So, I'll start and then turn it to Dave. As I think about margin profile, we do expect the second half of this year to be stronger than the first half and based on our guide you could expect us to see that progress that we have largely from macroeconomic disruptions dissipating through the year to continue into 2024. The mix shift that I focus is more gradual. I talked about that shift toward 60% fixed price in 2027, so you could think of that as a progression through 2024 to those later years. And so, we're not going to guide today around 2024. We will provide just some more specifics as the year progresses and certainly at the beginning of the year next year. But you could think of it as a steady progression of improvement not a dramatic change from where we've been performing this year.
David Keffer: And I could touch on the $100 million gain you referenced that that's just an approximation, of course we've until that closes. We do expect that sale of an international minority investment to close in Q3. And that's the item for which we'd increased our guidance range by $0.40 last quarter. So, that is incorporated into our guidance net, net we see that in that $0.40 range of benefit to the company. So, we're pleased to have that approaching and look forward to the cash inflow from it as well.
Myles Walton: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for question. Our next question comes from David Strauss with Barclays. You may proceed.
David Strauss: Good morning, and thank you.
Kathy Warden: Kathy, so you're -- the growth rates accelerated a little bit faster in '23 than you had initially anticipated. As we think about '24 with AES returning to growth and I assume space growth slowing a little bit. Would you expect topline growth in a similar range or is it possible that we could still see an acceleration next year overall for the company evolve. Thanks.
Kathy Warden: Right. So, we're really pleased with the progress that we've seen this year, our sales guidance increasing at space and TS and our other two sectors continuing to see progression towards their growth objectives as well. As we think about this year, a good portion of that growth is the strong backlog that we developed and continued win of competitive bid. Part of it too though is what we've been talking about with the phenomena of having supplier deliveries to late last year and starting to come in this year having ramped our headcount significantly in the latter part of last year and early part of this year, is contributing to growth rate. Those elements you wouldn’t think of as it continued, it was a bit of at that wave that we've now seen come into this year. But the growth based on backlog performance and new winds, we do expect to continue into next year and its better see another year of healthy growth in 2024.
David Keffer: And the other point I'd add is to your point David around the segment level view. We do expect the growth to be more balanced going forward with opportunities for growth in each of the four sectors as we demonstrated in this period in Q2. We see the growth in our defense systems business having recovered really nicely over the last couple of quarters. There were continued opportunities really across all four of the segments to drive growth.
David Strauss: Great. A quick follow-up on the F-18. How big is that still for you today and when would you expect that to completely run off?
David Keffer: Sure. Consistent with the commentary from our prime on the program, we do anticipate that production will wind down over the next couple of years. And for us it's 1% or less of sales and therefore not too dramatically impactful to the overall company topline. It's incorporated into our thinking about opportunities for growth in sales that AES over the next couple of years as are the other moving pieces we talked about throughout the call today.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Jason Gursky with Citigroup. You may proceed.
Jason Gursky: Yes, and good morning everybody. Audio has been a little choppy this morning. So, I apologize if you've already commented on this. But the comments you made early in your prepared remarks Kathy about the backlog of which you had at the end of '21 and where you are going to sit as you exit this year with having delivered about 70% of that backlog. I'm just kind of curious the remaining 30% that is still in front of you, what how big is the B-21 program in the remainder of that 30% which you've got still going on?
Kathy Warden: So, the remainder of backlog on B-21 is relatively small because what's in backlog is the EMD program completion. Production has yet to be awarded, so the lots we've been talking about is how to get to the first slot of production and contract later this year. But of course, it is priced and so that is a contractual commitment, but we have not yet been awarded it, so it's not showing up in backlog. Programs that are a significant amount of that backlog, our program like Sentinel, a sizable program that was awarded in 2020 or 2021 and is going to carry forward for several more years as part of that EMD program and backlog. And there are several others, but none that rise to that level. But I will remind you that Sentinel program is a cost plus program.
David Keffer: Right. So to that point, among the fixed price programs, where we talked about the 70% of that 2021 backlog having been transitioned into sales by the end of this year, there are no huge individual drivers of the remainder of -- the remaining 30%, if you will, and that will gradually translate into sales over the next few years. So a gradual wind down of the remaining 30%, based on the metrics we described earlier.
Jason Gursky: Okay, right. And then I'm sorry to beat a dead horse here on the space margins. But I did find your comment, Kathy, interesting about the potential for the business to operate above 10%, I think you said you want to drive it to 10. But there'll be opportunities for it potentially to go above that metric at some point in the future. I'm just kind of curious as to whether that is a comment for the broad portfolio of your space programs because when I historically think of spacecraft and space based assets, I tend to think of lower margin rates for that kind of work historically because it's been a lot of cost plus kind of work. So I'm wondering if this is a comment about the broad portfolio and would include assets that are going to be operating up in space? And is that comment -- if that is true, is it because you've got more fixed price work going on there than has historically been the case?
Kathy Warden: Yes, so as you think about the transition that the space market has undergone to where we had few large and exquisite assets, those were largely developed under cost plus and then transition to production but in low quantity, now we're seeing much less dollars go into development, and then a transition into production of higher quantity. So that mix will be different in terms of development versus production in the market as a whole. In addition, when you think about our portfolio and what's in our space segment, it includes things like solid rocket motors, particularly large solid rocket motors, it includes programs like Sentinel that will transition into production, and programs like [indiscernible] that we've talked about so as those transitions happen again, specifically now to our portfolio, not just the market in general for space, we've seen mix shift that will be tailwinds to margin over time.
Todd Ernst: Josh, we have time for one more question.
Operator:
[:
Unidentified Analyst: Hey, good morning. Kathy, just sticking with that a little bit and tying this to the prime versus merchant supplier discussion we had in the beginning on aeronautics, when you think about the shift, at least in satellites from GEOs to MEOs and LEOs when these highly proliferated constellations, and the significant to the SDA in that part of the market and their desire for fixed price contracts, is it better, at least in that kind of work to be on the supplier side at some point would you consider that?
Kathy Warden: We consider it with each opportunity, just as I discussed in Alpha process around military aircraft, we don't have a blanket, we will do this and we won't do that we think about each opportunity in terms of its risk profile. The maturity of our designs and offerings at the time that we're being asked to bid also weighs heavily into our thinking about that decision. And so in the case of the Space Development Agency, we are executing on several programs for them today and performing quite well. So we have chosen wisely and been disciplined in how we have taken on that work and will continue to do that. The beauty of our portfolio, as we've talked about before, is we can choose to prime. But if we don't see the right mix of risk reward we can also choose to be a supplier and still bring the capability forward that the government needs and expects from us.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you.
Kathy Warden: Great. Well, I think that's about all we have time for. So thank you to each of you for joining our call today. I also again want to extend my appreciation to the Northrop Grumman team for their continued strong performance and contribution to global security. I hope that all of you enjoy the remainder of your summer and I look forward to seeing you throughout the summer and talking to you again in October. Take care.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-04-27 12:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to Northrop Grumman's First Quarter Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. My name is Lisa, and I will be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Todd Ernst, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Ernst, please proceed.
Todd Ernst: Thanks, Lisa. Good morning, everyone and welcome to Northrop Grumman's first quarter 2023 conference call. We'll refer to a PowerPoint presentation that is posted on our IR web page this morning. Before we start, matters discussed on today's call, including guidance and outlooks for 2023 and beyond, reflect the company's judgment based on information available at the time of this call. They constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to safe harbor provisions of federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, including those noted in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties may cause actual company results to differ materially. Today's call will include non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to our GAAP results in our earnings release. On the call today are Kathy Warden, our Chair, CEO and President; and Dave Keffer, our CFO. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kathy. Kathy?
Kathy Warden: Thanks, Todd. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. Northrop Grumman is off to a solid start to the year. Our team is driving industry-leading growth by executing our strategy, meeting the growing global demand from our customers and performing on our programs. As a result, we increased sales by 6% and delivered strong earnings per share in the quarter. Additionally, we're delivering on our capital deployment strategy which prioritizes investing in our business and returning cash to shareholders. In the first quarter, we continued thoughtful investments in the capability and capacity needed to support our customers' operational initiatives and we initiated a $500 million accelerated share repurchase plan, returning a total of nearly $1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Based on first quarter results and our continued expectations for growth and strong operational performance, we're reaffirming our 2023 segment guidance. We're increasing our EPS guidance based on our continued confidence in our business outlook and to account for the divestiture of a small minority investment signed this week and expected to close this year. As we look to the long term, increasing breadth to freedom and security persist around the world. Given this, we expect continued support in Congress and the administration for the priorities outlined in the National Defense strategy which align well with the Northrop Grumman portfolio solution. This support was reaffirmed in the administration's budget request which was released in March. DoD investment accounts are up by nearly 4% for fiscal year 2024. Northrop Grumman programs continued to be well supported in the budget request, particularly in the areas of strategic deterrence, space, missile defense and advanced computing and communication technologies. The 2024 budget request also reflects the growing need for weapons capability and capacity, with overall funding increasing more than 20% compared to fiscal year 2023 and significant funding increases to major weapon programs, including many of which we provide key components. Two of our franchise programs, GBSD and B-21, each fall total investment account funding increased by approximately 10%. The future year defense plan or also prioritizes these programs, with funding projected to nearly double from about $8 billion in fiscal year 2023 to $15 billion in 2028. Outside the U.S., the geopolitical landscape remains dynamic. Global defense budgets are increasing as many U.S. outlies modernize and expand their defense capabilities. An important part of our long-term growth strategy is focused on leveraging our portfolio to meet these growing global needs and we continue to make progress in this area. In February, Australia issued a request for AARGM-ER, a high-speed, long-range air-to-ground missile that provides counter air defense capability. Northrop Grumman is a prime contractor for AARGM-ER. And this recent FMS request has a potential value of over $500 million. Australia is one of over a half dozen additional countries expressing interest in this capability. In addition, last month, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency approved the sale of 5 additional E-2D Hawkeye aircraft to Japan. These aircraft, along with the existing backlog, are expected to extend E-2D production well past mid-decade. These international opportunities, together with a broad set of others in IBCS, munitions and sensors, form a strong foundation to grow our international revenue at a double-digit rate over the next several years. With this global demand signal as a backdrop, we've been executing a strategy over the past few years to significantly enhance capabilities and capacity in our weapons portfolio. This portfolio includes components such as electronics, propulsion systems, warheads, infuses as well as missiles, armaments and interceptors. And as a result, we have multiple positions on key programs as both a supplier and a prime contractor. Let me share a few examples of progress we've made on this strategy. In the first quarter, we received awards for nearly $350 million for medium- and large-caliber ammunition, Bushmaster cannon and propulsion products for the guided multiple launch rocket system, or GMLRS. In addition, we're developing smarter, more advanced weapons required for future high-end fight with innovations in next-generation strike weapons, high-speed propulsion and smart ammunition. One example of this advancement is the Air Force's Stand-in Attack Weapon, also known as SiAW, a high-speed longer-range air-to-ground missile. During the first quarter, we received an award that takes us to the next phase of this competitive program. To meet our customers' growing demand in this area, we have invested nearly $1 billion since acquiring Orbital ATK, building our capacity for weapons and missile components. Our investments significantly increased capacity to produce solid rocket motors supporting our expectation for continued demand for this capability as well as increased capacity for GEM 63 boosters which supports the growing launch needs of our civil and commercial customers. We're also investing to increase capacity in our missile integration facility located at the Allegheny Ballistics Laboratory in West Virginia. Our newest 113,000 square foot facility is a factory of the future. It is designed to support production of up to 600 strike missiles per year. Production operations will commence with the second lot of low rate initial production for AARGM-ER, adding to other programs that we currently support this complex, including GMLRS Hellfire and Precision Strike Missile, among several others. In addition, we're building a new hypersonic center of excellence in Elkton, Maryland. Later to open this summer, this new production facility is designed to provide full life cycle production for hypersonic weapons from design and development to production and integration using the latest digital engineering and smart manufacturing technologies. The Elkton facility supports programs like hypersonic attack cruise missile, known as and Air launched powered hypersonic weapon that we're producing in partnership with Raytheon Technologies. We're not only a provider of missile systems, we also are a leading provider of missile defense system. This is a rapidly growing area within our business and includes a diverse set of franchise programs. Our work in missile defense is now approaching 10% of company revenue and we see an opportunity to expand that in the years ahead. Our broad end-to-end missile defense portfolio includes sensors, interceptors and command and control systems. One example is our prime contractor role on the next-generation Overhead Persistent Infrared, or OPIR Polar segment. This OPIR satellite constellation will operate at a highly elliptical orbit and provide critical strategic missile defense warning capabilities. Importantly, we also provide proliferated low earth orbit missile defense capabilities on programs like HBTSS and recent awards for SDA tracking Tranche 1. In addition, we're a prime integrator on next-generation INTERCEPT capabilities, including NGI and glide phase Interceptor. They protect against advanced ballistic and hypersonic missile threats. Shortly after the close of the quarter, we received approval for full rate production for IBCS, an integrated air and missile defense system. This key milestone allows the U.S. Army to set the fielding schedule for IBCS to its Air Defense unit which will significantly bolster regional defense capabilities. Over the fighter period, domestic deliveries of IBCS units are expected to increase by 40%. And as a reminder, Poland selected IBCS to serve as the centerpiece of its air and missile defense modernization and a number of other allies are also evaluating the system. Before turning the call over to Dave, I'd like to touch on a couple of key program updates, starting with B-21. The program remains on the government's baseline for cost and schedule and we're continuing to work towards first flight which will be informed by events and data and remains on track for this year. There are no material changes in our EACs this quarter for the EMD phases of the program and we continue to expect to receive the first LRIP award later this year. The B-21 program is expected to be the centerpiece of the Air Force's long-range strike portfolio for decades to come. With steady growth in the projected funding across the site, as I outlined and strong customer demand for its unmatched range, health and survivability, the long-term outlook for the B-21 program remains robust. On GBSD, we achieved 2 key milestones in the quarter. This includes its first full-scale static test fire of the Stage 1 followed rocket motor and the successful completion of a series of wind tunnel tests which tested the system in both subsonic and hypersonic environments. The comprehensive test campaign validated our digital modeling and simulations and improved design maturity of the missile. And earlier this month, the James Web-based telescope industry team led by Northrop Grumman won the prestigious trophy for revolutionizing the field of Aster physics. I want to congratulate the team for a pioneering design and unwavering commitment which were instrumental in winning our industry's highest honor. Overall, our strong start to the year is a clear indicator of this team's performance. We see continued robust demand for our solutions in the U.S. and abroad and we believe we're well positioned to maintain our industry-leading profitable growth and deliver value creation for shareholders and customers alike. With that said, I'll hand the call over to Dave to cover the details of our financial results and our outlook. Dave?
David Keffer: Okay. Thanks, Kathy and good morning, everyone. As Kathy noted, our first quarter results provide further evidence that our strategy is working. The strategic investments that we're making in franchise programs and key customer priority areas have positioned us to deliver differentiated growth. Our team continues to do an outstanding job of managing through challenges in the macroeconomic environment. We added substantially to our headcount again this quarter. With respect to the supply chain, we saw signs of modest progress in Q1. We continue to believe that our supply base will experience areas of pressure for some time. And inflation levels have begun to moderate but continue to have a higher base effect on our costs over time, especially on longer-term programs. As we've discussed on prior earnings calls, we've been experiencing impacts from inflation-related cost increases over the past year. We continue to drive efficiencies in our business and partner with our customers in an effort to reduce those impacts going forward. Now turning to Q1 results. Bookings of roughly $8 billion, were in line with our expectations, including $3.2 billion in restricted awards. Our backlog remains solid at more than 2x our annual sales, including nearly $24 billion in restricted backlog. At the segment level, our Q1 sales were particularly strong at Space Systems which grew 17% year-over-year. Aeronautics sales were slightly below the projected full year run rate, primarily due to timing of volume on a few of our large programs. MS was up 3% in the quarter, driven by expansion in restricted sales in the Networked Information Solutions business. And Defense Systems sales were up 7%. It's Battle Management and Missile Systems business, several components of which Kathy described earlier, is experiencing particularly strong customer demand, given the global threat environment. Segment margins were 10.8% in Q1, in line with our expectations and included roughly 50 basis points of unfavorable impact associated with higher CAS pension costs that were incorporated into our rates in Q1. Those impacts were spread relatively evenly across the 4 segments. AS margins were down from the first quarter of 2022, primarily because of the $67 million favorable EAC change on the B-21 EMD phase last year. GS margins were about in line with our full year outlook adjusting for the CAS pension impacts. MS was slightly under its 2023 projection, due in part to a loss recognized on an unconsolidated joint venture. And Space margins were solid in the quarter with lower EAC adjustments partially offset by the sale of a license to a customer. At the enterprise level, we generated sales volume of $9.3 billion, representing growth of 6% compared to the first quarter of 2022. Consistent with what we communicated last quarter, our Q1 sales were just over 24% of the midpoint of our full year estimate and were driven by both our hiring trends and supplier deliveries. Our first quarter operating income also grew 6%, due to lower corporate unallocated expense and intangible asset amortization. Our diluted earnings per share were $5.50 and included a headwind of over $1 per share compared to the first quarter of 2022 from lower net pension income. This noncash pension headwind will continue to be a factor in our year-over-year EPS comparisons throughout 2023. And based on current estimates, we expect pension income to begin to increase next year. We also had a few Q1 benefits below the segment line that contributed to our earnings per share. First, our other corporate unallocated expenses were only $4 million. And while our forecast for corporate unallocated was already weighted toward the second half of the year, this created a timing benefit of roughly $0.10 per share in the quarter. Our marketable securities were favorable in the period and contributed roughly $0.10 to earnings. And our Q1 estimated tax rate of 15.6%, was lower than our full year forecast, contributing another $0.10 of upside. This was due in part to the benefits of various tax credits recognized in the quarter. Altogether, these items contributed approximately $0.30 of benefit to our Q1 EPS but they are primarily timing related in nature. Turning to cash. As is our typical pattern, we experienced an outflow of cash in the first quarter, due primarily to working capital timing. Capital expenditures totaled $309 million and our first quarter operating cash flow was a usage of approximately $700 million, consistent with historical trends. Q2 last year was a period of cash outflow also but we're currently forecasting a modest inflow in Q2 this year. In April, we made our first cash tax payment of the year, including the R&D taxes owed associated with Section 174. For the full year, we're projecting over $700 million in cash taxes associated with Section 174 and we continue to be hopeful that Congress will find a way to amend or repeal the law. Moving to guidance. Given that the first quarter was roughly in line with our expectations, we have not changed any of our full year segment guidance ranges. We continue to project a book-to-bill ratio just under 1.0x for the year. We expect our second quarter sales to be in line with or slightly higher than Q1 and less than 25% of our full year estimate. We expect many of the timing items I mentioned previously to normalize over the course of the year, including interest expense. With respect to capital deployment, we remain committed to returning more than 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders this year via dividends and share repurchases. As Kathy mentioned, we initiated a $500 million accelerated share repurchase in the first quarter. And including our open market repurchases, we'll repurchase roughly $720 million of stock in the period. We also raised $2 billion in new notes in the first quarter at attractive rates which we anticipate using in part to retire the $1 billion of notes that are maturing in Q3. Over the long term, we've demonstrated our ability to generate strong and stable cash flows in our underlying business. And based on the durable growth in several areas of our business that Kathy highlighted, we continue to expect our free cash flow to expand at a robust rate, not just through 2025 but through the second half of the decade as well, providing flexibility for our long-term capital deployment plans. And as we noted in our 10-Q this morning, we just signed an agreement to sell our minority equity investment in a small international business. Closing is expected to occur later this year, most likely in Q3, subject to government approvals and closing conditions. We have increased our EPS guidance by $0.40, consistent with our estimated gain from the transaction and additive to our strong business outlook. In conclusion, we're pleased with our start to the year, certain improvements in the macro environment and robust demand signals from our customers domestically and abroad. And with that, let's open up the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Doug Harned of Bernstein.
Douglas Harned: I'd like to go back kind of to last quarter on the B-21. And the reason is, in the last quarter, you all raised the possibility that you could see the first 5 LRIPs not be profitable in a sense because of inflation. And one of my question is that presumably, when you originally won the contract back in 2015, you made inflation assumptions in the pricing that I would assume maybe LRIPs profitable. And since that time, we've seen mostly low inflation years with a couple of recent high inflation years just recently here. And first, how has inflation progressed relative to your original assumptions over that 8-year period? And is there an inflation level we should watch for going forward, where those costs become the issue that you were concerned about? Just trying to really see what the assumptions you're making are and how we should think about ultimate profitability here?
Kathy Warden: Yes, Doug, thanks for the question. So to talk about the assumptions that we made then on inflation and even that we're making now, I would look to publicly available information. We tend to use indices to think about long-term projections on macroeconomic condition. So if you roll the clock back to 2015 and look at what the Fed was doing, they were managing inflation to a 2% target and doing that pretty effectively. So you can imagine that that's the set of assumptions that we would have been relying on as we looked out into the future. I'm not saying that's exactly what we did. We're not going to disclose that but those indices give you a good sense of what we would have been thinking. Of course, the last couple of years, inflation has been higher than that. And the thing about inflation, particularly as it relates to labor, is it doesn't tend to come back down on labor once salaries are elevated, they tend to set a new labor benchmark. And so as we think about the future, we're expecting those costs at least to remain elevated over the remainder of the execution of the contract. In areas like materials and other supplies, we do believe those will follow the indices associated with those commodities. And so there will be some variation of what we can buy those materials out into the future and the indices are a good way to think about that as well.
Douglas Harned: And so when you go forward to finalize each of these LRIPs which is coming soon, I guess two things. I mean, is there -- is it possible to think -- for us to think of inflation levels that could be of a concern? But then also shouldn't you have the opportunity at least on labor and materials to get some sort of an equitable adjustment on cost?
Kathy Warden: Well, we certainly believe so. And as I noted in our last call, that is what we're working toward. And so we continue to have discussions with the government, both congressionally with the dollars that they have appropriated for inflation relief for contracts just like this and the Department of Defense as they think about how to allocate those funds and we'll continue to work that very actively. And of course, wouldn't expect that relief to come all at once but in the annual appropriations associated with the program or a separate funds like we saw in 2023 for inflation relief. Now with that said, we also are working to offset these increases with other elements inside of our control, our overhead rates, the other costs that flow into segment operating margin that can have a beneficial effect as well. We're not relying fully on actions the government will take, although we do believe that both the government and Northrop Grumman should be working to mitigate these impacts and share this risk together.
Operator: Our next question will be coming from Seth Seifman of JPMorgan.
Seth Seifman: I wonder if you could talk a little bit about Aeronautics and kind of other than restricted programs. I assume B-21, we saw a number of declines in the quarter. And that's not very surprising. Those are kind of mature programs. But where do you see, excluding B-21, where we have the budget documents, when do you see the rest of the Aeronautics portfolio sort of stabilizing? And then, if you could talk about the potential for any other growth drivers in the portfolio, especially potentially in the Autonomous area over time and how you're thinking about aligning with the Air Force's strategy there?
Kathy Warden: Well, thanks, Seth. We have talked about the long-term view of Aero top line. And so while not guiding for 2024, we have said that we do expect revenue to be flattish this year and then begin to grow again next. And that's driven by a few factors. The first is those programs you noted and that we noted in the Q, like Joint Stars, Global Hawk that have been putting pressure on our year-over-year comparison, Aero do become minimal from this point forward in terms of year-over-year sales decline. We also have programs that are fairly stable, like F-35, that will continue. And then we have growth drivers like B-21. And in addition to that, I would add the Air Force's operational imperatives as well as some new program activity that's happening for the Navy and Aviation as well. So all of those create modest but some upside for us as we look in the compares '24 to '23.
Seth Seifman: Great. I guess if I could sneak in one more. You talked a lot about the investments that you're making in your prepared remarks and I thought that was very helpful. And I kind of plays into this idea that we're in sort of a different world where the customer needs kind of more spare capacity. How do you think about return on investment in that world where maybe there's a need for more spare capacity? And is there a willingness on the customer side to kind of recognize that and provide some value for it as well?
Kathy Warden: Yes. Excellent question as well. So as we're thinking about the investments we're making, we look at what we believe a stable long-term capacity level is that will be supported by government expenditures. And we've made those investments. We got ahead of that curve because we believe that we can gain share by being ready for that demand signal as it comes. But then we look out and say there is likely to be a period of surge that the government would like industry to respond to. And there, we've put proposals forward to the government to get their funding to support what would be that additional capacity. So in the example that I gave today, I talked about us investing nearly $1 billion of our own dollars in expanding solid rocket motors, both for tactical missiles which was really the focus of my commentary today but all the way to strategic missiles as well. We're expanding capacity in those areas. We have more than doubled the capacity with the investments we've laid in or plan to make. For the government to go even further than that, we are suggesting that we can support that but would look for government funding to complement it.
Operator: Our next question will come from Sheila Kahyaoglu of Jefferies.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Kathy, you mentioned GBSD and B-21 funding nearly doubling through the bid up. How do we think about this relative to your plan as it relates to Northrop's revenues versus some of the money, obviously, going to suppliers or the government? And you also mentioned free cash flow growth beyond the current target. How do we think these programs contribute to that growth?
Kathy Warden: So as we look at the profile on large programs like B-21 and Sentinel. You are right point out that all of that doesn't come to Northrop Grumman and our suppliers. Some of that is government funding. And that's particularly true with the Sentinel program because there is a significant of government activities associated with the work that will go on in the missile field and the coordination and collaboration across government to enable the construction scope. So when we look at our profile on these programs, it is a subset of the overall budget growth but it tends to follow in terms of relative year-over-year growth. What we will experience, not necessarily in that year because those appropriated funds or for what will be extended, it then takes us time to extend those funds, sometimes 18 to 24 months depending on the scope of work kind of program like B-21 and Sentinel. So when you net all of what I just said, the signal from the budget tells you there is continued and sustained growth in both of those programs through the that, that growth will come and be sustained not just through that 2028 period if you could expect it to continue, both when you look at what the government has said about quantities on B-21 and how they ramp as well as Sentinel moving into production in that time frame and still be ramping. So it's not just about '24 to '28 projections that you see in the Fidelis but looking beyond that into the next decade.
David Keffer: Sheila, one thing I'd add to the second point you raised around free cash flow growth, what we were touching on there is really beyond the 3-year outlook period that we've provided with specifics. The second half of the decade provides an opportunity for continued free cash flow growth and that's driven by returns on some of the investments Kathy has been describing throughout this call. It will be a period of less heavy capital intensity and more in the way of opportunity for returns on those investments we have been and are currently making. And then, of course, some of the less operational items like cash taxes will be lower in the second half of the decade as we get through the Section 174 amortization period. And the opportunity exists for CAS pension recoveries to continue to be higher in that second half of the decade. So all told, that's what gives us optimism about that period from a free cash flow expansion perspective also.
Operator: The next question will be coming from Ronald Epstein of Bank of America.
Ronald Epstein: Maybe changing gears just a little bit. Kathy, can you talk a bit about -- and you mentioned it a little bit in your opening remarks about Northrop's strategy in the space market. One of the big things that we learned out as the space imposing, the whole architecture of space is changing. You guys had a huge presence there and there's some pretty interesting stuff going on with your partnership with Firefly and so on and so forth. But if you could just kind of walk us through your vision on Northrop in space, defense and commercial?
Kathy Warden: Yes, certainly. So you're right to point out that our strategy in space is broad-based. The cornerstone of it is as the cornerstone of our business tied to national security and supporting the U.S. and our allies to operate effectively and freely in space. But we also have a strategic significant pillar in space exploration as evidenced in our work in James Webb and more scientific missions but also our work in the Artemis program in space exploration. And our commercial ventures are largely tied to enabling those two strategic pillars within our space business. So when we are looking at the technologies that we need in space, we are well integrated across all elements of a solution, meaning we think about launch, even if we're not the launch provider, having partnerships with companies that can provide us the ability to launch. And that's the relationship we have with Firefly, being able to build the satellites that provide value and that's both being a bus provider as well as the payload, then being able to operate, command and control those assets in space. So that's more of a JADC2 contribution with the space domain in mind. And then, of course, that means being able to operate on the ground as well as be able to have these satellites able to communicate and share data. So this ties to the core competencies we have across this company in other domains and we are working to bring all of that to the space domain. And the space domain is the fastest growing area, not only of our business but our customers' budget, both NASA and the Department of Defense has been very well supported in recent budgets and we expect that to continue. So our objective is to use this opportunity to continue to grow our share and our relevance in those markets.
Ronald Epstein: And then, if I may ask just a quick follow-on to that. When you think about the growth in that business, it's been a huge growth driver for you. Do you foresee that continuing into the next couple of years? I mean, how should we think about the growth of that business?
Kathy Warden: I do. And I've said that we shouldn't get wedded to double-digit growth that we've been experiencing consistently for the last several years because we have been in a position of winning significant new programs and seeing those programs ramp. And the business itself has nearly doubled. It's pretty amazing to see what's happened in the last few years. So I don't expect that to be the growth profile for the next several years but I do expect it to continue to be a growth engine in our company. And as we just talked about programs like Sentinel, the most significant growth on some of these is yet to come because many of the programs are in the development phase, where we are just building the first of. The opportunity is when those transition into production for both higher volumes and higher margins. And that's still very much ahead of us.
Operator: The next question will be coming from Robert Spingarn of Melius.
Robert Spingarn: So Kathy, just a follow-up on Ron's question on space. SpaceX announced a separate division called Star Shield that's going to be focused on defense work. How do you think about their push into national security? And is there an opportunity actually to partner with them? So is it more of a positive potentially or negative?
Kathy Warden: I don't see it as a significant change. We have been partnering with SpaceX. We expect to continue to do so. And my sense is that standing up this into within SpaceX, it's more to help them with the structural differences in dealing with the government work and customers versus their commercial aspirations. But in terms of our ability to work together, they've been a good partner to us. Of course, they're also a competitor but that's normal in our space and so we expect that to continue. And we embrace competition in Northrop Grumman. We think it hones our skills makes us stronger. And so we see this as a positive for the industry overall.
Operator: The next question will be coming from Jason Gursky of Citi.
Jason Gursky: Kathy, you did a nice job of outlining some of the recent wins and developments and investments that you're making. You touched a little bit about Aeronautics and Space growth in the out years. So I wonder if you might do the same for Defense and the Mission Systems kind of focusing in not just on the positives but any potential headwinds that you see there, so we can all kind of get a good sense of what out your growth rates in '24 and '25 might look like?
Kathy Warden: Yes. So why don't I start with Mission Systems. It's been a steady grower. We anticipate that it will continue to be. It hasn't been our fastest grower but it's just really consistent. And I expect that to be the position Mission Systems finds itself and going forward. And that's not to say there aren't a lot of changes happening within that business. It is a highly competitive business and one where technical differentiation is critical but they are staying at the forefront of technology to remain competitive. So, some examples of that are as aircraft of the fourth gen are retired eventually, they have roles -- significant roles on some of those. And so that work starts to dissipate. But at the same time, they are competing for next-generation technologies. And you see this even playing out on the F-35, where we talked about the new radar development award that we got is that platform is being modernized with Block IV upgrades. And so I'm really pleased with that team's competitive position stay at the forefront of technology and continue to win new work but that will be necessary for them to continue this mid-single-digit growth rate that we've got become accustomed to there. In terms of Defense, it's a little bit of a different story. There, we have been a flattish business and that has been because we weren't seeing significant growth in weapons. It was a pretty stable business and we were seeing the work in our aircraft modernization decline. What I expect to see going forward is that our weapons portfolio growth more than offset the declines in the other part of the portfolio and it will be a net grower for us. How much is dependent on how quickly that global demand that I talked about in today's call matures and also how successful we are in winning work on both new weapons development programs as well as second source on some existing programs. And I'm optimistic there. But this year will be really pivotal in indicating what we think the growth for that business will be. But we do see it being a growth business next year.
Operator: The next question will be coming from Kristine Liwag Morgan Stanley.
Kristine Liwag: With the debt ceiling standoff, there's been a lot of discussion of an extended CR in fiscal year '24 which tend to have more of a disruptive impact on programs that are ramping or transitioning. You've previously mentioned that you expect the first B-21 LRIP contract later this year as it transitions from development. But if the program award date slips past the end of September and into fiscal year '24, what could that mean for the program?
Kathy Warden: For the B-21, because those funds were appropriated as part of FY '23, we don't believe that there will be an issue with them awarding that production lot. And as you look across our portfolio, we are used to navigating CRs. And so there aren't any major issues that I would point out to you if this is a short-term CR. But as the industry always points out, the longer a CR goes, the more those risks become material. I'm hopeful that, given the threat environment that Congress recognizes the importance of timely appropriations, I'm not saying we won't have a CR but I am hopeful that it won't be an extended period CR. But if indeed that's the case, we'll work with the government to address any issues that we see on individual and material program.
Operator: The next question comes from Myles Walton of Wolfe.
Myles Walton: Dave, I wonder if you could first size the loss of the JV and the favorable license in relative terms or absolute terms you like? And then maybe, Kathy, at a high level, I think this is the high watermark thus far for cost-plus mix, 54% in the quarter since the Orbital acquisition was done. And I'm curious if it keeps going higher from here or this truly is a high watermark?
David Keffer: Well, why don't I start on the first and then I'll hand it over to Kathy. On your first question, we talked on the call about last year's $67 million EAC benefit on the B-21 EMD program in this quarter. When things get to that level of magnitude, well into the tens of millions, we tend to disclose and describe and quantify those in more detail. When we have things in the $10 million and $20 million [ph], as we do every quarter, as you'd imagine a business of our size, we tend to group those together and describe them as we have in this case, the benefit of the license sale and the downside from the JV. So, you can expect things like that to have been in that much lower range but still meaningful in terms of thinking through run rates and full year impacts.
Kathy Warden: And Myles, I'll just add on to that before I answer your second question that if you look at our margins coming out of the gate for the year right where we wanted to be in segment operating margin adjusted for the pension impact which we've been talking about, hitting the programs in the first quarter. So we're not breaking that down by segment. If you took each of our 4 businesses and then accounted for those 2 minor exceptions which you just outlined and adjusted for pension, they be right in line with our guidance for the year. So we're not going to walk you through the exact math of each item that goes into that, that we can tell you that those segments all 4 are in the first quarter with those impacts we've outlined adjusted for right in line with where they need to be to deliver on their guidance. In answer to your second question, I do believe the quarter is a bit of a high watermark on our mix because we had some fluctuations just in production quantities within particularly MS that drove their mix balance higher on cost plus. We don't even expect that to sustain for the full year within MS. So we're going to probably end the year a little over the 50% cost plus which is where we had signaled we would likely be and that's still where we think we are. And we don't see a major shift in that for the next couple of years until, as we've said, these programs that are in development start to move into production, especially the bigger ones like B-21, Sentinel and some of the space programs, then you'll see a more material mix shift for us but it will be towards fixed price.
Operator: The next question will be coming from Cai von Rumohr of Cowen.
Cai Von Rumohr: Terrific. So Kathy, you mentioned that book-to-bill expected to be a little bit under 1x this year. But lots of times, key wins have small bookings to start off. So could you give us some color in terms of what are the key competitions or booking opportunities you see over the rest of the year? And what are the milestones we should look for?
Kathy Warden: Yes. So it's a very intuitive question. As we look at 2023, there are not many competitive new awards or even down select. As I've talked about, we have a good bit of work in our portfolio where we are in a usually 2-horse race programs like NGI is a good example of that. But we don't see many of those this year. They become more substantive in '24 and even '25. And -- so we'll provide more color on those as we guide for '24 later this year. What I'll tell you about 2023 is that the majority of our sales this year are in backlog and we don't see much in the way of competitive new awards. It's really immaterial for us this year.
Operator: The next question is from Robert Stallard of Vertical.
Robert Stallard: Kathy, one for you. The Australian government put out a defense strategy report, I think it was earlier this week. And in there, they seem to be contemplated whether they thought they might buy the B-21 which is a bit of a surprise to me at least. I was wondering this might be a sign that the U.S. government is a little bit more open to the U.S. defense industry exporting some of its more sophisticated equipment, including Northrop Grumman?
Kathy Warden: Yes, I'm glad you took the question the way you did. I was obviously expecting someone might ask, why didn't they buy it? And you're right on. It would be premature for the U.S. to be working with another government on the B-21 program. But I think it is important that there were discussions ongoing ones that if you would have told me a handful of years ago might happen, I would have been surprised to hear. So I think in particular and the opening of a strategic relationship on nuclear-powered submarines between the U.S., the U.K. and Australia is going to change how those 3 nations at least work together more collaboratively and I wouldn't take it off the table in the long run that other strategic capabilities become part of that dialogue. But with where the B-21 is today, I think it appropriate that they did not count on it in their defense strategic review.
Operator: The next question is coming from Ken Herbert of RBC.
Kenneth Herbert: Your acquisition of Orbital ATK, the timing in hindsight now seems to have been very good, just considering growth in Space and now what we're seeing in Missiles and Munitions. Within the broader sort of capital allocation context, are there other areas perhaps from an inorganic standpoint or acquisition standpoint that you think could fit in well with the portfolio? You obviously outlined a number of organic investments today. But how do you view acquisitions perhaps moving forward relative to the market opportunities? And at what point would you maybe look more favorably on inorganic growth?
Kathy Warden: We certainly remain active in looking at opportunities to expand through acquisition. I would say that on the breadth of our portfolio and the strength of it, there are no gaps that I see an imperative to use acquisitions to fill those gaps that we are positioned to do so largely through both organic investing and external partnering which is an important tool in our toolkit. It doesn't require acquiring companies to have those very strategic partnerships with them, one of which we talked about earlier in the call with Firefly, for instance. But with that said, the regulatory environment is certainly top of mind when I think about execution risk associated with acquisition as well. So we take all of that into consideration and likely wouldn't see a path to do a significant strategic acquisition in the near term.
Operator: The next question is coming from David Strauss of Barclays.
David Strauss: Kathy, you mentioned the updated funding profile for B-21 and Sentinel that were in the budget. Specifically, I wanted to ask about B-21. It looks like there was some shift there where development dollars were added and production dollars were shifted to the right. So if you could comment on what that reflects, first of all? And second of all, what that could mean for your margin profile in the program, given your strong performance during the development phase?
Kathy Warden: Yes, David. So you may recall, we had talked previously about our cost projections for the program were below independent cost estimates upon which the government needed to set their budget. You're starting to see that now reflected in the modifying those production budget. And you might see more of that in the future as we're hitting those cost targets that we have for the programs that are below their independent cost estimates. So that's what you see happening in production. The production funding they requested really supports the needs of the program as we and the government understand them today that is allowing them to ask Congress for more in the RDT&E accounts associated with modernization and beginning that modernization now. And I really want to complement the way the Air Force manage this programs. They are always thinking ahead and working with us on not just the current spaces we're executing but how we will execute the next phase of the program. So we have largely moved our way through EMD. Now we're starting production. We -- it's only natural that we would be looking at the modernization program and that's what you see reflected in their budgeting. And from a margin perspective, I know which is really where you want to go, yes, we do expect the margins on that work associated with modernization to be better than what we expect to get in LRIP production, so it will be a net positive to the overall B-21 margin picture.
Todd Ernst: We have time for one more question.
Operator: The next question and final question is coming from Peter Arment of Baird.
Peter Arment: Kathy, just circling back to kind of how you kicked off the call talking about kind of increased demand signals on Munitions and some of the Missile Defense capabilities like IBCS. Just when we think about international, how do you think a lot of this growth starts to layer in? Is it more '24, '25 or in beyond? Or do you see some of this growth actually showing up more to the left of that?
Kathy Warden: Yes. We see some of it starting to show up now. So I mentioned $350 million of awards that we received in the first quarter associated with weapons. And of course, IBCS, part of the Missile Defense portfolio, we are starting as that now has gotten full rate production approval to see that demand fill out not just here but with the Poland deliveries as well. So, some of that certainly is going to provide support to the Defense System sector in 2023. But we do see the majority of those opportunities later, '24, '25, as those programs scale. NGI is another good example where we have seen significant growth last year in this. We'll see somewhere into 2024 but the real opportunity there is after either a down select or a carry forward of 2 parties and moving into production in the later part of the decade. So thanks, everybody, for joining our call today. I also want to again extend my thanks and congratulations to our team for another solid quarter. We look forward to speaking with you all on our next earnings call in July. So Lisa, with that, we're concluding today's call.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's call. And you all may disconnect.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-01-26 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2022 Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. My name is Norma, and I'll be your operator today. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host today, Mr. Todd Ernst, Treasurer and Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Ernst, please proceed.
Todd Ernst: Thanks, Norma. Good morning, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's Fourth Quarter 2022 Conference Call. We refer to a PowerPoint presentation that is posted on our IR web page this morning. Before we start, matters discussed on today's call, including guidance and outlook for 2023 and beyond, reflect the company's judgment based on information available at the time of this call. They constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to safe harbor provisions of federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, including those noted in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties may cause actual company results to differ materially. Today's call includes non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to our GAAP results in our earnings release. On today's call are Kathy Warden, our Chair, CEO and President; and Dave Keffer, our CFO. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kathy. Kathy?
Kathy Warden: Thanks, Todd. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The Northrop Grumman team delivered another year of strong performance in 2022, positioning our company for the coming year and beyond. A growing global demand environment and the team's success in capitalizing on competitive opportunities drove exceptional bookings. Top line growth accelerated throughout the year, driven in part by improving labor trends. I'll note that we set our sales and EPS guidance ranges at the beginning of 2022, and even in a dynamic macro environment, we navigated the challenges to deliver at or above the high end of those ranges, and then importantly, to deliver capability for our customers. This performance highlights our solid operating execution, our ability to win new business and the alignment of Northrop Grumman's portfolio to our customers' priorities. We enter 2023 with a backlog of more than 2x our annual sales. This strong backlog, along with increasing demand and rising global defense budget supports our expectations for continued growth. Given this and supported by robust headcount growth, we have increased our 2023 sales guidance range from our October outlook. We are projecting solid segment margin performance that takes into consideration inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions, consistent with the expectations we outlined on the October call. And we expect a greater than 20% compound annual growth in our multiyear cash flow outlook that supports continued investments in the business and significant returns of capital to shareholders. Before providing more details on our outlook, I'm going to highlight a few notable achievements from the previous year that underscore the tenets of our long-term strategy and illustrate our positioning for the future. In 2022, the James Webb Space Telescope proved its status as the world's most powerful space telescope and an engineering marvel. It achieved full operational status, shared first images in July and continues to discover and inspire with its incredible insights into distinct galaxies. This project is just one example of the technology innovation and leadership our team brings to our customers. And it has provided an excellent platform for attracting talent to our industry and our company. In 2022, we continued to win new competitive awards across the company, achieving a book-to-bill ratio of 1.07. Two notable new awards are the space development agencies tracking and transport layers. As our customers look to expand their resilient national security space capabilities, these programs leverage our advanced space solutions for low earth orbit and showcase our ability to compete and win programs across a range of missions. We also completed over 40 successful launch and space missions in the year, exemplifying our end-to-end capabilities in the space market and our ability to perform at scale. Further, our solid rocket boosters helped propel NASA's base launch system as part of the Artemis 1 mission with the largest human-rated solid rocket boosters ever built. We also received a $2 billion award for GEM 63 solid rocket boosters in support of Amazon's Project Kuiper. Together, SLS and Kuiper validate the robust investments that we've made in solid rocket motor capabilities. We also delivered advanced architectures that integrate sensors to provide unprecedented situational awareness for our customers. One example is our IBCS solution. After successful testing in the fourth quarter, IBCS is poised to transition from LRIP to full-rate production in 2023. IBCS integrate systems that weren't designed to work together, creating a seamless air and missile defense network and allowing customers to better utilize their defense assets. This capability is needed more than ever to address advanced threats and it's one where we've seen a significant increase in interest across our global customer base with 10 additional countries expressing interest in obtaining this system. We continue to keep our focus on innovating and leveraging our strong position in advanced technology. This includes the development of a new radar for the F-35. This radar is capable of defeating current and projected adversarial air and surface threats and is compatible with variants of the F-35 aircraft. And we capped off a strong year with the historic unveiling of the B-21 Raider. The B-21 is a multifunctional platform with unmatched range, stealth and survivability, and it will be the backbone of future U.S. air power for decades to come. We continue to perform well on the program and remain on track for first flight later this year. As the program transitions into low rate initial production, we are working to address macroeconomic conditions, especially related to inflation and their impact on material, suppliers and labor. Importantly, I want to highlight that our B-21 unit cost projections remain below the government's independent cost estimates. The program has strong support from the U.S. Air Force, Congress and our suppliers. And in the words of Secretary Austin from last month's rollout, "This aircraft is proof of the department's commitment to building advanced capabilities that will fortify America's ability to deter aggression today, and in the future." Our 2022 achievements underscore the breadth of our portfolio across a wide range of domains and technologies and the strong performance of the entire Northrop Grumman team. As we look forward, defense budgets are on the rise, and we see our global customers continuing to seek proven solutions to address rapidly evolving and increasingly sophisticated threats. We are meeting their urgent needs in areas such as air and missile defense solutions, medium and large caliber ammunitions and armaments, advanced radar capabilities and global surveillance to name just a few. And we are partnering to expand our opportunity set and positioning our international business for future growth. We clearly saw increased demand in 2022, and we continue to expect to grow our international business over the next several years. In the U.S., we are encouraged by the continued strong support for National Security, including overwhelming bipartisan support for a 10% spending increase in the fiscal year 2023 defense budget that was passed in December. Our portfolio and the capabilities we offer are well supported by the administration and Congress. Growing security challenges will test our resolve in ways not seen for a generation, and we are confident this administration and the new Congress will find ways to work together to meet them. We expect the President's fiscal year 2024 budget request to support robust funding for the highest priority capabilities outlined in the National Defense Strategy. And our strategy has positioned us well. We're clearly maintaining our technology leadership and growing our portfolio of offerings, which is aligned to customer priorities. Another key element of our long-term strategy is keeping a laser focus on performance and driving cost efficiencies throughout the business. The current macroeconomic environment reinforces the importance of doing so. An example of our effort is the implementation of digital solutions across the company. Beyond the benefit of transforming how we design, test and manufacture the next generation of systems, our digital initiatives are streamlining business functions and increasing productivity. We are also optimizing our facilities and consolidating our real estate footprint. Every day, we seek new and innovative ways to drive performance and increased efficiency while remaining agile and meeting our customers' expectations. Our capital deployment strategy supports our business strategy. We are investing to not only drive efficiencies but also to allow our customers to stay ahead of the threat environment. In 2022, we invested over 7% of revenue in R&D and capital expenditures to provide the capability and capacity needed to address the threats of today and tomorrow. We also continue to return cash to shareholders. Last year, we increased our dividend by 10%, which was the 19th consecutive increase. And during the year, we delivered over $1 billion to shareholders through the dividend and returned another $1.5 billion through share repurchases. So looking forward to 2023, we are well positioned for continued growth, and our revenue outlook has improved from the high $37 billion range we shared in October. We now expect sales to be in the range of $38 billion to $38.4 billion, representing about 4.5% growth at the midpoint. Margins are expected to remain solid in the 11.3% to 11.5% range. We are projecting strong free cash flow growth that supports our capital deployment strategy. And we expect to return more than 100% of free cash flow to shareholders again in 2023. Our backlog, strong recent global demand growth and our ability to deliver products that address an increasingly complex security environment give us confidence in our outlook. So with that, I'll hand it over to Dave to cover the details of our financial results and more on guidance.
David Keffer: Okay. Thanks, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. I also want to thank our team for another year of strong performance in 2022. We won several new franchise programs, delivered industry-leading top line growth and bolstered our talented workforce, with the addition of over 6,000 net employees during the year. I'll spend a few minutes on our fourth quarter and 2022 results and then discuss our future expectations in more detail, including our long-term cash flow projections. We ended the year with nearly $79 billion in backlog, reflecting strong demand for our products and capabilities. We continue to convert our backlog into revenue at an accelerating rate with fourth quarter sales growth of 16%. This was enabled by our ability to continue strong hiring in Q4 as well as a higher volume of material receipts based on the timing of program demand. The team did an outstanding job of working with our supply chain to secure program material. And for the full year, our sales grew to $36.6 billion, representing organic growth of 3% and exceeding our prior expectations. Our operating performance and margins remained solid despite the continued pressures of the macroeconomic environment. Our segment operating margin rate was slightly below our expectations at 11.3% in Q4 and 11.6% for the full year due in part to the impacts of inflation, which resulted in a lower level of net earnings adjustments. But margin dollar volume was very strong given the top line outperformance. A positive EAC adjustment in the quarter was on B-21, where we recognized a $66 million pickup on the EMD phase of the program, reflecting our latest assumptions regarding future incentives in that phase. Continuing with our Q4 results. Our transaction adjusted earnings per share were $7.50, a 25% increase over the same period in 2021. Higher EPS were driven by robust growth in our segment top and bottom lines as well as a lower effective tax rate. The lower Q4 tax rate was driven by the recognition of an $86 million benefit from the resolution of a legacy Orbital ATK tax return, which we previewed in our guidance last quarter. And corporate unallocated costs were also below our expectations due to lower state taxes as a result of the R&D tax amortization law not being deferred. For the full year, our transaction-adjusted earnings per share were $25.54, well ahead of our guidance range. Now turning to cash. We had an extremely strong fourth quarter, consistent with our historical pattern. For the year, we generated $2.9 billion of operating cash flow and $1.6 billion of transaction-adjusted free cash flow, in line with our expectations. This was inclusive of a full year of cash taxes associated with the R&D tax amortization law as well as our final payment of deferred payroll taxes from the Cares Act legislation. Moving to our pension plans. Slide 7 in our earnings deck includes our latest assumptions. After 3 consecutive years of double-digit asset returns, our plans declined by roughly 15% in 2022, in line with market trends. Our FAS discount rate increased roughly 250 basis points to 5.54%, which was the driver of the mark-to-market pension benefit of $1.2 billion reflected in our GAAP results. These factors are also reflected in our latest pension estimates for 2023 to 2025. As we previewed last quarter and updated in our slides today, we're projecting a decline in our noncash net FAS pension income and an increase in our estimated CAS recoveries. In total, our pension plans remain strong. As a result of the higher discount rate, our funded status has improved to nearly 100%, and we continue to project minimal cash pension contributions over the next several years. Now turning to 2023 guidance. Our revenue expectations have increased from our prior estimates, with the midpoint representing nearly 4.5% growth on top of the strong level in 2022. We expect Space Systems to remain our fastest-growing business. Sales are projected in the mid-$13 billion range, up over $1 billion from 2022 levels, with GBSD and NGI contributing nearly half of the growth and the rest coming from our broad space portfolio. Mission Systems sales are expected in the high $10 billion range, up mid-single digits, driven by restricted programs in our Networked Information Solutions business. And we continue to expect flattish sales at both Aeronautics and Defense Systems. While programs like B-21 and IBCS continue to grow, headwinds remain on legacy platforms as systems are retired. We expect Aeronautics and Defense Systems to return to growth in 2024. And similar to our cadence in 2022, we expect first quarter sales of approximately 24% of our full year estimate, with sales ramping again throughout the year. With respect to margins, we expect our 2023 segment operating margin rate to be down roughly 20 basis points from 2022 levels. Challenging macroeconomic conditions, including extended lead times in the supply chain and high levels of inflation continue to put temporal pressure on margins. And while higher CAS recoveries provide a modest benefit to our cash flow in the coming years that create pressure in our overhead rates and EACs. Similar in nature to what we experienced in the first quarter of 2021 when we recognized a favorable impact from lower projected CAS costs, this could lead to an unfavorable margin impact when we update our rates this quarter. We notionally expect this to have a 10 to 20 basis point impact on the full year. In regard to the B-21 program, we expect the 2023 contract award for the first of 5 LRIP lots with the LRIP phase scheduled to run through approximately the end of the decade. We're continuing to work with our customer to address macroeconomic risks and enhance efficiencies in the program. As we've described in our 10-K, we do not believe that a loss on the LRIP phase is probable and therefore, no such loss is reflected in our results or guidance. Now turning to our future outlook. We expect our 2023 earnings per share to range between $21.85 and $22.45 based on approximately 153 million weighted shares outstanding. This includes $450 million of net pension income, which represents a $4.30 per share headwind compared to 2022. Partially offsetting this nonoperational headwind is strong growth in segment performance and the lower share count, which adds roughly $0.90 of additional earnings per share and lower purchase intangible amortization largely offsets the higher tax rate. Moving to cash. We expect 2023 adjusted free cash flow between $1.85 billion and $2.15 billion, consistent with our prior outlook as adjusted for current R&D tax law. Although we expect discussions to continue on Capitol Hill, our guidance and multiyear outlook are now based on current tax law for all years and do not include any refunds for R&D taxes paid in 2022. Capital expenditures are expected to remain elevated at $1.65 billion to $1.7 billion in 2023 and a similar level in 2024 before moderating in 2025 and beyond. This is driven by investments to support several large new business wins from 2022. Our guidance assumes we will not have an extended CR, a breach of the debt ceiling or a prolonged government shutdown as this is our current expectation. Slide 12 in our earnings deck provides our long-term cash outlook, which is predicated on continued top line growth in our business generating strong and gradually expanding operating margins and converting those margins into cash. R&D-related cash tax payments should decline by about 20% per year. As I described, CapEx is expected to remain near 4.5% of sales in 2023 and 2024 before starting to decline in 2025. After investing in our business, we continue to expect to return more than 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders in 2023 in the form of dividends and share repurchases. And we plan to be in the market for new debt issuance soon to support our capital deployment plans including the refinancing of near-term maturities. In summary, 2022 was another successful year for Northrop Grumman, and we continue to deliver value for our customers, employees and shareholders. And with that, we're ready to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley.
Kristine Liwag: Kathy, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that the B-21 cost estimated is below the government estimates. But as Dave mentioned, there are macro and inflation cost pressures. I mean this comment really stood out to me since in the past decade, we've seen many large defense development programs exceed costs and not just by a smidge but meaningfully. Can you provide more color on what the Northrop team is doing to manage this risk and how we should think about the LRIPs through the end of the decade? And what are puts and takes in terms of potential risk?
Kathy Warden: Yes. So as we noted, we are performing exceptionally well on the B-21 program, and we have continued government support for the quantities of at least 100 that are represented in the program of record. But given that this contract was initially awarded in 2015, the recent and really unprecedented macroeconomic impact of inflation, labor, supply chain disruption has affected the cost estimate to perform on the LRIP phase of the program. And importantly, we noted our projected cost per unit are still below the government cost estimates upon which the funding profile is based. And that's important because it supports the overall buy plan of the U.S. government. And just to, as a reminder on timing, the government hasn't yet exercised any of the LRIP options. So like we do on any price options, we continue to look at what the future may hold and reflect that in our estimates that complete, but those are indeed estimates of cost and future performance. So while -- as we note in the K , we don't currently consider a loss on LRIP to be probable, if it were ultimately to occur, it would spread over all 5 lots of the program. And particularly, that's important related to any cash flow impact. So as we look at 2023, we do not see that as material in our cash flow outlook. And even as we put together our 3-year cash flow outlook, we wouldn't see that as being material. So hopefully, that gives you a sense of what is contributing to B-21 cost estimates. Inflation clearly is the primary driver there. as we think about what's changed recently in our estimates, and we are working to mitigate those impacts, as you say, and we have some time as we move forward and get into production to continue to do that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ronald Epstein with Bank of America.
Ronald Epstein: Maybe my first question is on space. The performance there is better than I think anybody was anticipating. What's underlying that? And how should we think about that going forward maybe even beyond 2023?
Kathy Warden: Yes, Ron, you are stating it accurately the performance there has been better even than we expected, and it's largely driven by more success in competitive wins than we had anticipated. Generally in all of our business, we project a certain amount of success, particularly in competitive environment. And here, we've just done better than we anticipated. And so that's driven sales upside and the very strong book-to-bill that we've had in that business where their backlog now is more than 3x sales and supports our projections for long-term, steady and durable growth.
Ronald Epstein: And then you mentioned in your -- just as a follow-on in your prepared remarks that your growth has been supported by your ability to hire folks. How has that been -- I know, I mean, it's kind of across the entire industry and your supply chains, getting labor has been difficult, particularly skilled labor that's kind of up to spec. How have you guys been able to do that? And what's underlying that?
Kathy Warden: It has been a key driver to generating 16% sales growth in the fourth quarter, in particular. We noted in the third quarter of last year that we were starting to see labor trends change in a favorable way. Our hiring had improved. Our retention had dramatically improved, and we saw that trend continue in the fourth quarter. I think a few things contribute. We hire technology skills that are very akin to what the technology sector employees, and we've certainly seen softness in that sector that has led to a significant increase in applications to Northrop Grumman. But I'd also like to think it's to do to the reputation of our company as being a technology innovator and the successes that we were able to showcase last year like James Webb and the unveiling of B-21 really spiked interest in applications to -- for employment at our company. And so those 2 things in combination are certainly working in our favor in a differentiated way.
Operator: Our next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Just a follow up on an earlier comment. In the past, I think you've talked about 12% margins in 2024 and the 2023 guide is 11.5% or so. As you think about sort of inflationary pressures, what are you watching? And you mentioned some of the B-21 items as an example. So what sort of offsets that to get to that 50 basis points of expansion?
Kathy Warden: As we've noted, we had talked about 12% being the fundamental margin rate that we believe this business, this portfolio can perform at, and we would be working our way back to that as particularly mix becomes less of a headwind in the middle of the decade. We still see that. But we are having these temporal pressures related to inflation that are flowing through all of our programs, B-21 most notable because of its scale and that we did it very long ago. As we think about how we are offsetting those costs, we talked about some of those ways today. We are working to digitally enable our business, which reduces program costs directly and improve profitability. But we also are applying that to our back office to streamline business processes and reduce costs that flow into our overheads also making our rates more competitive. And reducing the impact of cost growth. So those things that -- real estate has been key. You saw today, we talked about a few things that we did in the real estate area already in 2022, but we have many more of those lined up as ways to continue to offset any cost growth that we see and drive towards those higher margins.
Operator: Our next question comes from Richard Safran with Seaport Global.
Richard Safran: Kathy, Dave, Todd, I think we probably all agree the stock right now seems to reflect the idea that defense is going to be a bill payer as we move to a period of deficit reduction. And I realize this question puts you a little bit on the spot forecasting government spending. But I wanted to know if you'd expand on your optimistic opening remarks. Talk about your macro outlook relative to what seems to be being priced into your stock? And if you think modernization might be sacrificed as part of the budget negotiations?
Kathy Warden: Yes. So we look at the stock price over a longer time horizon than weeks, and we've consistently outperformed the industry on a relative TSR basis over the long term. But as you indicate, -- we've seen some pullback in the last several weeks across the sector and even more so with Northrop Grumman. I am a little surprised at the level of relative pullback we've seen given our strong continued results, our growth outlook and the relative portfolio positioning that we have in the U.S. and internationally. And to answer the second part of your question directly, I do not see the U.S. or our allies pulling back on funding their national defense strategy that is well aligned with the Northrop Grumman portfolio. So I'd sum it up by saying, with a strong backlog, growing global demand for our products, differentiated technology and the ability to attract and retain top talent, we're really well positioned to continue executing on the strategy that we have that is expected to deliver differentiated growth and a potential to generate greater than 20% free cash flow growth for at least the next several years, and we believe beyond. So I think investors are going to like that. And we've been in periods like this before following sequestration, where there was noise in the system related to the government's commitment to national security. But following that, it was one of the best periods of relative TSR growth at our company, and really, our industry has produced in a while. So I see this as a temporal speed bump in our past and yet our strategy remains strong to deliver value.
Richard Safran: Just as a quick follow-up on inflation. The comments on the B-21 that you've been making, is there a general trend here is when your contracts you're signing right now with the government, are they generally accounting for inflationary effects or are you not finding that?
Kathy Warden: So our customers are engaging in conversations with industry to understand to motivate our investment in future capability and capacity, that is what they really want. And I think many of them now understand that shifting too much risk to industry doesn't support that investment, nor does it deliver the capability they need in a timely fashion. So with that, I expect we're going to see less the price development going forward. And they are specifically to inflation, the industry broadly is pushing back on accepting long-term fixed price contracts right now. And they're asking for reopeners for inflation. We expect that to continue. And as our suppliers ask us for that, we, of course, are passing that on to the government. And really, that's just common sense. So I believe it will become the norm.
Operator: Our next question comes from Douglas Harned with Bernstein.
Douglas Harned: Last year, you had a decline in Aeronautics that we understood pretty well because you've got quite a few legacy programs that were ramping down, like JSTARS Global Hawk. When you look at this year, with your fairly flat guidance for Aeronautics, how do you look at the pluses and minuses when we look at B-21 growth but you still got some legacy programs that are declining. How do you see those offsetting each other?
Kathy Warden: So Doug, this year is really a continuation of those same trends flowing through the top line. The programs that have been declining. We've seen the majority of those declines, but they do still flow into the '23, '22 compare. So it is things like Joint STARS and Global Hawk. F-35 being a big revenue contributor in AS is relatively flat. So that ties directly into the narrative about their revenues being flat. And then B-21 is an increase, but it's not a significant increase yet because we're just moving from EMD into LRIP and these 2 combined are not a significant increase in the program as of yet.
Douglas Harned: Well, and then on a slightly different topic. When you look at rocket motors, and this is an important area for you. And I'm trying to picture what the growth trajectory looks like. And also just in a sense of your market share, you've got 1 competitor that is a mature player. There are new entrants coming into the space. How do you see the long-term evolution of your market share and how you're positioned in that area?
Kathy Warden: So we stay focused on investing in the future capability needed and more so lately in the capacity needed. And in many ways, the reason we are being asked take on more share of the market is because we've been investing in this business and are able to take on that additional business because we have outfitted our manufacturing facilities to support the growth. As with the government is asking, we have been responsive. And so as a result, we are winning more business in that area. But we expect to be able to compete even as other new entrants come into the space because we do have a long heritage of expertise that contributes to our solid rocket motor business. And that's for all size, as I talked today and highlighted some of the larger solid rocket boosters that we build in support of SLS and GEM 63 for Kuiper. But that's true in businesses like [indiscernible] , where we are taking on more of the needed capacity because we've been investing in our manufacturing capacity there as well.
Operator: And our next question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.
Seth Seifman: I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the profitability in the space business. The margin guidance came down there, margin rate guidance came down there a couple of times during the year. And it's kind of perceived to be kind of a 10% business, I think, is what we've talked about in the past and looking to a second year in the mid-9s here in 2023. So what's changed there over the past year?
David Keffer: Seth, it's Dave. So I think you pointed out accurately that we're now projecting a margin rate for space in the mid-10s going forward. There were a lot of puts and takes in that margin rate upward and downward throughout 2022. Obviously, it's a rapidly evolving business, a tremendous amount of backlog growth and new program activity added into that portfolio over the last couple of years. So we're really pleased with the volume we're adding both at the top line and the bottom line in that process. Obviously, a lot of new cost type work being added to that portfolio and that mix growing, but also work that will evolve toward fixed price over the next couple of years and some new fixed price programs in that mix as well. So in aggregate, we think the mid-9s is the right way to look at 2023. In the coming years, we do see the opportunity for margin rate expansion. But I think the most important takeaway for the space business is that the volume of top and bottom line growth that we've been delivering over the last couple of years and now are projecting over the next few is really adding a lot of value there.
Seth Seifman: Okay. Okay. Great. And then just as a follow-up, Dave. So the working capital performance was quite good in '22. I think the way that measuring here. Working capital actually came down a bit despite the growth and despite the tough operating environment, only 6% of sales, which is below some of your peers. What's the opportunity from here? Or is there kind of a normalization at some point where actually for a growing business, the normal level of working capital is higher?
David Keffer: So let's talk about that for a few minutes. There is not a substantial change in working capital projected in the 3-year free cash flow guide that we gave today. There is more capital intensity in 2023 and 2024 that we've signaled throughout this year, given just how much more new business we were awarded this year and the additional capital investments that we need to make to support capacity and capability there. We've talked about things like the Amazon Kuiper Award and and other areas of the business that Kathy just noted, we're making investments upfront for these long-term franchise programs. So that is a headwind to free cash flow. But we're pleased to be able to offset that and deliver free cash flow guidance for '23 that's in line with our prior expectations. That's supported by the growth of the business, both top and bottom line. The R&D tax numbers will come down steadily over the next 5 years. And then gradually, over the next several years, we'll see improvements in the CAS pension cost reimbursement based on current projections. So not much change in working capital, but there are some other moving pieces in the mix. I think importantly, when we look at the underlying fundamentals of growth and margin rate, as we talked about in our scripted remarks, we do anticipate growth through this 3-year outlook that we've provided at the top line, and we are modeling small but gradual improvement in the margin rate as well. So that's a healthy underlying condition for free cash flow. And while we're at it, as we think about this outlook for free cash flow, the foundation is set for strong free cash flow beyond this 3-year period. The second half of this decade will have more programs moving to production, fewer of these upfront investments required to do so. The foundation we've laid over the last several years of capital investment is going to pay off in the second half of this decade on many of those programs. And so that's a healthy environment for continued growth in free cash flow as well as the continuation of the R&D tax amortization rolling off as a headwind. So when you look at the second half of the decade, I think your expectation should be more of the same strong growth in free cash flow that we've been talking about in the first half.
Operator: And our next question comes from Myles Walton with Wolfe Research.
Myles Walton: I did have a couple of follow-ups on the B-21, if that's okay. And Dave, I think you alluded that the first LRIP contracts to be awarded in '23. I'm just curious, is that sort of the triggering event or whether or not you'd know you're in the loss or not at that point? And then Kathy, I know you said the 10-K disclosure is over the 5 LRIP lots. But I'm just curious, is it tougher at the front end of those lot profiles? Is it more promises at the back end that you'd have time to fight off inflation? Anything on those 2 fronts?
David Keffer: Sure. I'll start on your first of those questions. The award of that first lot of LRIP will be a noteworthy event but not a triggering event of any kind from an accounting perspective. We will update our projections quarterly as we have been. We'll continue to do so. And so at this time, we don't believe that a loss is probable and therefore, we have not booked one. We do believe that a loss is possible, which is why we're including it in our remarks and our 10-K disclosures. It's something we will continue to work over time. Obviously, this is going to continue for a number of years. As Kathy has talked about, we'll continue to do everything we can to mitigate inflationary pressures and work with our customers and our suppliers in the process. Kathy, anything you'd like to add?
Kathy Warden: Sure. So in answer to your second question, we do expect to have a better sense as the year progresses, and we'll update disclosures as we do. And as we look at the profile, there's nothing really notable. To your point, we have more time to work cost efficiencies in the later lots. But of course, we made some more aggressive assumptions about learning curves and the like as we would on any production program. So really nothing notable in the profile and how you might think about any potential loss in spread.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research Partners.
Robert Stallard: Dave, I've got a couple of cash flow questions for you. First of all, on basically cash taxes with the R&D tax legislation impact. What sort of tailwind are you expecting from this -- from 2023 and onwards? And then secondly, what are your assumptions for equipment sales in that cash flow guidance for 2023 or for the whole period?
David Keffer: Sure. Thanks for those questions. The answers are pretty straightforward. As we noted, the impact on our cash taxes in 2022 from the R&D tax legislation was just under $1 billion. We would anticipate that being about 20% less per year, just under $200 million or so on average less per year. And so that is the magnitude of the annual tailwind that we'd anticipate for the next 5 years or so. Overall, cash taxes, excluding the impact of that R&D tax amortization will increase slightly over the coming years, but that's factored into our multiyear outlook. And as for equipment sales, I appreciate the question there. We received the final payment associated with the equipment sale that we booked a couple of years ago in 2022. And so we don't anticipate we're having our multiyear cash flow outlook, any continued recoveries from equipment sales.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen.
Unidentified Analyst: This is actually Jack on for Cai today. Just a quick question back to kind of the Section 174, Dave, I know in the past, I'm not sure if you quantified that if you could actually provide that dollar figure if you could. I know it steps down 20% each year. But looking back at your guide from last year at this time for '24, it looks like a larger delta than an implied $700 million headwind. So just to confirm, is that incremental CapEx going higher? Or if you could just provide some color there, that would be helpful.
David Keffer: Sure. I appreciate those questions. I think you have to the air math about right on 174. It was just under $1 billion in 2022, and it will decline by just under $200 million a year on average going forward. In terms of that 2024 guide, you're right that our CapEx expectations increased a bit given the volume of new business that we won this year that we'll be investing in going forward. No other material changes to 2024. We do anticipate growth as we've seen in '24 and then a real ramp in '25 as CapEx begins to decline, and you have the tailwinds as well in '25 and beyond from R&D tax, CAS pension recoveries and the underlying growth in margins in the business.
Operator: Our next question comes from Peter Arment with RW Baird.
Peter Arment: Kathy, within Aeronautics, the service mix continues to be a bigger part of the story. I guess it's now about 22%. If you finish 22 and look, that's up from the mid-teens the last few years. Obviously, there's some puts and takes on why that is. But just wondering if this trend is going to continue and how you think about the impact on margins?
Kathy Warden: Yes. So we do expect the trend to continue in terms of -- as assets get into service, we continue to support. But we also have assets like Global Hawk that are coming down. So I don't see a material change in that mix as we look forward, Peter.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ken Herbert with RBC Capital.
Kenneth Herbert: Kathy, in your opening comments, I think you maybe called out international opportunities, perhaps a little bit more than I can remember from recent quarters. Can you help frame maybe how much of an uptick in international opportunities could be reflected or international sales could be reflected in the '23 guide, if that was all a part of any of the upward revision -- and then as you think about beyond '23, how meaningful is international in terms of an uptick for you? I know historically, obviously, it hasn't been as meaningful as part of the mix of some of your peers, but maybe you can comment on that expanding opportunity set?
Kathy Warden: Yes. Thank you. So in the fourth quarter, we did see some meaningful uptick in Defense Systems, and you can see that reflected in our results, both from the areas that I outlined in this call related to ammunitions and armaments but also increased interest in IBCS, and we have the current Poland work continuing to ramp but the 10 additional countries that I've noticed that have expressed interest. So as we think about the near-term drivers, it's the things that we already have in production. But as we think about the longer-term drivers is areas like IBCS future sales. And we are seeing that interest increase across the business, but most notably in '23, I think you will see that reflected as upside opportunity in defense. As we look at the enterprise over the next several years, we do expect our international growth rate to be double-digit, low teens compared to a U.S. growth rate that more in the norm of our mid-single digits. So as we think about international, we do expect it to grow as a percent of our portfolio in the next several years. And that's all based on international demand growing as a result of increased spending confirmations made by our allied partners.
Operator: Our question comes from Scott Deuschle with Credit Suisse.
Scott Deuschle: Kathy, if I go back to 2018 when the group sold off quite a bit, Northrop got pretty active on buying back stock. And I think you even launched an ASR, if I recall correctly. So I'd be curious if that would still be your playbook this year if the valuation continues to come down? And whether you might lean on the balance sheet to do so just given the track record of having run a valuation-sensitive buyback program?
Kathy Warden: Yes. Well, as you note, we have used ASRs as the tool in the past. And as we indicated in the call today, we do plan to put more than 100% of our free cash flow back into the deployment to shareholders. The fact that our valuation is down, really, we don't try to time the market per se. But we do think about that as we are kind of weighing our options for capital deployment this year, and we do have the flexibility to increase share repurchase from our original plan. So that is something we're actively contemplating.
Operator: Our next question comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro.
George Shapiro: Dave, I had one for you. In the operating income discussion in space, you had a big gain, $45 million charge. And you said it was all -- the $96 million gain only partially offset the lower EACs. When I look at the K for the year, you had minus $38 million in space versus $134 million last year. So if you kind of just discuss what happened in the quarter and just why such a significant change year-over-year?
David Keffer: Sure. Well, that's a great question, George. Clearly, that's an indication of the broader macroeconomic conditions that we in our industry, and frankly, most other industries we're facing in 2022, and in our business, it impacted the level of net EAC adjustments in really each of our sectors in different ways. And you see it acutely there in space, as you mentioned. A number of those EAC adjustments were in the fourth quarter. And that kind of -- the net of all those puts and takes to include the inventory adjustment on a new commercial product line that you mentioned was another downside in Q4. Those were roughly offset by the upside from the land exchange transaction in space. So a number of puts and takes, but when you net it all out, not much overall impact on the space margin rate in Q4 or for the year. We're forecasting a rate just above that level that we operated at in '22 as we now look at '23. And as I noted earlier, something in the mid-9s is our kind of going forward expectation for '23 margin rate in space.
George Shapiro: But Dave, it's still unusual to see negative EACs for the year. So I was just wondering, are there any specifics that you could point to maybe was for the year or just for this quarter?
David Keffer: No single item was a driver of that of much more significance than any other. I think that alone, George, is an indication of the fact that this was more in line with broader macroeconomic pressures as opposed to any performance issue or contract issue in any particular program. This was broader and more widespread, but not significant on any one program in and of itself. And again, I think really just indicative here of the environment we were operating in, in a business with a lot of programs, a lot of new growth in recent years to be excited about.
George Shapiro: Okay. And then just one general one for you, Kathy. I mean, with the better sales growth you're guiding to in '23, a result of the budget or new awards won or both? And then also, with 16% sales growth in Q4 and outlay is likely to grow 7% or 8% in '23 based on the budget investment authority of 15. Why does the growth rate slow that much in '23? I mean why wouldn't it be higher than what you're suggesting?
Kathy Warden: Yes. So as we noted throughout 2022, if we could break loose supplier deliveries and continue to improve labor trends, we could deliver accelerated growth. And fourth quarter exemplified a path to doing just that. As we come into 2023 with that momentum, the same holds, we are confident enough in our sales expectations as we sit here today to raise them above what we had said in October, largely because we are seeing those improvements in labor in particular. And if those trends continue, we would have opportunity to even further accelerate growth in 2024. The budget does not play into this. We had assumed strong budget growth. It, of course, came to fruition in the '23 budget, and we continue to believe the '24 President's budget will also show growth.
Todd Ernst: Norma, we have time for one more question.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Strauss with Barclays.
David Strauss: Great. A lot of discussion on B-21 and EMD and LRIP. Just -- how should we think about what happens to AS margins over the next couple of years as I assume EMD flans out or starts to come down where you've been taking positive adjustments and LRIP ramps up from here?
David Keffer: David, I'll start on that one. Our margin rate was particularly high in AS in 2022. That was driven in part by the strong performance on those EMD profit pickups associated with anticipated incentives on that part of the program. We projected a 10% or so level for AS margins in '23 and expect that, that's a reasonable kind of planning assumption at this point for '23. And as we look forward beyond that, a lot of the factors that are working into the '23 estimate would be those that we'd expect to continue beyond '23. So of course, we'll update you over time. You mentioned B-21 EMD program will -- a portion of the contract will continue for a number of years on LRIP. We haven't baked any margin or cash in that part of the program into our multiyear outlook or our '23 guide. So we think that 10% level is the right way to think about kind of the underlying margin rate in AS in the near term.
David Strauss: Okay. And Kathy, maybe your thoughts on what bookings could look like this year, what you're anticipating for the book to bill this year?
Kathy Warden: Yes, David. So we had projected book-to-bill to be light in 2022, and it turned out to be 1.07. We are projecting it to be light again in 2023. I've noted before, we look at this over a multiyear period. We've been running at 1.2 for the last 4 years aggregated across those 4 years. So we still expect to be well over 1 when we think about a 5-year aggregated book-to-bill, but we do expect 2023 to be less than 1.
Todd Ernst: All right. Great. Thanks. Kathy, over to you.
Kathy Warden: So look, 2022 was another year of outstanding performance by the Northrop Grumman team, and I want to thank them. As we reflected on our call today, we're even more encouraged with the opportunities for continued growth and value creation for our company in 2023 and beyond. So hopefully, that conveyed to you. Thanks again for joining our call today.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-10-27 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Northrop Grumman's Third Quarter 2022 Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. My name is Michelle and I will be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] I would like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Todd Ernst, Treasurer and Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Ernst, please proceed.
Todd Ernst: Thanks, Michelle. Good morning, everyone and welcome to Northrop Grumman's third quarter 2022 conference call. We'll refer to a PowerPoint presentation that is posted on our IR web page this morning. Before we start, matters discussed on today's call, including guidance and outlooks for 2022 and beyond, reflect the company's judgment based on information available at the time of this call. They constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to safe harbor provisions of federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which are noted in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties may cause actual company results to differ materially. Today's call will include non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to our GAAP results in our earnings release. On the call today are Kathy Warden, our Chair, CEO and President; and Dave Keffer, our CFO. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kathy. Kathy?
Kathy Warden: Thanks, Todd. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. The Northrop Grumman team delivered another quarter of solid performance. Our top line returned to growth with continued strong execution. Demand for our products remained robust with a book-to-bill ratio of near 1, including a number of key awards in our restricted and Missile Defense portfolios. And we remain on track to deliver strong results for the year, with growth expected to accelerate as we look toward next year. Taking a step back for a moment from the quarter, I'd like to start with an update on the global security environment. Earlier this month, the Biden administration released its full version of the National Security Strategy which is used as a guide for policy and budget decisions. The strategy spotlights the dynamic and challenging threat landscape around the world and stresses the importance of working with allies, maintaining a strong industrial base and continuing to invest in advanced technology. It also reinforces the triad as a top priority. So, it's clear that Northrop Grumman's portfolio continues to be extremely well aligned with the requirements outlined in the National Security Strategy. This is reflected in the administration's fiscal year 2023 budget request which showed alignment with these priorities and strong support for many of our key programs. Throughout this summer, congressional committees marked up the administration's defense budget request, generally increasing the proposed level of funding with the intent of strengthening the country's defense posture and addressing the impacts of inflation. Based on these additions, we believe that the ultimate fiscal year '23 base defense budget will be higher than the President's budget request. And as you know, we started off this fiscal year in another continuing resolution which currently extends to mid-December and this is factored into our guidance. We are confident in our program funding positions and hopeful that the annual budget will be passed by year-end. Meanwhile, global commitments to invest in Defense and National Security capability continue. In Europe, we've seen increased demand for our Integrated Air and Missile Defense solutions and precision weapons and advanced ammunition. In the Asia Pacific region, we've seen similar interest in Air and Missile Defense as well as Maritime ISR, Advanced Radar and other Mission Systems. All this points to a strong demand environment for Northrop Grumman. And we're doing our part by investing in solutions and capacity to address many of our customers' most pressing needs. This year, we expect to invest over $2.5 billion in CapEx and research and development. And as a result, we're winning new business and bolstering our backlog for long-term growth. Our backlog has increased year-to-date in each of our 4 segments and is up nearly 5% overall. Given this, we now expect that our full year 2022 book-to-bill ratio will be over 1, a significant improvement from where we started the year. This increase is attributed not only to the robust defense budget environment but also a strong competitive win rate. That said, we recognize that our industry and many others are experiencing macroeconomic volatility that we haven't seen in decades. Inflation remains at 40-year high, lead times have been extended in certain areas of our supply chain and the labor market shows signs of easing but it remains tight for critical skills. Our team is tackling these challenges, keeping a focus on our people and performance and driving efficiencies across the business. In the labor market, we've driven improvements in hiring and retention over the past several months which Dave will describe in more detail. This was instrumental in our return to growth in the third quarter. And it's worth noting that this favorable trend has continued into the fourth quarter as well. This supports our full year 2022 guidance and our outlook for accelerated sales in 2023. In the supply chain, we continue to experience disruptions in delayed deliveries in certain areas of our business which we have -- that has been a headwind to growth. It's a risk that we're closely monitoring and we're working with our suppliers to mitigate. But we do anticipate that supply chain challenges will continue in 2023 and this is now reflected into our 2023 outlook. Elevated inflation levels in both labor and supply chain has persisted more than expected as we came into this year. To address this, we are implementing operational efficiencies and working with many of our customers on program funding and other contract actions to support the health of the defense industrial base. We believe this balanced approach is the best solution to allow continued investment in the capabilities to support our customers' mission. With that said, we see these as temporal challenges and remain committed to driving our segment margin rates higher over time. Turning now to the execution of our long-term strategy. One of the key elements of our strategy is a relentless focus on performance. That's why I was particularly pleased to receive the 2022 Deming Cup for operational excellence on behalf of Northrop Grumman earlier this week. The award recognizes our achievements and leadership in creating a culture of operational excellence and continuous improvement across the company. Our customers recognize this commitment and have entrusted us to deliver some of the most technologically advanced next-generation systems and solutions. The B-21 Raider is 1 such example and we're excited to unveil the aircraft to the public on December 2. The B-21s outstanding performance can be directly tied to our company's investment in digital tools and facilities and the incredible U.S. Air Force and Northrop Grumman team, who are developing this sixth-generation platform. The program continues to progress through testing in preparation for first flight in 2023. Last month, we announced a data sharing agreement on B-21, enhancing data access and collaboration across the program, including the launch of a shared environment for the B-21 digital twin. This data sharing agreement enhances our partnership with the Air Force and further demonstrates our digital maturity on the program. Our Mission Systems solutions are another area of our portfolio where innovation is critical to success, where the fast pace of threats and new technologies is driving the need for platforms and sensors to be able to connect with one another, share data and be part of a broader family of systems. In this growing market, we're building on our strong position in sensors, secure communications and networking to compete for and win new opportunities. For example, last month, we were selected to be a member of the Air Force's ABMS Digital Infrastructure Consortium. And we're also seeing interest from global customers including the Australian Defense Force where we recently demonstrated a product solution with robust C2 functionality to link sensors and effectors across domains. Another significant area of focus for the U.S. and our allies is the modernization of Missile Defense solutions to address current and future missile threats. We continue to strengthen our position in this area with a $1.3 billion Ground-based Midcourse Defense Weapon System award in the third quarter. This award builds on our Missile Defense portfolio and helps our customers defend against intermediate and intercontinental missile attacks. And turning to our weapons business. I'm pleased to share that we've now delivered more than 100,000 Precision Guidance Kits to the U.S. Army. These projectiles provide enhanced precision to artillery units and come embedded with built-in safety features. We've exceeded requirements on both accuracy and reliability with these upgrades. And one last area that I'll highlight is hypersonics, where we continue to win new competitive business. Last month, the Air Force selected our Raytheon and Northrop Grumman team to develop the Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile also known as HACM. HACM builds on our scramjet propulsion technology and ushers in a new era of faster, more survivable weapons. This program is one of several hypersonic opportunities within our portfolio. We're approaching this market as both a prime and a sub, bringing our expertise in high-speed propulsion, survival navigation and targeting capabilities and systems integration to multiple solutions. These are just a few examples of markets where we continue to grow our business by delivering the products and solutions that our customers want and need, while also building long-term value for our shareholders. So now, I'll turn it over to Dave, who will provide more color on our Q3 results and touch on our expectations for 2023. Dave?
Dave Keffer: Okay. Thanks, Kathy and good morning, everyone. As you heard from Kathy, we delivered solid results across all key metrics in Q3. We're reaching an inflection point in our sales growth, driven by the strength in the demand environment, our new business performance and our success in hiring and retaining employees. We had another strong quarter for bookings with roughly $8.7 billion in awards. This contributed to a year-to-date book-to-bill ratio of 1.14 and an increase in our full year book-to-bill expectations. Our Q3 top line results of roughly $9 billion, were up sequentially from Q2 and up about 3% compared with the third quarter of 2021. This acceleration has been driven by our positive hiring trends. We added nearly 1,000 net new employees in Q2 and we added an additional 2,700-plus people in Q3. With continued positive hiring and retention results, we've improved our labor-driven sales visibility, so the supply base is now the key to achieving our full year sales outlook. We're seeing temporal challenges in the supply chain, as are most others, including longer lead times and higher costs in some areas. Our suppliers are a critical element of the Defense Industrial Base and we're closely monitoring small businesses, who are the most vulnerable to the challenges of this macroeconomic environment, particularly inflation. We're encouraged by recent comments from Congress on this topic and we're actively working with our customers to help mitigate inflationary effects on our contracts, including those being felt by our suppliers. Our program execution remained solid in the quarter, with segment margins of 11.2%, reflecting lower net EAC adjustments due in part to the inflationary pressures that we've noted. As costs have remained elevated, we've captured our latest estimates of inflation and opportunities to mitigate it in our EACs. This had a downward effect on our margins in Q3. But year-to-date, our segment margins are 11.7% and we continue to expect the full year rate to be in the range of 11.7% to 11.9%. Turning to earnings per share. Our diluted EPS in the quarter were $5.89. The year-over-year earnings decline was driven by nonoperational factors, including lower net pension income, unfavorable returns on our marketable securities and an insurance settlement for $60 million that was recognized in the third quarter of 2021. Together, these items represented roughly $0.85 of year-over-year EPS headwinds but as I pointed out, our businesses continue to execute very well in a complex environment. In terms of cash, we generated outstanding operational cash flows in the third quarter of over $1.3 billion and we expect Q4 to be even better. This is consistent with our historical pattern of collections and disbursements. In the quarter, we made our third cash tax payment associated -- aided with the R&D amortization law of approximately $220 million and we continue to expect roughly $1 billion in cash tax payments related to R&D for the full year. Through the end of Q3, we completed over $1 billion in share repurchases and we're on track for an additional $500 million in the fourth quarter. Now moving to 2022 guidance. We have not changed our sales, earnings or cash outlooks. The foundation for our strong financial performance starts with the continued demand we're seeing for our products. We're increasing our expectation for book-to-bill again this quarter to greater than 1x which is a significant improvement from our original expectation. Our team has done an outstanding job of serving as a trusted partner to our customers in winning new business. We're maintaining our original guidance for the top line. And based on year-to-date results, we continue to expect our full year sales to be around the low end of the range, consistent with the trends we described last quarter. Our full year outlook implies Q4 sales of roughly $9.6 billion which represents excellent sequential and year-over-year growth. As we've noted throughout the year, we anticipate that Q4 will include a strong volume of material receipts across each of our 4 segments. We're also maintaining our guidance for the bottom line, including segment OM rate and earnings per share. Given that 2022 sales volume will be around the low end of the range, we expect EPS to be near the low end of its range also. Within our earnings outlook, we're accounting for continued year-to-date pressure on our marketable securities portfolio, offset by an anticipated federal tax rate benefit in Q4. Our marketable securities are down nearly $100 million in 2022 which represents about $0.50 of earnings per share pressure. But on the income tax line, we've lowered our effective rate expectation from 17% to 15.5%, reflecting progress in resolving matters related to historical filings in 1 of our businesses. We currently expect those matters to be concluded in Q4, resulting in about $0.50 of EPS benefit that offsets the marketable securities pressure. It's also possible that the tax item could be resolved in Q1 which would shift the benefit from 2022 into 2023. Moving to cash flows. While we remain optimistic that Congress will repeal or defer the R&D amortization law, we have focused our free cash flow guidance this year on the current tax laws scenario which is unchanged from last quarter. If the law is deferred or repealed in Q4, we would expect a onetime spike in state taxes recognized in corporate unallocated expense, as well as a cash refund in 2023. Operationally, we're very pleased with the progress we made in cash flows in Q3, bolstering our confidence in the full year outlook. Next, I'd like to take a few moments to describe the outlook for our pension plans. Most importantly, our current funded status remains strong and roughly unchanged year-to-date and the cash flow implications of CAS changes over the next several years provide a modest benefit. The GAAP income statement effects I'll describe today are noncash in nature. Year-to-date, our plans have experienced double-digit negative returns and discount rates have risen nearly 250 basis points. This combination of results will affect our GAAP earnings in future years. So I'd like to take a moment to discuss what our 2023 net pension income would look like under various scenarios. In January, we provided a sensitivity table in our earnings call deck related to changes in discount rates and asset returns on our nonservice FAS pension income. Based on the high level of volatility, the pension funds have experienced so far this year, I wanted to provide a grid of potential outcomes that also incorporates FAS service expense and CAS costs which can be found on Slide 9 of our presentation today. To help calibrate you to this slide, we've highlighted the 2023 pension estimates provided in January which were based on expected 2022 asset returns of 7.5% and a year-end discount rate of roughly 3%. Given the year-to-date asset returns and discount rates at the end of Q3, we would expect significantly lower net FAS pension income in 2023, currently in the range of over $900 million less than our previous projection. As I've described, this lower net FAS pension income is noncash in nature. Over time, higher CAS recoveries would lead to modestly higher cash flow related to our pension. I also wanted to provide additional insights on a high-level financial outlook for 2023. Note that this is predicated on our current expectations regarding the macro environment. As Kathy said, we expect strong demand to continue into 2023. In terms of hiring and retention trends, as I've now shared a few times, we've seen improvements since the beginning of 2022 and we anticipate that this will remain consistent next year. In the supply chain, where the environment has remained challenging with various delays and disruptions, we project that those challenges will continue throughout 2023. And with regard to inflation which has been more persistent in '22 than originally expected, our projections incorporate gradual easing based on the latest industry labor and material indices. As Kathy described, we continue to expect our sales growth to accelerate next year, building on the momentum we've driven in 2022. In total, we expect sales growth in the 4% to 5% range. Based on our low $36 billion expectation for 2022, that would put us in a high $37 billion range for 2023. Within our segments, we continue to expect Space to remain our fastest-growing business, with sales growing by another $1 billion over 2022. We expect strong sales growth in MS in the mid-single-digit range. And we anticipate sales at AS and DS to be flattish compared with their latest 2022 levels. We also expect to generate solid segment margin rates. As I've described, net EAC improvements are likely to be lighter than usual until inflation begins to normalize. So we'd expect our segment OM rate which would otherwise have been projected in the high 11% range next year, to be between the mid-11% and the high 11%. With regard to earnings, pension income will be a noncash headwind as quantified on Slide 9. But excluding pension, we expect our earnings per share to grow faster than sales in 2023, driven by continued strong execution and a lower share count. We expect our tax rate to return to its more normal level of around 17% next year. And we continue to generate excellent cash flows with our prior 3-year cash outlook intact and another year of free cash flow growth expected in 2025. We anticipate modest increases to our prior CapEx projections based on the strength of this year's new business wins and backlog growth, offset by corresponding improvements in operating cash flows. We're very proud of the performance we've delivered this year in a continued challenging environment and we're pleased with our projected growth acceleration in the second half of 2022 and in 2023. With our multiyear cash flow outlook intact, we're looking forward to continuing to create value for our customers and shareholders. And with that, we're ready for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein.
Doug Harned: You talked about supply chain here and that’s obviously an issue across the board. Is it possible to look at the constraints you had from the supply chain and give us a sense of what the quarter and the year might have looked like had you not had those constraints? We’re just trying to figure out, what sort of normal would be and how much is being held back?
Kathy Warden: Doug, thanks for the question. Supply chain certainly is central to not only the remainder of this year but next. So let me try to characterize, not particularly in numerical terms but in more -- less quantitative terms, what we have been seeing. It is in particular areas of the supply chain. So it is not widespread but it's in areas that are important -- is component to our development programs, in particular, where we have seen delays that then result in impacts to those development efforts. And so it's the timing of sales not necessarily a deferment of sales, if you will. And this year, I would point to our 2022 original guidance which was our expectations with either minimal or no supply chain disruption, because when we put that plan together late last year, we were not anticipating the level of supply chain disruption nor the duration of supply chain disruption that we've experienced. So throughout the year, we've pointed you now to the low end of our sales guidance. And I would say the best way to think quantitatively about the impact is, we would have expected to be on the high end of that guidance had we not experienced the supply chain disruption. Now I do want to point out and we've said it in the call that we expect these challenges to persist into 2023. So when I talk about timing, we do not expect all of what we experienced in 2022 to recover by the end of 2023. We expect these issues to be a bit sticky for the next year. We do expect them to resolve in the 18- to 24-month time frame.
Doug Harned: And as you go into 2023, you said in the outlook that Space is expected to be up by about $1 billion but flat at Aeronautics. So can you help us understand what the drivers are in those 2 units that lead to somewhat different results? Obviously, you have huge backlog in Space. But just trying to understand those 2 trajectories?
Dave Keffer: Sure. Doug, I'm happy to shed some light on that. In both cases, those trends are consistent with what we've communicated previously and the drivers are therefore consistent as well. Starting in AS, we project a stable 2023 given that there is anticipated growth in programs, including B-21 but then offset by modest declines in programs like the legacy programs in the HALE portfolio, Joint STARS, et cetera, modest decline in F-18 likely over the next couple of years. So again, continuation of trends we've been talking about for a while and we continue to anticipate a growth recovery in 2024 for that business. In Space, the expansion and the growth opportunity is broad-based across multiple orbits, across multiple mission areas from missile tracking to ISR, growth in our supportive launch capabilities. It's really an outstanding segment of performance for us recently on the growth side. You see a growing market but growth also in our market share. Of course, GBSD is a contributor to that growth but by no means the only one. Each of our divisions in that business is growing at a nice clip. So we’re really pleased to be able to continue that outlook in ‘23.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Ronald Epstein with Bank of America.
Ronald Epstein: Maybe just a question on capital deployment. You're going to be generating a lot of cash as you pointed that out. What's your plans to do with that into next year? Is there -- is it just share buybacks? Or is there some selected M&A? Or how are you thinking about that?
Kathy Warden: So our -- plans for capital deployment are still aligned with what we've been saying all year, a balanced approach to capital deployment, still investing in supporting the growth of the business that we've experienced which as we said, has been even more robust we anticipated coming into this year, not just because demand is higher but we have been quite successful in competitive wins. So we'll continue to invest to be able to deliver that business successfully and generate the resulting earnings and cash flows from it. We also look at our dividend as a significant part of our capital deployment strategy. We have been consistently raising the dividend, this year another 10% increase. And so we will think favorably into next year about the dividend as a mechanism for returning capital to shareholders. The remaining piece is share repurchase which I know was the core part of your question and this year, we are on track for $1.5 billion of share repurchase. We plan to complete that. We do expect that to be slightly higher next year. As we look at our plans for capital deployment, we will share those with you in more specificity and what our guidance is for share count in January. But safe to say, we are still on the mindset of returning 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders. And those 3 elements are the major ways in which we'll do that in 2023.
Ronald Epstein: Got it. And then one follow-on, if I can. On the supply chain stuff that’s been impacting the whole industry. Are you seeing DoD doing anything to help resolve it? Because some of the issues, it seems like you’re running into it, everybody’s running into it. Is DoD doing anything to help the industry?
Kathy Warden: Yes, they are. And I applaud the work that DoD is doing. I think they and we would agree that we need to continue to do more, particularly for medium and small businesses, who find themselves lower in the supply chain and even in circumstances where primes may have a cost-plus contract. They often have fixed prices that we need to adjust. And so the government working with the prime to address that impact on small businesses, I outlined in my comments earlier on this call, is going to be important for the health of the Defense Industrial Base. And we, as an industry, are doing our part. Certainly looking at those investments and managing some of our cash into the supply chain in ways that we have not historically done for the benefit of keeping those businesses healthy. And we’ve been doing that now for the last several years, really since the pandemic began and I expect we will continue to do that. There are impacts, though, to large business as well. And so we are all in this together, as you point out and we have work ahead of us. I am encouraged by Congress’ comments that they expect that the ‘23 budget will start to address some of these challenges. And I’m hopeful that as the administration puts their 2024 budget together, they will continue on the path to identifying funding that would allow us to keep the Defense Industrial Base healthy.
Operator: And our next question is going to come from the line of Myles Walton with Wolfe Research.
Myles Walton: Dave or Kathy, I’m not sure which. The fourth quarter recovery, I think you pointed out was going to come from receipt or timing of material receipts. I’m just curious, does that put you more at risk from supplier performance than your own internal performance, as you go into the fourth quarter? Is that the way to think about it?
Dave Keffer: Myles, it's Dave. I'm happy to address that one. I think the way we look at it is, the really strong head count growth that we've had over the last quarter, in particular but the last 6 months broadly, adding approximately 4% to our overall employee count or over 3,500 employees really shores up the labor visibility for labor-driven sales for 2022 and sets us off on a good track for '23. And to your point, that means the supply base and its performance are key to the fourth quarter. With that said, we've had a year now of these more challenged supply chain conditions to become accustomed to where there are constraints and where there are not. And I give a lot of credit to our supply chain folks and our program teams, who are managing and mitigating those challenges every day. We think we've got that captured in our outlook for Q4. The pressures to date have pushed us towards the low end of the sales range for the full year and we think that's appropriate caution as a result of the supply chain conditions but feel that we've bounded it well in that range as we think about Q4 and the full year now.
Myles Walton: Okay. And maybe just a follow-up. Within Space, the negative EACs there. Is it – is there any program-driven drivers to those negative EACs? Or is it purely cost and inflation dropping through across the portfolio?
Dave Keffer: There was not any 1 single program EAC that drove a material change this quarter in the Space business or any other across our portfolio. I think you're right to point to the broader market conditions. Costs are escalating at a level not expected a year or 2 ago. We're mitigating that very well across our business. But in fact, our latest expectations are factored into the EACs on our programs and that did have a dampening effect, particularly in Space's margins in Q3.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley.
Kristine Liwag: One of your peers has recently announced significant new share repurchase authorizations using debt. Considering the multiyear visibility in the cash flow, the strength in the balance sheet and the upward pressure on defense budgets, would you consider levering up an increased buyback similar to what the company did a decade ago?
Kathy Warden: Well, Kristine, I wouldn't rule it out as we sit here today but I'm also not announcing any plans. We currently are executing our strategy which is, as I said a few minutes ago, for a balanced capital deployment strategy and we think that is the right thing for our company. Our foundation and fundamentals are incredibly strong. With the growth in our backlog, the ability to grow the business top line, we want to ensure that we're investing appropriately in that. It's the best thing for our shareholders in the long-term, we believe, as well as our customers who need this capability and capacity that we're delivering. So that remains our top priority. And we, as I have said, are committed to return 100% of our free cash flow this year and that to our shareholders and we'll do that in the balance of dividends and share repurchase. But as you know, we have used ASRs in the past and we have looked at share repurchase and we'll continue to do that on a regular basis and keep you apprised of any change in our plan.
Kristine Liwag: And if I could do a follow-up. You mentioned that you expect supply chain issues to persist into 2023. Can you provide more color on what’s embedded in your 2023 revenue outlook of 4% to 5%? Where are the risks and opportunities to that?
Kathy Warden: So in the -- earlier in the call, we outlined 3 major elements that we are monitoring closely. The first is our own labor. And we have talked about that throughout this year as being a bit of a headwind for us in the first half of the year. We were not adding headcount and retaining headcount at the level we needed to fuel our growth. And that started to turn the corner in the summer. And you've seen in the third quarter, really robust results in net headcount growth, as Dave outlined, with nearly 3,000 adds. We are this environment that we're experiencing currently, not necessarily nearly 3,000 adds in a quarter but this hiring and retention environment is what persisted into 2023. There could be some opportunity there. As you all know certain firms are reducing their headcount or at least their hiring. So ER, as I noted, seen that in certain areas, the labor market is starting to soften. But we aren't counting on that being a significant tailwind to us next year. We're looking at it continuing about like we see it today. In supply chain, as we noted, we do expect the disruption that we now see in the supply chain to have lingering effects into 2023. And we've done our best to capture those in what we've now reflected as our updated guidance. But if they were to get worse, we certainly would have some downside risk. I don't expect them to get significantly better. So unlike labor, I would say that one is more of a risk. And then in the third area of inflation, we are tying to the indices as we look forward. We certainly have now captured the inflationary pressures that some of what we indicated was the downside on segment operating margin rates that we saw in the third quarter of this year. And your guess is as good as mine as to, when this inflation really start to modulate. So we're using the indices as our best way to get our arms around that. I don't see that as a big opportunity or risk. I think that one we probably have hedged pretty well but we're monitoring it, as I said. So, that was a lot of context. But I think it’s important because we did put a 2023 outlook in front of you, even at this early stage which we often do but I will say this is a more volatile time than we often experience going into the following year.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rob Stallard with Vertical Research Partners.
Rob Stallard: Dave, I’m going to start with you. On the 2023 margin guidance, are you expecting any major changes in the segments versus where they’re likely to end up at the end of this year?
Dave Keffer: Thanks for the question, Rob. We do not anticipate meaningful movements in the segments as we look at '23. Let's talk in aggregate first and then I'll give you some color on the segments. As you'll recall, our segment OM rate was in the 12% range in the first half of this year. We talked on the call today about the fact that, that will fluctuate a bit from quarter-to-quarter. We worked through some of -- temporal challenges that we and most other industries face these days around inflation and supply chain and such and noted some of that in the Q3 result. Year-to-date, we're in that guidance range we've provided for the full year. As we talk about next year, we noted mid- to high 11% or our current expectation. Think of that as in the range of 20 basis points lower next year than we're seeing this year. And at a business level, what I'd highlight is in a few of the areas where we had unique upside in the first half of the year, that's where we would expect that to normalize and create some of the lower margin profile next year. I'd note, AS had a land sale in the second quarter. So you can think of that as 20, 30 basis points of margin rate pressure on a year-over-year comp basis. In Space, we think the volume of new development work they've continued to add and the pressure that's put on their margin this year is again a good reflector of what you'd be likely to see next year in Space. Mission Systems and Defense continues to perform well on the margin rate side and we don't anticipate meaningful movement there. MS did have some strong upside in the first half. So we'll look to see what they can continue to deliver in '23. Again, no meaningful movements across the board. I'd just adjust for some of those comparability items in '23 to get a segment level view.
Rob Stallard: That’s great. Very helpful. And then just a quick follow-up for Kathy on the B-21. We’re looking forward to the rollout in December. But I was wondering, how the numbers on the program are progressing. Practically, you’re making good progress. But given it’s a fixed price program with inflation, how are the margins on this program going?
Kathy Warden: Yes, Rob, thanks for the question. We are also very excited about the rollout on December 2 but we are keeping our focus on the performance of the program. So while it's important for us to celebrate milestones as they come. It's also long-term program, as you suggest. And so we are working that program as we are all to each quarter reflect what we know about the current environment and our projections going forward. And as we outlined earlier this year, we spent a good bit of time actually talking through the B-21 and how we were keeping our assumptions updated. That continues to hold true. And so there’s nothing to report to you in any material change on our outlook for the profitability on that program.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: You talked about flattish Defense sales next year. Can you give us some of the puts and takes in the business with supply chain? Does that continue to linger and what’s going on in the services side? And maybe incremental opportunities with programs, such as IBCS and missiles and how you do think about Europe playing into that as well?
Kathy Warden: Thanks, Sheila. Certainly, the disruption that we're talking about does hit short-cycle businesses a little more than long cycle. And so there is a bit of that in Defense but really, it's more about the portfolio shift that we are making. One is the growth that we're seeing in munitions and particularly that demand which we expect to grow even more with the conflict in Ukraine. But we also see IBCS as a centerpiece of that growth, both domestically and internationally. I noted in my comments that we have gotten significantly more increased interest in demand coming out of Europe on IBCS over the last several months. So those are growth drivers. But those are offset by retirements of legacy platforms that we sustain out of the Defense Systems sector. And we’ve been talking about those as headwinds to AS for a while. But as those programs are retired, those platforms sustainment impacts are being felt in DS. So that would be programs like Joint STARS and Global Hawk.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.
George Shapiro: Dave, in terms of your margin guidance next year, how much lower are you expecting EACs to be? Because this year, they’re running so far like $150 million lower than last year and yet you’re getting help in AS but the margin looks like it’s going to turn out to be similar to where it was last year.
Dave Keffer: Sure. George, as you know, we don't have a specific dollar for dollar expectation of net EACs on any one program or in fact, in aggregate, going into a typical year. What we do get a sense for is kind of trends in aggregate volume. And in 2021, for example, we had a unique trend associated with the benefit in our rates from the pension benefit. In 2022, we've had a couple of upside items, as you mentioned, in AS. But broadly speaking, the pressures that we've noted from the macro environment this year. And what I'd characterize '23 as is more of a continuation of some of those macro pressures, as Kathy outlined nicely earlier in the supply chain and the inflationary environment. And so we'd anticipate what I'd characterize as a continuation of the lower net EAC trend in '23 based on what we know today. But I wouldn't put too fine of a point on the dollar amount today. We'll give you more insights on that as we get into the January guidance call.
George Shapiro: Yes, I’m just looking at the fact that this year’s segment margin is likely to be similar to last year’s and yet EACs are running already $150 million below where they were last year. So maybe they’ll be down $200 million for the year. And so you got to have a pretty sizable, maybe a bigger drop next year. I mean, otherwise, why wouldn’t the margin be similar to the high 11% like you’re seeing this year?
Dave Keffer: That high 11% margin rate is predicated on a certain volume of both program performance and net EAC benefits. We're projecting a wider range currently in the mid-11s to the high 11s, because it's tough to project, as Kathy noted earlier, with too much specificity given the macro environment we're in today. Our program performance continues to be exceptional. But we think today, the appropriate outlook is about 20 basis points lower margin rate next year with continuation of -- kind of the second half trends we're seeing this year in net EACs. I think that's about as specific as we can be at this point in the process, George.
George Shapiro: Okay. And then one quick one. How much contribution will GBSD and NGI beat to the $1 billion growth that you’re talking about in the Space in ‘23?
Dave Keffer: We project GBSD to be a little less than half of that growth. NGI will also be a contributor but then there are a number of other programs. The wins we've talked about this year at Space Development Agency, continued growth in the GEM63 portfolio with the Amazon Kuiper expansion there. There are a number of drivers of growth across our Space portfolio, both national security, civilian and otherwise.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.
Seth Seifman: Kathy and Dave, I know you are just in the early stages of 2023, so sorry to bring up 2024 but you guys have talked about cash flow target for that year and also segment margin, I think, in the 12% range. Are you still on target for reaching those goals?
Dave Keffer: Sure. I can touch on that. As we noted today, we've continued to reaffirm our multiyear cash flow outlook. For '23, that's intact, for '24 as well. And as we noted on the call today, we expect another growth year in 2025. We'll be more specific in quantifying that on our January call when we'll do our typical update of the multiyear quantified free cash flow outlook. And so continued strength in the expected returns from the business. We'll update the specific numbers there based on Section 174 legislation status in January. On the margin rate side, as we noted, we were operating at that 12% level in the first half of this year. Businesses continued to execute well and mitigate broader macroeconomic challenges. We're anticipating about that 20 basis points of decline based on what we currently see in 2023. We do anticipate longer-term recovery. It's tough at this stage of the game to project whether that recovery back to the high 11s and the 12% level occurs as soon as 2024 or whether it's subsequent to that, a lot of that will depend on the pace of recovering these macroeconomic factors. But again, critically, the sales growth expansion we see next year, the acceleration of the 4% to 5% range, multiyear free cash flow guidance remaining intact, I think, is indicative of the kind of economic value we're delivering even in this environment.
Seth Seifman: Great. And just as a quick follow-up, with the supply chain challenges lingering into 2023 and probably lessening through the year, should we expect a similar distribution of sales throughout the year in ‘23 that we’ve seen in ‘22 in terms of the percentage per quarter?
Dave Keffer: It's premature for me to give you a percentage by quarter at this stage. We're doing our best to give you our latest insights into the full year outlook. Some of that quarterly profile ends up being determined by the timing of material receipts on large programs and across the business space. So give us a few more months to give you a quarterly profile. We'll certainly do so. We'll give you more insights on that in January as we typically do.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ken Herbert with RBC Capital Markets.
Ken Herbert: Kathy, relative to – or Dave, relative to the initial expectations in the year, you’ve seen stronger bookings that you’ve called out as we’ve gone through the year. And I’m just wondering, if you can parse that out a little bit. I know you called out share gains but how much of that has been share gains versus maybe an acceleration or timing around contracts? And how much should we sort of read through or think about maybe an expanded opportunity set for you heading into ‘23 based on some of the stronger bookings this year?
Kathy Warden: Thanks for the question. When we look at the portfolio, it has been broad-based in terms of the improvement that we've seen in our expectations for book-to-bill. All 4 segments now projecting over 1. And it has been most pronounced in Space, where we've called out some specific opportunities that were competitive. So to your point, taking share that we were able to secure that we may not have anticipated winning as many of those as we started the year as we ultimately have. We feel that we are in a good position with backlog in each of the businesses going into 2023, supporting the accelerated growth that we've laid out in our outlook for next year. We don't expect that our book-to-bill next year will be as robust as it was this year, because we do have quite a bit of backlog that we will be carrying into the year and the opportunities that is not as strong in 2023 but we do see then that picking up again in '24 and '25. So I would tell you, we tend not to look at awards on a single year basis and calculate book-to-bill only on a single year. We look at it on a running basis and our system is strong, as an aggregate over the last 3 years, we expect that to continue well into the future.
Ken Herbert: That’s helpful. And as you think about the strength – the comment you just made on strength in the ‘24, would that be more on the Space side within Space or maybe more on the Launch and Missile side, or any color on that would be helpful?
Kathy Warden: For Space, we've seen broad-based opportunities across both Launch and Missiles as well as our Space segment and we expect that to continue, there are multiple programs that will be selected for next phase and be awarded in that time frame in both elements of our Space business.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Scott Deuschle with Credit Suisse.
Scott Deuschle: Anything you can say about the equipment sales that impacted Q3 free cash flow? Is that similar in nature to the large equipment sales that AS booked a while back?
Dave Keffer: It is actually cash flow associated with that equipment sale booked a while back. So it is the timing of payments driving a particular cash receipt this quarter but it is fully associated with the equipment sale you noted from the past.
Scott Deuschle: Okay. Got it. And then, Kathy, just on NGI. Is it reasonable to think that you might be able to offer some cost savings to your customer there, if there’s product commonality between the Interceptor and then the GBSD booster? And would you potentially design for commonality there in order to drive that cost benefit to the customer?
Kathy Warden: Well, it's an excellent question. And because we're in an active competition, I won't speak too much about our approach. But what I would say is that we constantly look for ways to deliver more value to the customer based on a broad set of capabilities, both in the case of Interceptors as well as our Missile Defense portfolio which I've noted, has been growing and we expect it to continue to grow. Taking a full mission understanding of the threat environment as it evolves and bringing it back into our product development strategy is key across the entire portfolio but NGI will also benefit from that level of expertise that we have with the threat, the solution elements and submission.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of David Strauss with Barclays.
David Strauss: Kathy, F-35 cuts across a number of your businesses. I think you’ve talked about it being 10% of sales in total. Can you give us an idea of what you’ve got baked in for F-35 in total in 2023 from a – I assume, it’s declining a bit with DAS rolling off and so on? But can you give us an idea of what’s baked in for F-35 in ‘23? And whether as you look beyond ‘23, F-35 stabilizes or maybe even begins to grow again?
Kathy Warden: Well, David, actually, when we look across the entirety of the company, F-35 is pretty flat going into 2023. So we have a lot of moving parts, as you indicated. In Aerospace, we have volume that is fairly consistent in our case. Because remember, we build a couple of years, about 18 months ahead of Lockheed Martin. And so we are maxing out at our limitations of capacity for building center fuselages. And so that project flattish into 2023, as Dave noted earlier. But in our Mission Systems side of the business, while we have DAS which is being replaced with new product insertion. We're also working on new products insertion in the other elements of the portfolio. So we have some development work going on in Block 4 that continues to grow and production there, too, is fairly stable as we look out over this time period and sustainment is growing. So when you take all of those elements across the entirety of our portfolio, F-35 is pretty flat going into 2023 and we expect to be relatively flat going into 2024, maybe a little bit of upside to that.
David Strauss: All right. Perfect. That’s very helpful. And then on the – back on the margin guide for next year. Would you characterize the drop, I guess, before I think we were all thinking kind of flattish next year and then maybe improving a bit in ‘24. Would you characterize the lower guide, is that more mix related? Maybe your lower margin programs are accelerating faster than you had expected? Or is this inflation related or some combination of both?
Dave Keffer: I would say, it's a combination of all of those factors but leaning more towards the macro factors. This is a unique environment that we're all operating in these days and we're eyes wide open to the continuation of a lot of those pressures in 2023. And that's why we think it's not a huge impact but call it, 20 basis points compared to the high levels we've been operating at in 2022. I think importantly, as you get down to the earnings per share line, excluding the noncash pension element of it, we anticipate EPS growth faster than even the 4% to 5% accelerated sales growth. So we're managing through these times, I think, particularly well when you think about the pace of EPS acceleration as well.
Todd Ernst: All right. We're going to have to leave it there. I will give one more. All right. We’ll leave it there. I’ll turn it over to Kathy for closing remarks.
Kathy Warden: Thanks, Todd. Look, before concluding today's call, I'd just like to take a moment to thank our entire team for another strong quarter in what we have appropriately characterized this challenging macroeconomic time. So business fundamentals for Northrop Grumman remain incredibly strong and that's due to the work of this entire team. But I want to especially think 1 of our team members, Mary Petryszyn, who will be retiring from Northrop Grumman in January. She has provided 10 years of outstanding service to our company, most recently as the Defense Systems front and we wish her the very best. On October 17, I'm sure you all noted that Roshan Roeder became our new President of Defense Systems. She is an experienced executive in our company. I'm very confident in her ability to take the business to the next level and I look forward to introducing her to many of you. So, thank you for joining our call today. I expect to see many of you in the coming months. But for those, I don’t see, let me wish you a healthy and happy holiday season and we look forward to talking to you in January.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. Have a great day.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-07-28 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Northrop Grumman's Second Quarter 2022 Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. My name is Victor and I will be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Todd Ernst, Treasurer and Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Ernst, please proceed.
Todd Ernst: Thank you, Victor and good morning, everyone and welcome to Northrop Grumman's second quarter 2022 conference call. We'll refer to a PowerPoint presentation that is posted to our IR web page this morning. Before we start, matters discussed on today's call, including 2022 guidance and beyond, including our outlooks reflect the company's judgment based on information available at the time of this call. They constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which are noted in today's press release and in our SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties may cause actual company results to differ materially. Today's call will include non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to our GAAP results in our earnings release. On the call today are Kathy Warden, our Chair, CEO and President; and David Keffer, our CFO. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kathy. Kathy?
Kathy Warden: Thanks, Todd. Good morning, everyone and thank you again for joining us. I'd like to start today's call by highlighting the James Webb space telescope and the incredible images released just a few weeks ago. This extraordinary telescope represents countless Northrop Grumman engineers, technicians, scientists and cross-functional teams working in partnership with NASA for over 2 decades. In addition to leading the industry team, we designed and built the deployable Sun Shield, provided the spacecraft, develop the Observatory subsystems and integrated the total system. The advanced technology we've created and the images it captures will inspire the next generation of innovators and scientists and we believe will be one of Webb's many legacies. Webb exemplifies the defining characteristic of our business strategy to develop and produce innovative technology solutions to address our customers' toughest challenges. This strategy differentiates us and aligns our portfolio with our customers' priorities. And as a result, we strengthened our position in the market. As a reminder, the 4 core focus areas of our strategy are technology leadership, sustainably and profitably growing our business, keeping a laser focus on performance and deploying capital in value-creating ways. This strategy continues to yield results. In the second quarter, we saw strong demand across our businesses with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.48, driven by awards for F-35, GEM 63 and restricted programs. All of our businesses had a book-to-bill ratio above 1 in the quarter, driving a 6% sequential increase in our backlog which now totals $80 billion. Given this backlog growth and our continued alignment to customers' budgets and priorities, we are even more confident we can accelerate our revenue in 2023 from the low single digits we're guiding this year. In the quarter, we did experience certain challenges from the broader macroeconomic environment, including a tight labor market and supply chain delays which impacted sales timing. However, we're pleased with the progress our team continues to make in addressing these challenges and hiring trends improved as we progressed through the second quarter, laying the foundation for sales growth in the second half of the year. As our business grows, we remain focused on performance and driving cost efficiencies across the business. This continued focus contributed to another quarter of solid margin performance. Our segment OM rate was a robust 12.2% in Q2 and stands at 12% year-to-date. Dave will cover further details of our quarterly results and guidance update momentarily but first, I'd like to touch on some highlights from the quarter. The technology developed for James Webb is one example of Northrop Grumman's innovation. Another example is how we are using technology to produce innovative and affordable solutions for our customers. To that end, we're investing in digital design capabilities and advanced manufacturing facilities. In close partnership with our customers, we are digitally transforming how we design, test and manufacture the next generation of systems. And you've heard our customers acknowledge the results. particularly with some of the largest programs, including B-21 and GBSD. We are marrying our world-class engineering talent with the latest digital tools, machine learning and agile principles. And as we announced this quarter, we are also investing in factories of the future, including our state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in West Virginia which will incorporate the latest in digital manufacturing, automation and modular work sells. Once operational in 2024, this facility will support production of up to 600 strike missiles per year, optimizing quality and reducing cost and cycle time as well as bolstering tactical weapon supply chain capacity for our customers. For the last few years, we've taken an enterprise-wide approach in mission-focused areas that are aligned with our customers' priorities. These are areas where we see opportunity to leverage our technology know-how and our domain expertise and high capabilities from across our businesses. Today, I want to highlight a few of them and the related results we've seen so far this year. One example of this is in national security space. Our customers have made it clear that space underpins many missions vital to our national security. And we recognize that we need to think about space differently as a rapidly evolving contested domain. Given this, our focus is on providing space based offerings that include a mix of exquisite solutions in combination with proliferated constellations of low earth orbit satellites, also known as LEO which together create a more resilient architecture. We've recently seen the benefits of this approach. For example, after the close of the second quarter, we received a $617 million contract for the SDA tracking layer which is a LEO constellation of 14 satellites designed to provide global warning, tracking and targeting of advanced missile threats, including hypersonic missiles. This builds on the SDA transport layer contract we were awarded in February which is also a LEO constellation of 42 satellites, providing resilience, low latency, high volume data transport in support of U.S. military missions around the world. In addition to these, we booked another $700 million in Q2 in restricted space awards and now have $11.3 billion of restricted space backlog. We continue to see the national security space area as one of the strongest growth drivers for our company. Another focus area where we are pulling capability and expertise from across the portfolio is missile defense and Counter Hypersonics. In the second quarter, we were awarded a contract from the Missile Defense Agency to continue development of the glide phase interceptor program. GPI will play a central role in ensuring the United States maintains the most reliable and advanced missile defense systems capable of outpacing and defeating evolving missile threats. This complements our missile defense modernization work already underway on NGI, HBTSS and IBCS. We have also been supporting international customers to modernize their missile defense system. For example, last week, we delivered the first of the 6 production IBCS engagement operation centers for Poland's medium-range air and missile defense system. Our capital deployment approach is also an important part of the strategy I just laid out for you. Our first priority is to invest in executing our business strategy. By investing in our factories, digital design tools and our people who are a key source of our technology leadership, we are creating long-term sustainable value. We also remain committed to returning at least 100% of free cash flow to shareholders this year. In the second quarter, we increased our dividend by 10%, marking our 19th consecutive annual increase. Our new quarterly dividend will be nearly double the level we paid in the beginning of 2017. We are also returning capital to shareholders through stock repurchases and we continue to target at least $1.5 billion in repurchases this year. Before Dave shares more details about our financial results, I'd like to briefly talk about the defense demand environment. We've seen a fundamental shift in global commitment of resources for defense and national security, particularly in Europe. Just this year, we've seen Finland and Sweden progress their membership in NATO and many European countries increase or state their plans to increase their defense budget. The geopolitical environment has highlighted an increased requirement for defense and deterrent. In the U.S., this has also resulted in strong bipartisan support for defense spending. Recently, the Congressional Arm Services Committee has marked up their version of the FY '23 defense bill with both providing bipartisan support for further increases in defense spending above the president budget. For Northrop Grumman, the U.S. FY '23 base defense budget request included strong support for key programs like T21, GBSD, NGI, IBCS, next-generation OPIR and Triton. And there is an opportunity for additional funding for GATOR, E-2D, F-35 and F-18 that we've seen in proposed plus ups from Congress. But I will note that as has become the norm in recent years, there is a high probability of starting the fiscal year on a CR, so we have anticipated this in our outlook for 2022. The budget is a strong reflection of the alignment of our company with our customers and reinforces my confidence that we are well positioned for this environment. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Dave and then I'll have a few closing remarks before we turn to Q&A. Dave?
Dave Keffer: Okay. Thanks, Kathy and good morning, everyone. Overall, this was another solid quarter with similar themes to Q1. Near-term supply side pressures and a tight labor market have persisted but the demand environment continues to be quite strong with outstanding awards and backlog growth, driven by alignment with our customers' highest priorities, setting the stage for longer-term success. We generated $13 billion of new awards in the second quarter, a higher volume than we had expected due to excellent competitive wins and timing of a few large awards, including the latest F-35 block in our aeronautics sector. Our year-to-date book-to-bill is now 1.22, as a result of our strong bookings, we now expect award volume to be approximately equal to sales for the full year, higher than our previous projections. While these new business metrics position us for growth going forward, our Q2 sales of $8.8 billion and first half sales in total came in slightly below our expectations as we continue to manage through global supply chain and labor market challenges. These first half results and current trends point toward a full year sales outlook near the low end of our guidance range. with Q3 sales slightly over $9 billion and Q4 in the mid-$9 billion. These figures represent much stronger year-over-year growth in the second half than the first, requiring continued expansion in headcount and material receipts. In Q2, we drove incremental improvements in hiring as the quarter progressed, adding nearly 1,000 net employees in Q2 after being down slightly in Q1. Our material receipts forecast is also weighted toward the second half of the year based on timing of program demand. These factors, along with our growing backlog provides the foundation for faster revenue growth rates in the second half of the year and we expect that momentum to continue into 2023. Even with temporal top line headwinds, our execution remained strong in the quarter. Segment margins were 12.2%, in line with the high level from Q2 of last year, driving cost efficiencies and keeping a laser focus on performance are key elements of our strategy. These will be particularly important efforts in a higher inflationary environment than we've experienced in recent years. It starts by negotiating good business terms and delivering strong program performance but it doesn't end there. It also includes driving affordability in our rates, having a disciplined approach to risk management and optimizing our cost structure. For example, in the quarter, we sold a property in Bethpage, New York and recognized a $38 million gain. Continuing with our Q2 results, diluted earnings per share in the quarter were $6.06, down 6% compared to the second quarter of last year. EPS was lower, largely due to non-operational items, unfavorable returns on our marketable securities and lower net pension income contributed headwinds of $0.60 compared to Q2 of last year. And while our 17.7% tax rate was lower than last year, it was above Q1 and our full year expectation for 2022. Turning to full year guidance. I'll start with a few updates to our sector estimates. Our Space business continues to deliver excellent sales growth and bookings, including another quarter of record backlog, demonstrating the diversity of capabilities that we bring to market. As a result, we're again increasing its sales guidance to the high $11 billion range. At DS, we're tweaking our full year expectations to the mid-$5 billion based on a slower ramp on certain programs as well as broader staffing challenges. For operating margin rate, we are increasing our estimates at AS, DS and MS based on their strong year-to-date results. Offsetting these increases are a reduction in the space OM rate to approximately 10% based on better-than-expected success in winning new development programs. And at the company level, we're maintaining our full year guidance ranges for sales, segment margin rate, EPS and cash. Within those ranges, we currently expect that any softness in sales is likely to be offset by margin strength. Embedded in our earnings per share outlook are a few moving pieces. First, our corporate unallocated costs are now projected to be $210 million, down $60 million from our prior estimates. This is due to favorable state tax trends and other lower corporate expenses. We're also projecting modestly lower net interest expense. Offsetting these benefits is an unfavorable impact from our marketable securities that we've experienced year-to-date. There are no incremental mark-to-market impacts assumed in our guidance for the second half of the year. As we noted last quarter regarding corporate unallocated costs, we continue to project a onetime spike in state taxes recognized in the quarter in which the R&D tax amortization law is deferred. With respect to cash, second quarter free cash flow was an outflow of $460 million. Absent the cash taxes paid associated with R&D amortization, our free cash flow would have been roughly breakeven compared with the high hundreds of millions of dollars in an average Q2. A good portion of this delta was due to several large program collections expected toward the end of Q2 that were instead collected in Q3, including about $300 million collected on the first working day of July. The seasonality of our collections and disbursements is such that the second half of the year is expected to generate much stronger cash flows than the first. But as always, we'll need to keep our focus on execution and drive further working capital efficiencies to offset any ongoing timing issues and achieve our outlook. Our guidance continues to include 2 scenarios: 1 based on current tax law and the deferral scenario predicated on receiving refunds for payments made to date. Next, I wanted to take a moment to talk about our pension plans. Last quarter, I mentioned that while our pension plans contribute a component of our GAAP earnings, the FAS/CAS income is non-operational and not something we consider when assessing the company's performance. Slide 11 in our earnings deck provides an illustration of the pension headwind on GAAP earnings that we've experienced so far this year. As we look toward next year, we would expect this headwind to grow based on recent volatility in the financial markets. Year-to-date, our asset performance has been below our long-term expected rate of return and discount rates have had a historic rise. Of course, our pension plans aren't unique in experiencing these macroeconomic trends. If we snap the line at quarter end, these market conditions would translate to a significantly lower net pension income going forward, primarily in the nonoperating FAS pension line. Partially offsetting this GAAP earnings headwind would be a modest increase in projected CAS recoveries but our required cash contributions would remain very low for the next several years and our funded status remains healthy at over 96%. So while the GAAP earnings impact could be a headwind, from a cash or economic perspective, the changes would be modestly favorable. A lot can change in the financial markets over the course of the year, so we'll wait to provide more specific multiyear projections until later in the year. I'd point you to the pension sensitivity table that we provided in our January earnings deck for your modeling purposes. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to you, Kathy.
Kathy Warden: Thanks, Dave. So in summary, demand remains robust and we saw outstanding bookings and backlog growth in the quarter and year-to-date. This demand is creating momentum that supports our expectation for accelerating growth for the remainder of this year and into next. Additionally, our capital deployment strategy is aimed at supporting long-term growth and creating value for our shareholders. We believe the investments we are making today in digital tools and factories of the future are already enabling stronger program performance and contributing to our operating results. So I'm incredibly proud of the Northrop Grumman team as we execute our strategy and position the company for long-term success. So with that, we're ready for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Ron Epstein from Bank of America.
Mariana Perez: This is Mariana Perez Mora on for Ron today. So on labor. Most of the industry is experiencing significant pressure from a tight labor market. And it seems that you are managing these challenges better and even seen some improvements in the second half. Could you please describe and give us some color on what are you doing to navigate these challenges?
Kathy Warden: Well, thanks, Mariana. We absolutely have seen labor headwinds in the first half. But as we noted in our comments, we are starting to see those ease in the latter part of the second quarter and even the results that we're seeing in July so far. And what we're doing is aggressively across the enterprise, working both hiring and retention efforts. It is an all-hands-on-deck strategy to ensure that people know that Northrop Grumman is growing and hiring. And we are having good success in attracting people to our company. We've also been taking actions to retain the talent that we have and that has really started to take traction.  I will also say that the market conditions play a significant role in any company's ability to hire and retain -- and we've seen the market conditions start to soften. You can't pick up a newspaper or read an article online these days without seeing a company that's talking about hiring freezes or even layoffs. And so that will have an impact on the labor market and we expect continued softening as a result of that in the second half which leads us to feel more confident that the second half will look more like our prepandemic experience than what we've experienced in the last 6 to 12 months.
Mariana Perez: Perfect. And then on supply chain, how -- or what kind of tools do you have to improve your visibility or material lead times? Do you have flexibility to reach out long-term agreements in advance or increasing inventories to provide any potential future disruptions?
Kathy Warden: Well, we do have those tools available to us. But what I would say is, I know you've heard from a host of manufacturing, including peers in aerospace and defense industry this week. That we're seeing longer lead times which impact timing of sales. And I believe those are a result of numerous factors but notably the labor availability we were just speaking about -- so as we noted earlier in the call, we do expect the labor market to soften a bit. And while it will still be a headwind in the second half, we don't see it being the same degree that it would be in the first half. And I'm basing this on the fact that we are deeply embedded with our suppliers. We have Northrop Grumman people on site with them. And so we believe we have a good handle on material timing delivery for the rest of the year and we've incorporated that into our thinking but of course, it's based on what we know today. And as we've seen in the last 12 months, COVID flare up, component demand fluctuations and a variety of smaller issues can cost an estimating volatility and around timing of supply. So our teams are managing this well. I feel like we have done this exceptionally well in the first half. while we were slightly short of our own revenue projections for Q2 which we said would be about 24.5% at the midpoint of our guide, that was very tight estimating variability in a very challenging market. So we have very detailed reviews of material timing. We're working mitigation strategies on a daily basis and we have a handle on what we need to deliver in the second half. Dave, anything you would add?
Dave Keffer: I think that's well characterized, Kathy, at a program level, in addition to being confident in our ability to deliver more in the second half, the timing of demand is also more weighted toward the second half of this year as opposed to last year when the demand timing at a program level happened to be a bit more weighted toward the first half of the year. So that too contributes to the stronger year-over-year growth outlook for the second half of this year.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Richard Safran from Seaport Global.
Richard Safran: So, I wanted to ask you about the news, the FTC is making about Orbital. You probably were expecting this, at least I would guess. This was initially brought out when Lockheed was buying Aerojet. So I want to know if you could briefly talk to the issues that the FTC is focusing on. If you could discuss what the range of outcomes might be? And I know it's always a bit difficult but if you could speculate on the impact. Any comment you would give there would be appreciated.
Kathy Warden: Yes. Thanks, Rich. So let me start by providing some context on the issue. We announced our intent to acquire Orbital ATK in 2018 and the Department of Defense and FTC spent many months looking at the pro-competitive aspects of the deals, of which there are many and any anticompetitive risk before they approve the deal. And so during this period, the government identified only 1 concern and it was around solid rocket motors. And so we agreed to a consent order to address that concern. Over the past 4 years, we've executed an extensive compliance program and worked with the government very closely in line with the terms of the order. So we believe we've been and we continue to be in compliance with the order. The FTC did raise 1 matter. They were investigating a few years ago. But to our knowledge, that investigation has not concluded. And we've shared the -- this in our 10-K and 10-Q filings. So you can refer to those for the details of that particular matter. And now to the point of your question, I know there's been some recent speculation both on the status of that investigation and a broad range of possible next steps that the government might attempt to take. But I'll say that we don't see merit or precedent for most of those scenarios. And we continue to maintain that we don't believe this matter will have a material adverse impact to our company. So I won't speculate on what the size will be because we believe it could be 0 and certainly isn't material.
Richard Safran: Okay, that helps. As a quick follow-up here. On your comments about international, I want to know if you could expand a little bit on that. What type of equipment are you getting the most interest for? Could you discuss a little bit about the timing, how that's going to translate to the -- and flow into the P&L. And then just look a bit old school here with increasing international demand, we should expect more higher-margin commercial contract? I just want to know if that's -- if you think that's the case?
Dave Keffer: Thanks, Rich. This is Dave. I'll take that one. We've gotten a lot of questions in the last few months given the evolving geopolitical global situation about near-term impact. I think the reality is in a business as long cycle as ours, these things take time to have an impact. And we are certainly engaged with U.S. and international customers talking about areas of particular demand -- we mentioned products like IBCS on the call today. I would say mission areas like missile defense or a particular international interest, as you'd expect. But it will take time for those things to have a financial impact. And so I'd hesitate to project in any specifics what that may be in the near term. It's something we'll keep you apprised of over the next several years as those opportunities become reality.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned from Bernstein.
Doug Harned: When you look at Aeronautics, this has been complicated given a lot of mature programs ramping down B-21 going up F-35 but in Q2, if we take out the land sale gain, margins were well below 10%, revenues were low as well which really -- it looks like it makes H2 pretty challenging. Can you talk about how you see the path to guidance in H2?
Dave Keffer: Sure, I'm happy to touch on that one, Doug. In the first quarter, we had an unusually high volume of favorable net EACs in the second quarter net EACs were light. This is the typical nature of a business like Aeronautics, where there is quarterly fluctuation. But in aggregate, we have even a slightly stronger outlook for the year, as we described earlier on the margin rate side than we did previously. So you need to look through and look past quarterly fluctuations in net EACs and toward the overall outlook. On the sales side, that net EAC fluctuation rolls through sales as well. And so I'd note that it was relatively stable in the first and second quarter. AS is another business, as we described earlier in our comments where we see a higher volume of material receipts projected in the second half than the first. And so I think, a reasonable second half ramp from where we are today and very consistent with the projections we've been providing for a couple of quarters now.
Doug Harned: And well, as a follow-up, if I switch over to space, I mean your backlog there is now $39 billion. I mean it's a huge backlog. And I know you've got some pretty good revenue growth forecast here. But how should we look at the conversion of that backlog in terms of timing? How should we see that conversion move to revenues over the years here?
Dave Keffer: Sure. We're -- as you mentioned, we're incredibly pleased with the backlog growth, the award volume that we've had in space programs like both the transport and tracking layers of the FDA architecture are great examples there of work we're doing, really at multiple layers with multiple products supporting multiple mission areas in the national security and civilian space markets. In terms of how that backlog then breaks down in terms of award volume over time -- or sales volume over time, it's been our fastest-growing business and we anticipate that it will continue to be our fastest-growing business and not just any 1 program, GBSD is obviously a large contributor to its growth last year and this year. But the growth is much broader based. And so while GBSD has grown about $0.5 billion in our '22 estimates and should show similar growth in '23, we would anticipate a similar volume of growth outside of GBSD going forward. and our growth outside of GBSD for this year is actually exceeding GBSD's growth on a dollar basis in space. So really broad-based outstanding growth, not just in backlog but to your point in converting to sales as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr from Cowen.
Cai von Rumohr: Yes. So you and your partner on MGI were selected for the glide phase interceptor that's an interceptor, NGI is an interceptor. Are there any read acrosses in terms of having one list that would make you better positioned for NGI if it goes sole source? And what do you think the chances are it goes to all source?
Kathy Warden: So Cai, a very insightful question as always. And I would say that certainly, it is beneficial to be supporting multiple like missions and understanding, therefore, how these systems can draw from a common technology base. Given both are in competition I won't say anything more than that and I'm sure you respect that. In terms of what does this mean more broadly, I would simply say that missile defense is an area of great importance, not only in the U.S. but internationally. And as I outlined in my comments, we're taking a broad enterprise approach to thinking about how we best spring the capabilities of Northrop Grumman to bear on all of these opportunities. And so we feel we're positioned well to support what the government needs. I do think there is a balanced view, however, that we need a broad industrial days in all of our missile defense programs. And so I expect that there is some appetite to carry forward multiple providers for longer as we are seeing in NGI that down-select won't happen until 2025 likely and to your point, may extend even further or go sole-source. And we think that is supportive of Northrop Grumman growth no matter how it goes. And we just support the government in making those decisions about what's best for their industrial base capacity.
Cai von Rumohr: And secondly, you also had a number of wins you alluded to in the LEO area. Can you -- as you look at the second half, are there any major opportunities we should keep our eye on competitive bids?
Kathy Warden: There are a few, mostly what we see in the second half of new awards. And as Dave pointed out, we do expect now book to bill to be close to one which is improvement over our outlook at the beginning of the year because we've been having more success in competitive awards like the 2 I mentioned with FDA than we had anticipated. But as we look to the second half of the year, not as much competitive to be awarded more sole source to see about $1.5 billion of new awards in restricted within AS about the same in states. We do have a fairly significant competitive award that we're expecting any day in space, it's in the $1 billion class and then a lot of smaller things that add up to our full year expectation of close to one book to bill.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Kristine Liwag from Morgan Stanley.
Kristine Liwag: You mentioned earlier that there's been a fundamental shift in U.S. and European support for defense spending. And historically, when the economic environment is weaker and other federal budgets emerge defense budgets have come under pressure. So what's different this time? And how long do you think the support for defense will persist?
Kathy Warden: Thanks for the question, Kristine. I was just in Europe a few weeks ago. And I would say that I see truly a fundamental shift in recognizing the threat environment is real and it's now, right? I think in recent years, within Europe, there's been a sense that we're working toward a longer-term threat horizon and perhaps the pacing of national and defense security spending would have been appropriate in that environment but the fact that the threat is more imminent is addressed in what you're seeing is planned or committed increases in defense spending across most of the European nations. That does take several years so to translate into specific needs, by plan and sales for companies like ours. So I do expect that there might be some modulation based on broader economic factors and other spending priorities. But I don't see there being another inflection point back to a view that defense spending isn't a high priority. So I just see it fairly ensuring.
Kristine Liwag: And as a follow-up, how much urgency is there from your conversations with the customers to address the security landscape? And when do you think these demand signals might translate to revenue growth?
Kathy Warden: Yes. So as I noted, despite the urgency, it does take generally at least 18 to 24 months to translate intent into specific programs aspirations, customer wanting to buy x quantity of certain systems in production. And it takes even a little longer if it's something that is not in production if it's a developmental program. And so that can be 3, 4, 5 years. So as I think about the landscape in Europe, obviously, the time is now to be advising and insights on what can address their highest priority demands just as we do with U.S. customers but I don't see it having a material impact on revenues for us or other AMC companies in the next 18 months. So I'd say it's more in the 2024 time horizon that we would look forward to have a more material impact.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rob Stallard from Vertical.
Robert Stallard: Kathy, I just like to follow up actually on the question I asked you 3 months ago about inflation and fixed price contracts. I was wondering how things have evolved over the last quarter versus your expectations? And whether you are making any structural changes to the way you do business, considering we are in this higher inflation environment?
Kathy Warden: Yes, good question. So I would -- our today view is very much in line with what it was in the first quarter and we certainly are not immune to impacts of inflation. So we're working with the government to quantify those impacts and work with them to mitigate them. And this includes ensuring that appropriate funding is available for the government program managers to acquire the system needed to support national defense in this inflationary environment. And to that end, we're very pleased to see that Congress is including funding to offset inflation in their FY '23 budget markup. There are some structural characteristics of our business that naturally mitigate some of these impacts. Dave talked about the importance of deal structure. These are things like our mix of cost plus work versus fixed price, the relatively short contract duration of our fixed price contracts that allow us to renegotiate based on current conditions within 1 to 2 years and in some cases, escalation clauses that allow us to reprice. As we are looking now at new deals that we're entering we are being more forceful in including those escalation clauses in our contract terms, making sure that we're matching our supplier terms with our overall contract terms as some examples of what we're doing differently to mitigate the impact. And then we also, within our organization are working to offset the impact. So this includes managing supply chain affordability, looking at second suppliers where we feel suppliers are not addressing affordability, reducing costs in our own areas of overhead costs, including the real estate footprint as we noted earlier today, so while inflation is something that we are managing on a daily basis, I would say we haven't seen a material impact to our financials so far this year but we have to continue to be diligent to make sure that it doesn't become an impact. And we're watching very closely to see if inflation is starting to modulate. Our indications would be that, that is starting to happen but we're watching the data just as you are.
Robert Stallard: Okay. And then just a quick follow-up. There was a news report yesterday that the Air Force is looking to retire all its Global Hawks in, I think, 2027. I think is this in line with your expectations?
Kathy Warden: It is and this is what we've been talking about for a while that the Global Hawk franchise would be phased out over time. And we -- yes, we were expecting this. And as you note, the Block 40s don't retire until 2027. So that's a bit out in the future and doesn't have an impact on any projections that we've outlined for this year or next but it is in line with our longer-term expectations.
Operator: Our next question from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Maybe if we could just talk about the F-35 program, Kathy. How big is it today? And given some of the reset on production, how does that impact the cadence and outlook for Northrop? And what are some of the puts and takes just thinking about shifts on content and lead times within Mission versus AS.
Kathy Warden: So Sheila, it continues to be about 10% of our annual sales in total across all aspects of our contribution to the program. As we have worked through our new contract for Lot 15 through 17, we have factored in the demand that Lockheed has for our components and we still see our outlook for '22 and even into '23 intact as a result of the new expectations around demand. As we look over a longer period of time, we still see production being the lion's share of our revenue volume. The sustainment is the fastest-growing element of our contribution to the program. And in Mission Systems, we have a combination of development and production because we're supporting the Block IV upgrades. And that most notably is revenue support for Mission Systems even as we phase out of the DAS program which also is in Mission Systems. We see Mission Systems revenue being fairly stable because of that increased volume around Block IV.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Great. And then maybe just a follow-up. You had some positive movement IBC, I think, first deliveries to Poland in the quarter. Maybe if you could remind us how you're sizing that program and timing to the Army versus other potential international opportunities.
Dave Keffer: Sure. Happy to jump in on that one, Sheila. In aggregate, that you can think of that franchise in the 1% of sales range. But as you point out, they are important domestic and international components to that today and equally importantly, international opportunity going forward as well. Certainly, it's a critical mission set that our IBCS capability can meet by attaching a kind of previously disconnected sensors and shooters and bringing new capability to disparate systems which is really central to the modern mission set, both domestically and abroad. So we look for that to be a growing franchise. We're really pleased with the competitive awards of the past year. There should be some second half growth in the program. And again, it's a critical part of our Defense Systems franchise.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Strauss from Barclays.
David Strauss: Kathy, I think on the last call, you kind of endorsed the current consensus revenue estimate for 2023 which I think is around $38 billion. Is that still the right way to think about the revenue trajectory next year? And it would seem like you would be able to get there pretty much on B-21 and GBSD growth. So are you assuming, what does the rest of the portfolio look like next year ex B-21 and GBSD in terms of growth?
Kathy Warden: So we continue to believe we can accelerate our growth rate next year toward the mid-single-digit range which is how consensus is being developed. And so it would affirm that. And the demand environment is strong, as I outlined on the call. So that would provide some tailwinds. However, I would caution you just as I am thinking about this as we prepare to give you outlook and trends in October when we'll provide more detail that the supply side challenges that we are facing this year are real. And it depends on how they mitigate throughout the second half as to what that looks like going into 2023 and we certainly could be delivering higher revenue growth this year, if not for those supply side constraints. So it really isn't a demand question. And to your point, the budgets are strong enough for us to have even further accelerated growth into 2023 but we need to be able to deliver on that growth with the labor and the materials. And so we're monitoring that very closely and we'll have a better sense of what that looks like in October to be able to give you trends data into 2023.
David Strauss: Okay. And Dave, thanks for the color on pension. Obviously with you guys, a lot of moving pieces with the mark-to-market and all of that. I think you had previously said FAS has relatively, I think, in total, relatively flat in '23 versus '22. I mean are based on more things today, I mean, can you help us at all? Are we looking at like a couple of hundred million dollar headwind '23 versus '22.
Dave Keffer: I appreciate you raising that topic for a follow-up. We noted on the call that we direct your attention to the pension sensitivity slide we provide every January. So to give you a feel for the approximate impacts of an increase or decrease in a discount rate or a level of asset returns of a certain degree. The discount rate increase is the most significant effect that we would see on FAS/CAS income if the year were to end today, we've seen well over 100, perhaps even approaching 200 basis points of discount rate increase since the year began. And so as we noted in that sensitivity slide, every 25 basis points can have $1 billion or more impact on mark-to-market at the end of the year and a substantial impact on the FAS/CAS income going forward. Again, these are nonoperating GAAP earnings amounts. They're not cash flow drivers. If anything, as we noted, the CAS reimbursements are expected to tick up slightly. And so from an economic perspective, there's a small benefit there. From a GAAP earnings perspective, would draw your attention to the discount rate and asset return sensitivities. And of course, we'll see where the market moves over the next 6 months to give you a more final sense of the '23 FAS/CAS outlook.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Seth Seifman from JPMorgan.
Seth Seifman: Maybe just to keep everyone riveted, I'll ask a follow-up question on pension. And Dave, I wonder if you could talk about just thinking big picture and conceptually, we've seen Lockheed and their defined benefit plan and they're offloading a lot of their liability on to insurance companies. You guys still have DB. It's not huge. I think the service cost this year should be under $400 million. But when you think about what you want to do longer term, what makes most sense for Northrop, particularly as a government contractor and with the allowable cost framework, what do you want to do long term?
Dave Keffer: Sure. Thanks, Seth. So I would point out a few things. One, we've had outstanding returns on our pension assets over any period you look at historically, over the last 20 years, well above market return expectations. We're really proud of the value that, that has generated and the benefit that, that is both to the company and to our government customers. As a result, we are very well funded today. We talked about a 96% funded status level that fluctuates day-to-day, given market movements. But again, we're in slightly better funded position today than we were even as of the first of this year, given the changes in the interest rate environment offset by the changes in the asset returns that you'd expect. So there's a lot of moving pieces under the surface. But in aggregate, we don't today feel a burning need to make a change to our long-term strategy. It has been working. It's been a value to the company, to the participants and to the government. And as a result, it's certainly something we'll continue to assess over time. But at this point, we're pleased with asset returns over any long period of time, Pleased with the funded status that results from that and we'll continue to keep you apprised if there are any changes along the way.
Seth Seifman: Great. And then maybe to follow up, just on Aeronautics, I know you talked earlier about the kind of the absence of EACs in the quarter. I think they were a slight negative. I guess if we look back over the last several quarters. Given the size of the segment, the EACs in this segment team relatively light relative to others. What programs kind of give you visibility on that picking up in the coming years. And when we think about how margin expansion in the segment over time, how does the framework of underlying margin versus EACs play into that?
Dave Keffer: Sure. In aggregate, for a sector like AS, we would expect, in a typical year, to have a healthy underlying OM rate. And in a typical year, we would have some volume of favorable net EAC adjustments. Of course, at any given time, we don't know which programs those may come from because we've factored our risks and opportunities into our current EACs and we need to perform well and retire risks in order to drive those improvements in EACs. So I'd be reticent to be able to point to any particular program that we think will be a key or much less the key driver of EAC benefits over time. But certainly, within our restricted and unrestricted portfolios, we need to continue to execute well, drive efficiencies in every one of those programs and again, continue to have some volume of net EAC pickups on top of the healthy underlying segment OM rate in the business. It's a segment whose execution we're proud of with some critical programs and we'll look to continue to build on that.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs.
Noah Poponak: Why is there currently such a large variance between the pace of DoD budget outlay versus DoD budget authorization?
Kathy Warden: So no, I honestly don't know why. I can speculate a few things that may be happening. One, as we are seeing these supply chain constraints, contracts may just not need additional funding, so it could just be a temporal issue of timing. Another is the labor constraints that we're facing, the government faces as well. So we have seen where some just shortage of people to get work done has impacted anything from outlays to invoice payment timing but that would be speculation on my part. I can't tell you why. What I can tell you is that for Northrop Grumman, we did not see that as a factor in second quarter. We had exceptionally strong book-to-bill, as I noted, at 1.48. We have seen acquisitions staying relatively on time and awards and outlays being in line with our expectations.
Noah Poponak: Okay. Yes, it's just a strange dynamic. It's uncommon to see authorization humming along and then being pulsed up and discussions of higher in the future and then the outlays down double digits. But so for you, that's -- it's really a supply chain that's the bigger factor. And then it sounds like you think maybe it's possible that the customer knows their supply chain issue. So isn't cutting checks as fast as they normally would.
Kathy Warden: Right. Without lays, we generally see on existing programs that we let the government know when we're reaching a certain threshold of spending against the funds that they've outlaid and that will trigger them to provide the next funding increment. It could just be that many companies and programs are trailing with their timing expectation would have been. You're seeing that in the results across the industry. And so they just didn't have the need to do the outlays in the quarter. Obviously, that's a trend we all want to see reverse, because to your point, the funding is there.
Operator: Next question will come from the line of Rob Spingarn from Melius.
Robert Spingarn: In AS, you've held the revenue guide despite the pressure in the first half, as you and Dave noted earlier but the margins are coming down just slightly. And you've talked about catching up in the second half but I wanted to ask if the labor to do that is going to be a little more expensive and maybe that's what's behind the margin. And to what extent that Palmdale might be a particular labor pinch point because it does seem like you and Lockheed are competing pretty intensely out there for talent.
Kathy Warden: Let me start with the second half of the question and then Dave can join in on the first half. We are not seeing Palmdale to be more competitive than other labor market. Labor markets across the country where we're operating are all competitive. Palmdale is no different but we have been able to get the staffing there that we need to execute on our program. What we've seen more so and we talked about this towards the end of last year, particularly as it impacted the F-35 line is absenteeism that ebbs and flows with COVID has been a bigger challenge for us. So we have the workforce we need but if they aren't as productive because they aren't able to be there consistently that was creating more disruption for us. That has started to even out. Even with this latest set of COVID disruptions, we have not seen the same level of impact because we've taken some mitigating steps. The other thing that we've done in Palmdale is put our own training facility in place so that we can more quickly onboard people to our production programs. and provide them the training they need. It allows us to hire lesser skilled labor coming in. We provide the skills needed and that has opened up the pool from which we can recruit. So we aren't just taking talent from other people's production lines and vice versa. So those are some of the things that we've done and we're seeing good results.
Robert Spingarn: And very helpful. And just -- I'm sorry, I was going to just ask a high-level one, if it's okay.
Kathy Warden: Go ahead.
Robert Spingarn: I just wanted to ask you to characterize your positioning for NGAD?
Kathy Warden: Yes. So as we think about sixth-generation aircraft, we are in the process of building the first of those to B-21 and that's given us some fantastic experience and lessons that we believe we can apply to other sixth-generation aircraft. And so we're positioned as a competitor. I think our government desires to have a broad industrial base, able to prime these large opportunities as possible. And we have been clear that we are investing and building our own capabilities and capacities to be able to be a contender.
Todd Ernst: I have to leave it there this morning. Kathy, turn it over to you for closing remarks.
Kathy Warden: Great. Thanks, Todd and thank you all for joining our call today. I again want to acknowledge the extraordinary accomplishments by our team already this year and the momentum that I feel is creating for the future. So I hope each of you enjoy the remainder of your summer and we look forward to speaking with you in October. Thanks again.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Everyone, have a great day.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-04-28 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Northrop Grumman’s First Quarter 2022 Conference Call. Today’s call is being recorded. My name is Renz, and I will be your operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Todd Ernst, Treasurer and Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Ernst, please proceed.
Todd Ernst: Thanks, Renz. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Northrop Grumman’s first quarter 2022 conference call. We’ll refer to a PowerPoint presentation that is posted on our IR website this morning. Before we start, matters discussed on today’s call, including 2022 guidance and beyond, including outlooks reflect the company’s judgment based on information available at the time of this call. They constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which are noted in today’s press release and our SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties may cause actual company results to differ materially. Today’s call will include non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to our GAAP results in our earnings release. On the call today are Kathy Warden, our Chair, CEO and President; and Dave Keffer, our CFO. At this time, I’d like to turn the call over to Kathy. Kathy?
Kathy Warden: Thanks, Todd. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We’ve seen significant changes to the geopolitical landscape since our last earnings call. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has consequences for the stability of the region, in addition to creating a profound humanitarian crisis. Our thoughts are with the people of Ukraine as they defend their freedom and protect their way of life. Through the Northrop Grumman Foundation, we are committing aid to help the people of Ukraine, including matching our employees’ personal donations to select charitable organizations. This situation underscores the importance of having strong defensive capabilities to deter broader aggression and contain global conflicts. At Northrop Grumman, we’ve worked to ensure our country and its allies have these deterrent capabilities. Modern deterrence depends on our customer’s ability to maintain advantage over competitors in multiple domains from under sea to space and cyberspace and every domain in between. Northrop Grumman continues to demonstrate our ability to bring deterrent solutions to a more complicated world through unique capabilities in areas such as stealth, cyber, space, computing, propulsion, and communications to name a few. I’ll talk more specifically about our capabilities and our strategy in a few moments. But first, let’s address the budget trends we see in light of this threat environment. In the U.S., there is bipartisan support for increasing defense budgets. Congress finalized the fiscal year 2022 defense appropriations in March and the administration has since issued the fiscal year 2023 defense budget request. Both of these base budgets show solid 4% to 5% top line growth with additional potential in supplemental funding. Based on initial indications from Congress, the final fiscal year 2023 appropriations could be even higher than the initial request is Congress looks to address the evolving threat landscape, but also to offset inflationary pressures. Currently, the fiscal year 2023 budget request includes a 4% increase in the investment account. The main driver behind this increase is a 9% increase in R&D to fund development of critical capabilities, particularly in space and deterrence. Space continues to be one of the fastest growing defense budget areas with a 30% plus year-over-year increase. The request also fully funds modernization of the strategic deterrent, including initial production funding for B-21, as well as significant year-over-year increase in development funding for GBSD. And NASA budgets are also growing in support of a new era of space exploration. The FY2023 budget request includes an 8% increase over FY2022, including funding ongoing programs such as Artemis and new initiatives for Moon to Mars effort. And globally, there is an ongoing paradigm shift regarding national security and several allies have pledged to increase defense spending as a result. We stand ready to support them in achieving their national security objectives as well. With a budget environment as context, I’ll take a few minutes to step back and frame our business strategy. Our fundamental goal is to be the leading technology company enabling the U.S. and its allies to protect freedoms, deter conflict, and sustain our planet. Our business strategy, which we’ve been executing for several years is focused on four core areas. First is maintaining technology leadership and delivering innovative and affordable solutions with speed. Next is sustainably and profitably growing our business in our customer’s highest priority missions, while maintaining contracting discipline. Third is keeping a laser focus on performance and driving cost efficiency. And finally, we are focused on deploying our capital in value creating ways for our customers and investors. This strategy has created strong alignment with our customer priorities and strengthened our portfolio position. As we sit here today, we expect this will enable us to accelerate our revenue growth rate in 2023 from the low-single digits in our 2022 guidance. By 2024, we also expect that by growing our business and delivering strong operational performance, we will be able to drive our segment operating margin rate to approximately 12%. And we continue to expect to grow our transaction adjusted free cash flow at a double-digit CAGR through this period. From a capital deployment perspective, investing in our business to support this growth outlook remains our top priority. After making such investments, we are targeting the return of at least a 100% of our free cash flow to investors in 2022. Underlying these performance goals and expectations is our position in several priority growth areas for our customers. Our role in supporting deterrents across all domain is indirect alignment to the needs of today’s changing global national security environment. For nearly seven decades, the U.S. has successfully mitigated the risk of broader global conflict through strategic deterrents. Northrop Grumman is the prime contractor on two of this recurrent deterrents modernization program. For the B-21 program, the air force confirmed that the first aircraft has entered the ground test phase, pays being the way for first flight. And there are five additional test aircraft in various stages of assembly. This progress is partly enabled by our digital design capabilities and advanced manufacturing technologies, which reduced risk ahead of the aircraft first flight. And looking forward, we expect sales on the B-21 program to grow as the EMD phase continues and we progress into low rate initial production. This assumption underpins our expectations for aeronautics revenue to be flat next year and return to growth in 2024. For GBSD, we remain on schedule. The program is expected to continue to ramp over the next couple of years, as we execute on the $13 billion EMD contract, with nearly $1.9 billion in expected revenue in 2022. We still expect the program to enter production in the a 2026 timeframe with initial operating capability plan for 2029. GBSD production is expected to be a material growth driver in the middle of the decade, as it’s reflected in the President’s budget. In addition, our space business continues to experience rapid growth as our customers rearchitect their space-based capabilities. This growth is in response to adversaries developing more sophisticated weapons, the need for more capable missile defense warning systems, as well as the migration of some airborne missions to the space domain. In the first quarter, we’ve received several new awards that showcase the breadth of our space portfolio and our ability to compete and win in various domains, including ground systems and proliferated LEO constellations. These awards build on our significant backlog and positions our space business for expected double-digit growth once again this year. Notable wins in this quarter include a nearly $700 million award for 42 satellites in low earth orbit that provide high speed, low latency communications for the Space Development Agency’s transport layer. And we want a $340 million contract for deep space advance radar capability or DARC that dramatically improves situational awareness, particularly in geosynchronous orbits. And in Q2, we anticipate an approximately $2 billion award from ULA to provide GEM 63 motors for launch services, including in support of Amazon’s Project Kuiper. Another area, where we see meaningful future growth opportunities is in Mission Systems, particularly our Network Information Solutions business, which at its core is a communications and processing business. In this area, we have proven technology leadership in connecting and linking military systems with a broad portfolio of product, including networking systems and radios and cyber computing and AI capabilities. We’re seeing a rapid evolution in this area with ambitious goals from our customers to field open, distributed, secure networks that are more survivable. Initiatives like JADC2 are providing demand for our existing platform agnostic solutions, as well as providing opportunities for new technologies we are developing. And we are creating partnerships like the 5G partnership with AT&T that we announced this month to strengthen our competitive position. We believe this communications business will be the fastest growing area of MS over the next couple of years. Given all that I’ve just outlined, you can see that our portfolio is aligned to the evolving national security environment and priority areas for our customers. We continue to demonstrate our ability to deliver compelling solutions in this environment. Ultimately, executing on our strategy depends on having the right culture and people. This is one of the reasons we focus on remaining an industry leader in ESG. I encourage you to look at our annual sustainability report, which we published in March. It provides insights to our progressive governance structure, our culture, our commitment to ethics, diversity, equity and inclusion and environmental sustainability. As we shared in this year’s report, we are committing to net zero emissions in our operations by 2035. We also published our first TCFD report, which provides additional transparency around our approach to managing the climate related risks and opportunities across our business. So with that, I’m going to turn the call over to Dave to provide more detail on our results and guidance. And then we’ll move on to Q&A. Dave?
Dave Keffer: Thanks, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter was a strong start to the year. We generated more bookings than we’ve been expecting, including competitive wins on several new programs. Our robust backlog of $76 billion continues to be over two times our annual sales and provides the foundation for future growth. First quarter sales totaled $8.8 billion down 2% organically and up sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2021. Q1 sales represented about 24% of our full year guidance in line with our prior projection. We experienced some temporal COVID related productivity and volume impacts to start the year, which receded as the quarter progressed. Continued tightness in the broader labor market represents a challenge that we’re working hard to mitigate as we ramp on large contracts and address strong market demand for our capabilities. We continue to make progress on this front and are pleased with the trajectory that we’re on. Our execution remains solid in the quarter. We delivered a segment operating margin of 11.8% in line with the midpoint of our full year guidance. And we made progress on several elements of our long-term cost efficiency strategy. At the program level, net EAC results varied across sectors as is common in any given quarter. One of the positive EAC changes in Q1 was a $67 million favorable adjustment on the B-21 program related to performance incentives. In addition to what Kathy noted, I wanted to take this opportunity to provide a bit more color on this franchise program. B-21 is currently in its cost type EMD phase with a variety of incentive fees for which we accrue based on anticipated achievement. Our projections for certain EMD incentives improved in Q1 leading to the favorable EAC adjustment. We are in a critical integration and test portion of the EMD phase this year. And we continue to focus on production efficiencies. The low rate initial production or LRIP phase will begin over the next year and run in parallel with EMD for a period of time. LRIP for B-21 is fixed price. And we expect to recognize revenue for the LRIP lots separately from EMD. The LRIP units were priced as part of our original bid for the program. The full rate production phase or FRP has yet to be negotiated and includes the majority of the aircraft volume in the program of record. Based on our current projections, which run roughly through the end of this decade, we continue to expect production to be priced and profitably executed within the program’s average procurement unit cost target. Now turning back to our Q1 results. Diluted earnings per share in the quarter were $6.10 reflecting our strong segment performance. Keep in mind we had a headwind of roughly $0.46 resulting from lower CAS pension costs in our overhead rates that we booked in the first quarter of last year. In aggregate, our transaction adjusted earnings per share were down 7% compared to Q1 2021, primarily due to non operational factors such as lower net FAS/CAS pension and the performance of marketable securities. It’s worth noting that the after tax net FAS/CAS pension adjustment in Q1 was nearly $250 million representing $1.58 of earnings per share. This was $40 million lower than Q1 a year ago and a $0.19 EPS headwind. We expect similar impacts in each of the remaining quarters in 2022. That total net FAS/CAS pension adjustment primarily reflects the actuarial gains and losses in our pension plans and is not something we consider when assessing the company’s operating performance. Moving to 2022 guidance. We have minimal changes. We’re increasing the sales guidance for our space business due to continued strong momentum and recent capture of new awards as Kathy outlined. We now estimate sales in the mid to high $11 billion range, which would result in another year of double digit sales growth. At defense systems, we’re adjusting our estimate to the mid to high $5 billion range to reflect a lower first quarter, particularly on some of our international training programs. These two adjustments offset each other and our full year company level sales guidance is unchanged. With respect to our quarter sales profile, we expect Q2 sales to be between 24% and 25% of our full year guidance midpoint with our expectation near the middle of that range. From there, we expect accelerating year-over-year growth in the second half of the year. Next, I wanted to take a moment to talk about cash. First quarter transaction adjusted free cash flow was consistent with our expectations and in line with our historical seasonal trends. The decrease compared to the first quarter of 2021 reflects timing of collections and disbursements and our full year guidances unchanged. After the quarter ended, we made our first cash tax payment of the year, which included the projected effect of current R&D tax law. Our next estimated tax payment is due June 15. We continue to project that cash taxes would be about $1 billion higher for the full year should the current law remain in effect. But we remain optimistic that we will see it deferred or eliminated given the broad bipartisan support for doing so. Our base case assumption for cash flow and P&L continues to be that section 174 R&D tax law will be changed. If and when that happens, we would expect to file for any appropriate refunds of taxes paid and also recognize a spike in corporate unallocated cost in that quarter associated with the reversal of the deferred state tax asset that had been building year-to-date. I note that we’ve already incorporated these items in our full year EPS guidance. We remain committed to providing excellent shareholder returns with at least $1.5 billion in share repurchases targeted for this year on top of a healthy competitive dividend. As Kathy mentioned, in aggregate, we expect to return at least 100% of our 2022 transaction adjusted free cash flow to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases Over time, we expect the cash on our balance sheet at a typical year end to be roughly $2 billion, which would continue to provide flexibility and liquidity. Our capital deployment strategy also prioritizes investing in our business. We continue to expect capital expenditures for 2022 to be in line with 2021 levels. And later today, we will file an S-4 with the SEC as the final step of the obligor exchange process that we executed last summer on certain debt instruments. Overall, we’re pleased with our first quarter results and achievements as we continue to build a strong foundation to accelerate growth and deliver on our long-term value creation strategy. And with that, we’ll open your call up for questions.
Operator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Doug Harned: Good morning. Thank you. Kathy, you talked about aeronautics and how you’re looking at the top line 2022 to 2024. But this has been complicated. You’ve got several mature programs that are set to decline this year, even F-35 trajectory looks complicated, E-2D appears to be ending in 2024, and then beneath that you’ve got high growth on the B-21 ahead. You’ve got a budget boost for Triton. Can you help us understand that puts and takes here that get you to those revenue expectations for the next few years?
Kathy Warden: Sure, Doug, and you did a nice job of outlining the key moving parts in the aero portfolio. Let me start with the mature programs. These are the ones we’ve been talking about for several years, Global Hawk, Joint Stars that are in the air force plan for retirement, and that is happening in the near term. Then we have things like what you noted with E-2D, it will reach its program of record quantities over the next several years. We don’t see this as an issue in 2023 and 2024, but as we look to 2025 and beyond that program will be reliant on international sales. And I will say that we are building a quite a bit of international interest for E-2D and prosecuting on a pipeline there. But the Navy program of record will reach its full quantity. And then F-35, we look at that it fairly stable over the next couple of years is what we’ve been saying. And I know there’s question about the quantity and the budget request and how that impacts the Northrop Grumman quantities. It really doesn’t have a material impact because we already we’re planning to build toward our capacity and working with Lockheed Martin, it appears that that plan is still intact. And then as you know, there are some opportunities that layer additional sales into the plan over the next several years. B-21 being the most notable for the first time, the President’s budget shows the production lay in starting in 2023. And you can see that that grows significantly in that same timeframe. So lots of put and takes, but as we look forward to 2023, we see those netting out to about flat with where we expect to finish 2022, and then largely based on B-21 growth and not having any major headwinds in 2024 from the other programs I just outlined we see growth in 2024.
Doug Harned: Well, and just as a follow-up within that, the new budget, there’s a big boost for Triton. And if I look at unmanned systems, this has been an area where I mean, at least a while back the company had talked a lot about differentiation because of the operating architectures that had been developed at Northrop Grumman, but we saw – we’ve seen Global Hawk come down, hail systems, I think there’s a Triton boost is good. But how do you think of growth potential in unmanned systems overall from this point?
Kathy Warden: We still see both the Air Force and the Navy looking at unmanned systems as a key part of their architecture. But these won’t be either the highest quantity or the highest price assets in their fleet. So when you think about the overall materiality of unmanned systems in an aeronautics portfolio, whether it be ours or others, it’s not going to be one of the bigger drivers for growth over the next decade. But it’ll be important and the capabilities that we have, and that we have refined through our work on our hail platforms, as well as some smaller platforms, I think is highly relevant to our positioning for this market in the future.
Doug Harned: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Your line is open.
Robert Stallard: Thanks so much. Good morning.
Kathy Warden: Good morning, Rob.
Robert Stallard: Kathy, thanks for the additional detail on the B-21 there. But I was wondering if we could – I don’t if we dig in any further on this. You mentioned that the LRIP portion is fixed price, and would’ve been signed a few years ago. I was wondering how this now stands with regard to the inflation that the whole world is dealing with and how you’re going to manage that?
Kathy Warden: Yes. Thanks for the question, because this is an important thing for us to touch on it. Why we provided a bit more clarity on what production looks like on the B-21 program as we are approaching that phase. We did it’s a – that quantity. That quantity is not something I can share, but it’s a small portion of the overall program of record as part of the initial bid. And that is what constitutes LRIP. And that was bid is fixed price. And as we put that bid together, of course, we at the time laid in some expectations around growth inflation to adjust to this time period. And we will continue to look out whether those assumptions still hold. I’ll remind you we’re not really going to be into the production phase for a couple of years in any significant way. And so we still have a good bit of time and we expect inflation is going to modulate, and we’re not seen based on the assumptions we’ve made today, a material impact to the program. And part of why Dave shared how we think about the accounting on the program is so that we are already looking at those LRIP blocks [ph] since we are obligated under our initial proposal for those quantities, and still expect to be able to produce those within the government target price, which is published and is updated and adjusted for inflation on a regular basis. The last time the air force did that was in 2019, a little over 600 million APAC [ph]. And we continue to look at our own bids and makes sure that we see a path to executing those quantities profitably. And we reiterated that again today.
Robert Stallard: That’s very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Good morning, Kathy. Hey Todd. Thank you. Since we’re on the topic of profitability, Kathy you laid up some margin expansion targets through 2024. I think you mentioned 12% given the growth drivers you have, how are you also thinking about just mix again, you touched on inflation. It doesn’t seem a big deal and productivity overall?
Kathy Warden: So mix is becoming less of a factor for us in the next few years. We had talked about our mix being roughly 50% cost type and 50% fixed plus price that’s exactly where we are as we sit here in the first quarter, and we don’t see that varying too much over the next couple of years, maybe a percentage point higher on cost plus or two, as we look at the next couple of years. When we see that inflection point to more fixed price is as both B-21 and GBSD start to move into their production phases. And so you can think of that notionally around the 2025, 2026 timeframe, the middle part of the decade. And even then we don’t see a very large swing in our mix because we still have development work that will be bidding and continuing to execute in the pipeline. So mix is less of a factor as we look forward at the company level. Now, I will note that when you get into the segment level, for instance, in space, those drivers are more pronounced. And so we do see a bit more of a mixed shift there. And you asked about how we think of that in terms of profitability. So mix no longer being a big driver when we think about profitability and cost efficiency and performance being the two big drivers that we are focused on. So I talked about that in our strategy in terms of cost efficiencies, we’ve put in place a dedicated team at the company level, and we’re working all elements of cost to ensure that we’re operating as sufficiently as possible.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next one we have the line of Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead.
Peter Arment: Yes. Good morning, Kathy and Dave. Hey, Dave, maybe I could just follow-up on kind of the Kathy’s comments on the outlook, kind of through 2024. You mentioned double digit growth and free cash flow. How do we think about it from kind of the puts and takes on it, just an overall conversion rate, below a 100% currently and just what’s the right way to think about it as we look out through 2024?
Dave Keffer: Sure. Thanks for the question, Peter. No significant changes to our free cash outlook from when we described it in some detail a quarter ago. It’s not a three-year outlook that we intend to modify on a quarterly basis unless there are material changes. And so the same drivers exist today. We do see an opportunity over the next few years for us to continue investing appropriately in the business, but to have CapEx come down slightly, especially in 2024 in comparison to 2022 and 2023. So that’s one of the drivers of free cash flow acceleration. We also have the end of the payroll tax deferral issue that benefited us in 2020 and as an outflow in the next in the following two years. And so that will benefit 2023 and 2024. On the kind of working capital side, as we’ve noted 2019, 2020, we’re very strong years of working capital efficiency. At this point, we’d put our working capital metrics up against any in the industry. We very proud of the efficiency of our balance sheet and the next year that we see opportunities for continued enhancement there is largely 2024 due to the timing of some payment expectations in that year, incentive milestones and such. So again, no changes to the outlook there. Those are some of the key moving pieces, relatively stable on the working capital front in 2022 and 2023 before seeing those opportunities in 2024. And as we’ve noted we do see expansion in the core business, both at the top line and the bottom line supporting that outlook over the next few years as well.
Peter Arment: That’s great caller. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Ron Epstein: Yes. Hey. Good morning. Kathy, what have you seen in international markets? I mean, since the events in the Ukraine started to play out we’ve heard from several NATO members that they’re going to up their defense spending to 2% as a floor potentially, right? I mean, Germany kind of doubled their defense budget over a weekend. So what have you seen on the international front and customer interest there, and then I have a follow on after that.
Kathy Warden: Sure. Ron, well, we’ve definitely seen interests pick up across Europe and we’ve been engaging with customers there to understand their needs and timelines. Of course, we haven’t seen a dramatic shift in immediate spending plans, part of what I know each of the countries is thinking their way through is what the need is and then what their requests will be and what their reliant on U.S. product will be. So we expect that to be more of a 2023, 2024 timeframe to get clarity and start to see real award opportunities. In the meantime, we are providing a good deal of support to Ukraine, just in the sense of our assets being used either by the U.S. or our NATO partners to provide surveillance intelligence and monitoring of the situation and as well, providing some additional capabilities into Poland.
Ron Epstein: Got it. Got it. And then kind of the follow on there, more domestically focused. Do you expect the nuclear posture review, I guess isn’t out yet, and some changes in that and what that could mean for GBSD and some of the other programs you’re on in the wake of what’s gone on in Eastern Europe?
Kathy Warden: Well, even though the nuclear posture review hasn’t been fully released, there has been executive summary provided and the President has supported all three legs of the triad in the nuclear posture review. As I was spending time on the hill just this week, I still see very strong bipartisan and support for all three legs of the triad. And to your point, I think that support has even grown in the last two months as a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and a recognition of the importance of the triad to contain that conflict. So we see that continuing to be a tailwind to the modernization programs that are underway.
Ron Epstein: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. The next one we have the line of Mr. David Strauss with Barclays. Please go ahead.
David Strauss: Thanks. Good morning.
Kathy Warden: Good morning.
David Strauss: Kathy, you talked about the upside in the fiscal 2022 enacted budget, the proposed 2023 budgets. Is there any way you can quantify what that might mean to your revenue growth trajectory in 2023 and 2024? I know it takes time to come through, but I guess relative to whatever you were thinking maybe 6 months to 12 months ago, I mean does this add a 100 basis points, 200 basis points, any sort of quantification you can give?
Kathy Warden: Yes, David, as I mentioned in my remarks, we do expect our revenue growth to accelerate into 2023. Right now we see that in line with 2023 consensus. It’s really early even in this year, but we expect 2022 to be in low-single growth outlined in our guide and with the growth rate accelerating in the second half. So we do expect that momentum that we see in the second half of this year to carry into 2023. And of course, the 2023 President’s budget is a good indication that demand for our products is holding up extremely well. The one thing I would note is we’re really mindful of the supply site challenges that continue. Certainly, we saw those most notably at the beginning of this year and they have in our case really moderated as we looked at March and April performance, but we’re keeping up close eye on everything from the tight labor market to inflation and COVID-related headwinds that could slowdown our growth rate even though we have strong budget support for our programs. So and sum all that up by saying there’s reason for optimism and we have optimism, but it’s cautious optimism. And it’s a bit early in the year for me to try to put a number on our 2023 growth rate given all of those puts and takes, but we’ll certainly keep you updated on each quarterly call on our outlook for next year.
David Strauss: Okay. That’s helpful color. And as a follow-up, you offered a little bit more detail on B-21. So I thought I would ask this, it looks like in the budget, there’s about a $2 billion funding increase in fiscal 2023 versus the rate that the levels that we’ve seen over the last several years. I mean is that the kind of revenue growth kind of increase we’re looking at B-21 looking out over the course of the next couple of years.
Kathy Warden: Well, the government is looking at layering production on top of EMV. And so what you can see in the fight is pretty stark jump in 2023 is production gets layered in, but of course, keep in mind all of those dollars won’t be spent in calendar year 2023. And then there’s not as pronounced to step up after that. But production funding still remains healthy as EMV starts to come down. And that’s the profile we would typically see on a program like this, but it does project robust funding for B-21 through the decade. And we – that is what we are anticipating as well.
David Strauss: All right. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. The next one we have the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Seth Seifman: Thanks very much, and good morning. Just starting off with a quick clarification earlier about the move to the 12% segment margin. When you talked about the mix change in space, Kathy was that – I assume, was that getting more towards cost plus as you – when you work and GBSD grows and if so, is that a headwind? And if that’s the case, what are the segments where you expect to see margin expansion?
Kathy Warden: Yes. So I should have been more clear extra pointing that out. We do expect more costless work in space over the next couple of years, as GBSD continues to grow. We’re also executing on next generation interceptor, which is a big growth driver and then some assorted classified efforts that are in the development phase in continuing to scale as well. In terms of other businesses that are moving in the opposite direction, so stronger margin rates, aeronautics is one that we see having stronger margin rates. You’ll – you already see that in our guide for this year being higher than last. And we anticipate that we’ll continue to see strong and healthy margin rates there. Defense and mission systems already perform at very strong margin rates. So we expect that to continue, but the real offset that we see is space and aero. And I will also say that in space, we’ve seen the bulk of that pressure already because keep in mind while GBSD will continue to grow in the EMV phase, not to the extent that we’ve seen it went from a couple hundred million a year to over $2 billion. And so over this time period, and the majority of that will already have happened through the 2022 period.
Seth Seifman: Great. thank you. And then just a quick follow-up on rocket motors and [indiscernible] First of all, it seems like there’s some friction in the supply chain for rocket motors based on some comments this past week, I assume that’s not Northrop Grumman, but do you see any opportunity to take share as a result? And secondly, is there any supply chain or other friction for the Northrop space business as a result to disruption in the space supply chain from the war in Ukraine?
Kathy Warden: Yes. So there’s a lot to unpack there. Let me start with commentary around rocket motor providers. We are performing well across the Board for our primes, and we do not believe that any comments that were made relate to Northrop Grumman performance. We continue to offer our capability to any who would like to have our rocket motors, and we’re going to continue to do that. And we’re investing in that business to make sure that we are a good and stable performer and provider. In terms of our exposure to Ukraine and Russian rocket motors, we do have some exposure on our CRS contract. So this is where your Antares launch vehicle, we procure rocket motors from Russia, and of course from Ukraine. We have what we need for the next two launches. And so there isn’t the immediate disruption and we have a plan in place that we could use other sources if needed beyond those two launches. But of course, it’s our preference to keep the relationships intact between Russia and the U.S. around the space station. And that’s what these rocket motors are used for to take cargo to the international space station. But we are working closely with NASA to make sure we’re following the U.S. government lead in that case.
Seth Seifman: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. The next one we have the line of Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley.
Kristine Liwag: Thanks. Good morning, guys. And Kathy taking a 30,000 foot view, I mean the outlook for the fed in the U.S. and our allies is positive. You’re on two legs with a nuclear triad, and there’s clear bipartisan support for these program. Free cash flow is stable. I mean when you take a step back, the company’s future is pretty visible here. And with the FTC blocking the Lockheed-Aerojet rocket dying deal, large M&A seems to be off the table for now. The company, so Northrop had bought back about half its shares outstanding in the past 15 years, if the priority is still buybacks at some point in the distant future, there may not be any more stock to buy. How do you think about long-term uses of cash especially as free cash flow remains positive, and you’ve got so much visibility?
Kathy Warden: Well, it’s an excellent strategic question, Kristine, and one that we spend a good time deal of time thinking about. And I will say our first priority is investing in the business and you have seen us invested in elevated level both CapEx as well as there are R&D is the percentage of sales over the last several years, and we are not backing away from that core part of our strategy. I noted when I laid out our strategic plan, that technology leadership and innovation is core to how we have attained the position that we’re in and in my view will be the most important factor to retaining that position of strength. And so we will continue to invest in our business, but with that said, strong cash flows. And as you noted as strong outlook for growth to fuel those cash flows gives a us a lot of optionality in our capital deployment strategy. We do believe that at some point M&A may come back on the table, but for the immediate term, as you said, large needle moving M&A is likely not to be strategy that we can execute. And so we are looking at returning capital to our shareholders at this important time through a competitive dividend and share buyback. We do tend to prefer share repurchase in this environment just to give us a little more flexibility as environmental factors change, but share repurchase, it’s still a core part of our strategy, but it’s by no means the only method that we believe we create value for shareholders, and we stay focused on investing in our company.
Kristine Liwag: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. The next one we have the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. Please go ahead.
Cai von Rumohr: Yes, thanks so much. So I recall on the Q4 call that you talked about book-to-bill being I believe one or a little below one this year, you started out strong particularly in space. Could you tell us how has that changed? Can you – is any thought you could be above one and how should we think about all the areas because space looks like it’s on its way to being well above one?
Kathy Warden: Yes. Cai, we do not expect book-to-bill to be over one this year. It is off to a stronger start than we expected. And so I will be clear. It is likely to be higher than we anticipated coming into the year, but still don’t see it crossing the 1.0 threshold and space is a key driver as you noted of that strength, but we see broad strength in booking this year beyond what we had expected, some nice competitive wins in our Defense Systems business and our aero business also having strong awards, particularly as we look to book lot 15 aggregate demand on F-35 this year. What we look at, and I’ve mentioned this on prior calls is a multi-year book-to-bill. And so having a portfolio where we’ve brought in some very sizeable long-term awards like B-21 and GBSD, we have a backward looking book-to-bill over 1.2 aggregate for the last three years. And so we don’t expect to have that kind of performance in book-to-bill every year, but we still expect our four-year average once we take 22 into consideration to be well over 1.1. So sustaining the backlog growth that we need to fuel the business growth we anticipate.
Cai von Rumohr: Very good. And sort of as a follow-up, we have a strong FY2022 appropriation, we have a big 2023 request, which everyone expects to be plused up by Congress. Any color as you think about going forward. Is that book-to-bill likely to be – is your best guess that it goes up over the next couple of years. Any color you could provide would be great.
Kathy Warden: I would just say that we see an environment, where we can keep that multi-year average well above one.
Cai von Rumohr: Terrific. Thank you very much.
Kathy Warden: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next one we have the line of Myles Walton with UBS. Please go ahead.
Myles Walton: Thanks. Good morning. First one, just a clarification, maybe for Dave. The 100% free cash flow return to investors in 2022, is that before the amortization tax impact or how does that work?
Dave Keffer: Thanks for the clarification, Myles. That is independent of the Section 174 determination. So we intend to return at least 100% of free cash flow in either case, whether it is deferred or not.
Myles Walton: So if it is deferred, would you return the guided number that is not adjusted for the tax? So that is $2.5 billion to $2.8 billion or would you just be signing it to 100%.
Dave Keffer: That’s correct. So we have roughly $1 billion run rate on the dividend side, we’ve committed to $1.5 billion of share repurchase. And so you can take from that, there would be incremental potential if Section 174 were deferred.
Myles Walton: Okay, thanks. And then Kathy, is it within – in terms of supply chain issues, everybody sees something, are you seeing it within defense systems as relates to some of the munitions? Is that sort of where you might be seeing it? Or it doesn’t look like you’re being terribly affected or you’re forecasting it better than most. So maybe just give some color there.
Kathy Warden: So Myles, I wouldn’t point to any one part of our business, where we are seeing dramatic impacts. Aero, where we have high volume line in F-35 we saw last year and we talked about that quite clearly. As we got into the first quarter of this year and the plan that we laid in place, we are meeting that plan on F-35, but there was impact. And we still are working to address that impact on the F-35. Other than that, there’s really no single program or area of the business that I point to just a little bit of sluggish attendance coming into this year, due to COVID cases, some light impact on electronic supply, both to Mission Systems and Defense Systems, but nothing material enough to really call out individually.
Myles Walton: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next one, we have the line for Robert Spingarn with Melius Research.
Robert Spingarn: Good morning. You’ve given us really great incremental detail on B-21, but I just wanted to perhaps flesh this out a little bit further, if you can, and talk about the revenue cadence with EMD. When EMD and LRIP overlap, are we going to have a peak revenue year or does the LRIP grow enough and the EMD small enough that its – we should see growth through the rest of the decade?
Kathy Warden: Well, I would point you to the [indiscernible] So the budget does not show a peak revenue year through fiscal year 2027. So I can’t provide you much more than that, because quantities and the like are classified. But if you just look at what was in the – what the administration submitted now, of course, this has to go through appropriations and it’s always subject to annual revision as well. But what was submitted this year for the five year outlook does not show a peak year through 2027. Does that help?
Robert Spingarn: Okay. And then – and just based on what you talked about with profitability and relative to EMD margins. Would it be fair to assume that the profit cadence is not the same as the revenue cadence? In other words, the margin mix, the margins would drop at some point because of the switch in contract. And then just Kathy, as a follow-up to that, do you think possibly going forward, we’ll see less fixed price development on new contracts. Just not so much focused on B-21, but what we’re seeing elsewhere in the industry – across the industry on all the charges on a lot of these programs.
Kathy Warden: Well, I can’t really comment on B-21 mix of EMD and production rate. And so let me go straight to your broader strategic question, which is an important one on whether the government will likely shift away from fixed price development. I do believe that there will be a shift away. And I think we’ve already seen that to a large degree. And frankly, B-21, well, we were asked to bid fixed price LRIP. We did not have a fixed price development phase of that program. And there’s a very important distinction in my mind between production, even early stages of production at fixed price and the development phase being at fixed price. And of course, GBSD is a cost plus development program. So that’s why I suggest that we are already seeing a shift on major weapons systems developments to a costless development phase, which in my mind has always been the right approach for the government to contract for development. By definition, there is inherent technology development and risk associated with that phase. And you want to be able to apply resources to reduce that risk into production. And if the government doesn’t have that latitude, because they’re set at fixed price, then the contractor has to do that often out of their own profit, which is really tough decisions to make. And I think it impacts the ability then for the program to be successful over the full life cycle. And of course, the majority of the government’s costs are in the production and sustainment phases of the life cycle, not development. But I think the government recognizes this, and it’s why we’ve seen a shift away from fixed price development on these large weapons systems. Now, there still will be some fixed price development in the system, but I don’t see it being a material driver.
Robert Spingarn: Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.
George Shapiro: Yes. Good morning. Dave, I wanted to ask unbilled receivables we’re up like $600 million in the quarter. Does that reflect the F-35 work that you’ve done, but you can’t show as revenues yet until the Lot 15 to 17 contract is signed? And if so then that $600 million first quarter revenues and will help sometime later in the year. So if you just comment on that.
Dave Keffer: Thanks for the question, George. No, is the short answer. The unbilled receivable growth is not directly related to F-35 or any one other program in the portfolio. Rather, I would point you to the common seasonality that we tend to see in the first quarter, given the timing of receipts in that case. And we’re broadly speaking about free cash flow, seasonality, the timing of payments as well. We tend to have an outflow in the first quarter of the year, and this year is almost exactly in line with the average of the last four or five years. So no significant single items there. On F-35, the P&L, sales and other lines were not affected by the timing of contract negotiations to your point nor would they be anticipated to be in a meaningful way through the end of this year.
George Shapiro: Because I noticed, I mean, the unbilled receivables were up like about double what they were in last year’s first quarter. That’s part of the reason for the question.
Dave Keffer: I appreciate the question. Last year’s first quarter was actually the anomaly there, where we had a stronger free cash flow result and working capital change in the first quarter of the year than we had had in any of the prior five or six. And so this year is more in line with history. So it’s a very good point, last year was the unusual one.
George Shapiro: Okay. And then just one for you, Kathy, I mean, defense looks like it’s going to be the weaker business going forward. It’s one of your smaller businesses. You considered divestiture of any pieces of that business.
Kathy Warden: Well, George, as you know, we did look at the entirety of our portfolio and divested the IT services business that was in defense. And we were very intentional and thoughtful about that, but we looked at the rest of the portfolio and feel that it has nice energy with our business. And we do see opportunity to grow that business. Just a little bit of reset here that the business is experiencing. But the weapons portfolio continues to grow and we have nice synergy between the aircraft sustainment and modernization and our aeronautics business. And our IBCS portfolio sits in there, and we absolutely is that program now is maturing and we’ve won full rate production, sea growth there. So we’re happy with the portfolio, a little bit of transition to growth that we’re still working our way through here. But no, nothing else that I would look to the best in that portfolio right now.
George Shapiro: Okay. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. The next one we have the line of Richard Safran with Seaport Research. Please go ahead.
Richard Safran: Kathy, Dave, Todd, good morning. A lot’s been asked already. And so I have a general question regarding one of Dave’s opening remarks. With respect to major platforms and systems, you’ve rapidly gained a lot of share, a number of programs in development you’ve been talking about it all morning. Now, historically, one problem that comes along with that is having to use the A team then the B team, et cetera. And all the while maintaining execution, which, by the way, just judging from the incentive fee on the B-21 is actually pretty darn good. Now there are still opportunities out there. So my question is, is Northrop’s plates full. Dave, you mentioned labor, do both of you feel you have sufficient resources to support, bringing on additional programs and still maintain the current level of execution. Thanks.
Dave Keffer: Thanks for the questions. Certainly, those are topics and priorities that are front of mind for us these days. You heard both Kathy and I comment in the opening remarks about the criticality of execution and labor, our people, our resources, the hearts and minds of this company are at the center of our execution capability. To your point, we’ve demonstrated ourselves well over the last few years of execution efficiency of maintaining costs and schedule on many key programs. And we devote a lot of resources to that. I wouldn’t say that we’re at a point where we’re at capacity where we couldn’t take on additional work. We’re certainly devoting all potential resources to bringing additional capacity on board and have ramped significantly over the last few years, both in headcount and key supplier relationships. So that’s certainly a priority for us. Certainly, we’re spending a lot of time in that area today. But we’re eager to continue to meet the key demands of our customers and feel that we’re well aligned with those areas of demand in the budget outlook, as we’ve described on the call.
Richard Safran: Okay.
Kathy Warden: And that’s probably a place to leave it. I think we are blessed to have a lot of A teams. So thanks everybody for calling in today and listening to our call. As always, we wish you well, and look forward to talking to you again in July. Take care.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2021 Q4  (2022-01-27 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's Fourth Quarter Year-End 2021 Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. My name is Natalia, and I will be your operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Todd Ernst, Treasurer and Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Ernst, please proceed.
Todd Ernst: Thank you, Natalia, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's fourth quarter 2021 conference call. We'll refer this morning to a PowerPoint presentation that is posted on our IR web page. But before we start, I'd just like to go through a couple of comments here. The matters discussed on today's call, including 2022 guidance and beyond, including our outlooks reflect the company's judgment based on information available at the time of this call. They constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to safe harbor provisions of federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which are noted in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties may cause actual company results to differ materially. Today's call will include non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to our GAAP results in our earnings release. And on today's call are Kathy Warden, our Chairman, CEO and President; and Dave Keffer, our CFO. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kathy. Kathy?
Kathy Warden: Thank you, Todd. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We delivered another year of solid operating performance in 2021 and positioned our business for continued growth in 2022. We are executing our strategy, which is to grow the business today and into the future, maintain excellent performance and reduce costs to deliver strong margin rates and deploy our capital to create value. We made significant progress in executing this strategy again in 2021. Our organic sales growth for the year was 3%. Our segment operating margin was an exceptionally strong, 11.8%, which increased 40 basis points compared to 2020 with performance more than offsetting mixed and COVID-related headwinds. We grew our transaction adjusted EPS by 8% and generated a $3.1 billion of transaction adjusted free cash flow. Regarding capital deployment, we returned a record $4.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, including a $500 million accelerated share repurchase that we announced in November of 2021. We strengthened our balance sheet, retiring over $2.2 billion of debt during the year and achieving an increased credit rating in the process. And we continue to invest in our business with over $1.4 billion in capital expenditures to create new technologies and support franchise programs. We also continue to add to our portfolio of franchise programs. With competitive wins on programs like the Integrated Battle Command System or IBCS as well as hypersonic and ballistic tracking space sensor and next-generation interceptor. As we look forward to '22 and beyond, we expect our organic growth will continue as we win new business and convert the robust backlog we've built over the past several years into sales growth. And while we'll know more about the President's budget request in the coming weeks, we continue to believe that our portfolio is strongly aligned with the threat environment and the key investment priorities of our customers. Further, we expect strong margin performance as well as double-digit free cash flow growth from 2022 through 2024. 2022 guidance reflects our confidence in our strategy, our broad portfolio and our ability to deliver continued growth and strong performance. As reported, the COVID pandemic continued to present challenges to labor availability, parts supply and shipping delays across the economy, particularly in the second half of last year. We have felt these effects and the challenges at both our supply chain and our own labor availability. We will continue to take proactive steps to address such covered risks, both to our employees and our business. And looking forward, our current guidance reflect the factors we know today and our best estimate for the remainder of the year. Dave is going to provide more details on the quarter, the full year and our guidance in just a few minutes. Turning now to the budget environment. The federal government continues to operate under a continuing resolution that currently run through February 18. Negotiations on the fiscal year 2022 appropriation bills are continuing. And we remain optimistic that Congress will reach an agreement by the end of the first quarter. The National Defense Authorization Act contained a $25 billion increase to the defense budget that represents 5% growth compared to fiscal year 2021, which we expect to also be supported in the appropriation bill. In the NDAA, there is continued support for our mutual programs, and several of our programs received incremental funding above the President's budget request, including Triton, E-2D F-35, F-18 and GATR, among others. And finally, we expect the FY '23 president budget to be delivered to Congress in March of this year, reflecting this administration's priorities in areas such as Mission Systems, space, missile defense, advanced weapons and deterrent. Focusing now on highlights in the quarter, one of our proudest moments with the launch of the web-based telescope on December 25. Northrop Grumman is the prime contractor for NASA on web, and we're honored to have partnered with NASA to provide the world with this revolutionary technology. West will appear more than 13.5 billion years into the past when the first Stars and Galaxy's were formed, ushering in an exciting new era of space observation and expanding our understanding of the universe. In addition to web, we're also supporting NASA's Artemis mission by producing the largest solid rocket motors ever built for the space launch vehicle system, which is being developed to send the first woman and next man to the moon. In the fourth quarter, the space sector received a $3.2 billion award to support Artemis missions 4 through 8. Another important milestone in the quarter was the competitively awarded IBCS in our Defense Systems sector. This program is a centrepiece of the U.S. Army's modernization strategy for air and missile defense and all-domain command and control. It's a prime example of our capabilities to integrate assets in the battle space regardless of source, service or domain. This is one of many examples of how we are helping our customers share data between systems and improve command and control in support of their JADC2 vision. In the area of missile defense, we had several milestones in the quarter, which position us to help our customers track and defend against hypersonic and ballistic missile threats. In the fourth quarter, we announced that HBTSS had passed its critical design review. These satellites are planned to be part of a multilayered network of spacecraft that will detect and track hypersonic missiles. Also in the quarter, we were selected by the Missile Defense Agency to design a glide phase interceptor for regional hypersonic missile defense. In our Mission Systems sector, we continue to see our customers prioritizing development of capabilities that will increase the effectiveness and survivability of legacy systems, as well as new technologies for next-generation systems. In the fourth quarter, MS received an accelerated award for F-16 SABR’s for approximately $200 million, and full year awards of approximately $700 million. We have now received total contract awards for near 1,000 radars for this program in support of the U.S. Air Force and National Guard as well as several international customers. In addition, our Network Information Systems business area within Mission Systems received approximately $1 billion in award for advanced processing solutions. This portfolio delivers strategic microelectronics focused on high-performance computing and security, which helps our customers with connectivity and processing solutions. We anticipate additional awards in this segment of the portfolio for the next few years, and we expect it will be a significant growth driver for MS in 2022. Finally, in aeronautics. The military aircraft market is undergoing a transition as our customers focus their investment in next-generation programs while divesting some legacy platforms. As we discussed certain programs in our portfolio at Aeronautics systems are maturing and experiencing headwinds. But there are also a number of exciting new opportunities that are emerging. This includes next-generation manned aircraft as well as new unmanned opportunities, which U.S. Air Force Secretary Kendall recently announced. In addition to pursuing these longer-term opportunities, we remain focused on executing our programs and delivering for our customers. Another important aspect of our company's future is our strategy for sustainability. We strongly believe that our environmental, social and governance programs play an important role in sustainable, profitable growth and in long-term value creation for our shareholders, customers and employees. Northrop Grumman is a leader in conservation activity with a 44% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions since 2010. In the fourth quarter, S&P released its global corporate sustainability assessment scores, and we ranked in the 96 percentile. We were included on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index North America for the sixth consecutive year, and we were included in the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the first time. Our ESG strategy also includes portfolio management actions. As we've discussed on earnings calls last year, we committed to transition out of the small aging and surveillance contract that we have for cluster munitions, and that contract is complete. And while we continue to be an ammunition supplier as both a prime and a merchant supplier, we have made the decision to transition our prime role in depleted uranium inhibition to another provider, following one final single production year contract. We are currently working to establish our next set of sustainability goals and priorities, specifically as they relate to greenhouse gas emissions, water conservation and solid waste diversion with a stronger emphasis on renewable energy. Overall, we're making substantial progress in our ESG journey, and we look forward to sharing more in our upcoming sustainability and TCFD report. So with that, I'll turn it over to Dave to provide more detail on our sector results and guidance. And then I have a few additional comments before we move on to Q&A.
David Keffer: Okay. Thanks, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. 2021 was another strong year of performance for the company. Before going through the details of our results and guidance, I'd like to note a few items to keep in mind when comparing Q4 to the same period last year. As we previewed in prior quarters, the divested IT services business, the equipment sale at AS and 4 more working days in Q4 2020 represented over $1.6 billion of sales when compared to Q4 2021. With that said, sales per working day in 2021 were at their highest level in Q4. Moving to sector results. We continue to see certain COVID-related effects on our labor and supply chain in Q4, and these effects were most significant in our aeronautics sector. The Q4 decline in AS sales was partially driven by fewer working days and the 2020 equipment sale, and it also included a $93 million unfavorable EAC adjustment on F-35. Turning to Defense Systems. Sales declined in Q4 and 2021, primarily due to the IT services divestiture. Organic sales were down 9% in Q4 and 4% for the full year, driven by the completion of our contract at the Lake City ammunition plant, which generated almost $400 million of sales in 2020. Mission Systems organic sales were down 3% in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the reduction in working days and up 6% for the full year. Higher 2021 sales were driven by increased volume on GATR, GBSD, SABR, J.Crew and restricted programs, among others. And lastly, Space Systems Q4 and full year organic sales rose by 6% and 24%, respectively. We continued to ramp significantly on franchise programs, including a $1.1 billion increase on GBSD in 2021. Growth was also driven by restricted space programs as well as NGI and Artemis. Moving to segment operating income and margin rate. AS operating margin rate decreased to 8.4% in the quarter and 9.7% for the full year due to the unfavorable EAC adjustment on F-35. In our other 3 sectors, segment operating margin rates met or exceeded the high end of our prior 2021 guidance ranges. Defense Systems operating margin rate increased 90 basis points to 12.1% in the quarter and 80 basis points to 12% for the full year. Higher operating margin rate was largely due to improved performance as well as recent contract completions. At Mission Systems, operating income and rate grew in both periods. As a result of higher EAC adjustments and business mix changes, operating margin rate grew to 15.9% in the fourth quarter and 15.6% for the full year. And at Space Systems, operating margin rate was 9.6% in the quarter and 10.6% for the full year. Favorable EAC adjustments from strong performance on commercial space programs helped offset mix pressures for the year. And keep in mind that space, along with AS and MS, benefited from the pension-related overhead benefits that we recognized in the first quarter of 2021. At the total company level, segment operating margin rate in the fourth quarter was the same as Q4 2020. The even with the F-35 charge in 2021, and it increased 40 basis points for the full year to 11.8%. Turning to EPS. Our transaction adjusted EPS declined to 9% from Q4 2020 to Q4 2021, primarily due to lower sales volume from the factors I described earlier. For the full year EPS we exceeded the high end of the EPS guidance range we provided in October. Transaction adjusted EPS grew 8% in 2021 due to strong segment performance and lower corporate unallocated costs. Lower corporate unallocated was driven by 2 items we've discussed in prior quarters: the $60 million benefit from an insurance settlement related to the former Orbital ATK business; and lower state taxes. Regarding our pension plans, asset performance was strong again in 2021 at nearly 11%, the third year in a row of double-digit asset returns. Our FAS discount rate increased 30 basis points to 2.98%. These factors resulted in a mark-to-market benefit of roughly $2.4 billion in 2021. In addition, our net pension funding status has improved by over $3 billion. And on a PBO basis, is now over 93% funded. We continue to project minimal cash pension contributions over the next several years. Also summarized to our pension cost estimates for the years 2022 through 2024. CAS recoveries are projected to continue declining over the planning period. And while this causes an EPS headwind, particularly in 2022, it makes our rates more competitive and our products more affordable. Our CAS prepayment credit is approximately $1.7 billion as of January 1 of this year. Now turning to cash. We generated nearly $3.6 billion of operating cash flow and $3.1 billion of transaction-adjusted free cash flow in 2021, in line with our expectations. In the fourth quarter, we made our final federal and state tax payments associated with the IT services divestiture of almost $200 million. We also made our first payment of roughly $200 million of deferred payroll taxes from the Cares Act legislation. The remaining payment of the same amount will occur this December. Looking ahead to 2022, our sector guidance is shown on Slide 9. This outlook assumes that appropriation bills are passed by the end of Q1, and it assumes a relatively consistent level of impact from the effects of COVID that we experienced in 2021. At aeronautics, we expect sales in the mid- to high $10 billion range. As we noted last quarter, we're projecting headwinds in our hail portfolio as well as lower sales on JSTARS, F-18 and our restricted business. Sales on F-35 are expected to be slightly higher in 2021 due to the EAC adjustment we booked in Q4. We expect an AS margin rate of approximately 10%, which is up 30 basis points year-over-year. For Defense Systems, we expect sales to be in the high $5 billion range as this business returns to modest organic growth following the IT services divestiture and in the completion of our Lake City contract. Operating margin rate is expected to remain very strong in the high 11% range. Mission Systems sales are projected to be in the mid-$10 billion range, up from $10.1 billion of organic sales in 2021, reflecting continued strength in demand for our products. Operating margin rate is expected in the low 15% range. Space Systems is expected to remain our fastest-growing business and to become our largest segment in 2022. Sales are projected in the mid-$11 billion range, up from -- up about $1 billion from 2021 with a margin rate in the low 10% range. Turning to Slide 10. Our total revenue guidance is $36.2 billion to $36.6 billion, representing a range of 2% to 3% organic growth, consistent with the rate we estimated in October 2021. This growth is enabled by our strong backlog, which stands at over $76 billion, and covers more than 2 years of annual sales. The 2021 book-to-bill of 0.9 times was lower than our prior expectation due to the AS F-35 award shift to 2022. More importantly, our 3-year trailing average book-to-bill is approximately 1.22, and remains the foundation of our current and future growth. As COVID-related headwinds that we experienced late in 2021 continue into early 2022, we anticipate that first quarter 2022 sales will be less than 25% of the full year. We have increased the segment operating margin rate outlook that we provided in October, as we now expect a rate roughly consistent with 2021 in the range of 11.7% to 11.9%. This projection reflects our continued disciplined approach to cost management in our efforts to offset mix headwinds with strong program performance. Altogether, we expect transaction adjusted earnings per share to be between $24.50 and $25.10, based on approximately 155 million weighted shares outstanding. As shown on Slide 11, this includes roughly $2 of year-to-year EPS headwinds from lower net pension benefits driven by the reduction in CAS recoveries and higher corporate unallocated expense due to the onetime benefits in 2021. Earnings volume from sales growth strong operating margin performance and the lower share count will help to offset those nonoperational items. We project 2022 transaction-adjusted free cash flow of $2.5 billion to $2.8 billion, assuming the R&D tax amortization law is deferred or repealed. We continue to project about $1 billion of higher cash taxes should current tax law remain in effect. As I mentioned, our cash tax outlook includes the final payroll tax payment from the CARES Act of approximately $200 million. CapEx is expected to remain roughly consistent with 2021 on an absolute dollar basis and slightly lower as a percentage of sales. Slide 12 provides our longer-term outlook on cash. The midpoint of our 2022 transaction-adjusted free cash flow guidance is $2.65 billion, and includes roughly $375 million of lower CAS recoveries than 2021. From there, we expect a double-digit free cash flow CAGR through 2024, driven by operational performance, lower CapEx and the absence of the payroll tax headwind. Our base case again assumes deferral of the R&D tax for all periods. Speaking of taxes, we're projecting an effective tax rate of approximately 17% going forward, roughly consistent with 2021, excluding the divestiture or mark-to-market pension effects. Also, we anticipate the resolution of an appeals process for certain open years of legacy OATK tax filings in 2022. Audit and appeals processes are underway, but in earlier stages for certain Northrop tax years. We refer you to our 10-K for additional details on the key items, both timing related and permanent in nature to be resolved in those processes. In closing, we're proud of our 2021 performance and we're focused on continuing to execute well on our business and financial strategy in 2022. With that, I'll turn the call back over to you, Kathy.
Kathy Warden: Thanks, Dave. In summary, we have strong franchise programs that are well aligned to budget priorities. We are focused on capturing and investing in new growth opportunities while also executing to drive earnings and cash flow growth. We delivered a solid set of results in 2021, and we are well positioned to continue growing and performing in 2022 and beyond. Our top priority for cash deployment remains shareholder return, including a competitive dividend and share repurchases. With that in mind, our Board of Directors recently approved an increase in our share repurchase authorization of $2 billion. And based on our outlook today, we plan on returning at least $1.5 billion to shareholders via share repurchase in 2022. Before turning to your questions, I would like to thank the Northrop Grumman team for delivering solid operational results with dedication and for severance. We have extraordinary talent, and this includes our leadership team. As we announced in November, Blake Larson, is retiring after a 40-year career with Northrop Grumman and its heritage companies. Blake has helped to position our space business for incredible growth and as important, a focus on performance and quality. We are grateful for his contributions to our company and our country. And I'd also like to welcome Tom Wilson to my leadership team as he succeeds Blake. Tom brings strong experience in the space market. He was part of the Space team, and I'm confident in his ability to lead this business. So with that, we'll go ahead and open the call up for questions. Natalia, back to you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley.
Kristine Liwag: Kathy, can you elaborate more on the labor and supply chain issues experienced in the quarter at aeronautics? Are these the same issues flagged last year? How long do you expect these issues to persist?
Kathy Warden: There are similar issues to what we flagged in the third quarter of last year, and they are related largely to labor availability in our own workforce as well as what we're seeing in our suppliers. And when I talk about labor availability, that's really with the Delta variant in the late part of the third quarter, early part of the fourth quarter and then Omicron again in the late part of the fourth quarter and now early part of 2022. We see higher levels of absenteeism. We -- our employee safety is our first priority. We encourage people to be out of work if they're experiencing any symptoms, and we also isolate people who have been in close contact. And so as a result, absenteeism has been higher in these surges, and it has an impact, particularly in our high-rate, high-volume production lines where people are in closer proximity and where whole work cells might be impacted if we have 1 person sick or out. And so that's why you see it more pronounced in our aeronautic sector because that's where we have really only 1 high-rate, high-volume production program, the F-35. And we've talked specifically about the impact to that program. Across the rest of the business, it's not that we aren't experiencing the same conditions, but we're able to mitigate them better, and you see less of a pronounced impact in any 1 period. But certainly, we would have expected to see a stronger fourth quarter top line had we not experienced those 2 surges.
Kristine Liwag: And also, you outlined what sounds like a fairly comprehensive ESG strategy. When you look at your portfolio, are there other areas where you're reevaluating your exposure?
Kathy Warden: So we've taken a very comprehensive look, not only at our strategy, but our portfolio and assessed what that exposure is. I do want to be clear. We are a defense contractor. And so we are supporting global security missions, largely in areas of deterrents, but also inclusive of weapon systems. And we expect to continue in those businesses because we believe they actually promote global human rights proliferation, not the contrary. But with that said, we have evaluated some portions of our portfolio that I've talked about in the past like cluster munitions. And today, making the confirmation that we plan to exit depleted uranium ammo as parts of the portfolio that we no longer wanted to support directly.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.
Seth Seifman: I wonder if you could talk a little bit about where aeronautics goes from here and how much the headwinds that are coming in 2022, persist into the out years? And then at the risk of asking about a classified program, when we think further out towards the middle of the decade and beyond, if every place that you're a prime contractor gets up to kind of the expected full rates of production in very rough and qualitative terms. What that means in terms of the Aeronautics top line several years down the line?
Kathy Warden: Seth, so I'll start and then ask Dave to provide a little more color and specificity. I see our aeronautic sector as having headwinds this year that will dissipate going into 2023. So we don't expect the same levels of decline as we move into next year. And then that trend reversing in the 2024 time frame. And I won't point to any particular program, but it is at that point in time that we expect some of the headwinds that we've discussed to be largely behind us and the opportunities for growth in higher volume of production in aeronautics to start to kick in. And so that would have both an upward trajectory for top line, but we also see their margin rates progressively improving over that period as well. So that gives you the macro view. Dave, anything you'd like to add to that?
David Keffer: I think you covered it well, Kathy. I think our '22 outlook is consistent both in the mid-single-digit decline and the sources of that decline with what we talked about in recent calls. As you pointed out, we expect 23 to be more stable and have growth opportunities beyond that. The other thing I'd point out is we're very focused on managing the business well in the meantime, cost management, managing our capital expenditures. And so we're focused on execution on delivery every day in that business and looking to optimize that outlook.
Operator: Next question is from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Kathy, thanks for the aeronautics color. I was wondering if maybe we could transition to the space, and if you could bridge us on the growth for space, it seemed like GBSD was maybe more additive in '21 than prior expectations. So how do we think about that growth cadence? And how do we think about the balance of growth across the other space portfolio?
Kathy Warden: So GBSD has been a significant component of space business growth in the last 2 years, and we expect that to start to level out. But GBSD continues to be a growth element in space for the foreseeable. But with that said, you're right to point out that there was significant growth in the rest of the base portfolio as well. Balancing about 50-50 with GBSD and contributing last year, and we expect that same trend to continue this year with the $1 billion or so of sales growth that we're projecting in space. And that really is broad-based growth. It's coming from all areas of the business, the propulsion, satellites as well as components. It's coming from both restricted and classified work as well as unclassified work and it's coming from a variety of customers, the new pace for COS Air Force as well as NASA as I highlighted today. So we really are seeing space growth be quite balanced, even in 2023 or 2022, but even more so as we look forward to 2023. And we expect it to continue to be one of, if not the fastest-growing sector for the foreseeable future.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America.
Ron Epstein: Yes. I was wondering if you could speak to -- you've seen some of the -- your HALE portfolio assets, maybe some of the legacy stuff start to fade away. Are there opportunities to replace that? What's out there in that world? Because it's hard to believe that, that asset class is just going to go away. So if you could speak to, are there opportunities for Northrop Grumman to replace those assets in the future?
Kathy Warden: Yes, Ron, and thanks for that question because we've talked a good bit about the headwinds in our HALE portfolio. And that's coming off of production of Global Hawk, which was not only for the U.S. Air Force, with several international customers; and then Triton, which is still early in its production. And those headwinds were the plateauing more of Triton and the production pause and then the Global Hawk phasing out. But the reality is autonomous systems are still an important part of both the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy strategies going forward as well as an important asset in the portfolio for our international customers. So we see that market is continuing to evolve. With some specificity to your question, I mentioned earlier in this call that the U.S. Air Force Secretary Kendall has recently been more specific about launching some new efforts in unmanned systems within the Air Force, and we do see those as opportunities that we will pursue. So there's starting to be some more meat on the bones as to what those specific opportunities will be. We do see the market as continuing to be attractive.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein.
Doug Harned: You gave guidance today for cash, free cash flow in 2022, 2023, 2024. And I guess, cash -- I mean, I understand you can project some things around pension, but cash is really the most volatile quantity here. And can you give us a sense of what type of sales and earnings profile actually drives those numbers in '23 and '24?
David Keffer: Doug, it's Dave. I'm happy to dig into that. I appreciate the question. I think you'll find today's outlook is consistent again with what we had projected at a higher level on our October call. I think it's important to provide some context when we talk about our free cash flow outlook over these next few years. Our CAS pension reimbursements were over $800 million just 2 years ago in 2020, and we were projecting them to reach $1 billion by this point in 2020. After new legislation and a couple of years of fantastic asset returns, that CAS reimbursement is now really just a de minimis benefit to us along with much improved funded status on the pension side. And that's the primary driver of the change over the last couple of years. But what that does for us is create a great foundation for us in '22 to build off of and grow more rapidly over the next few years. And that supports that 10-plus percent CAGR we've been talking about. So '21 free cash flow was around $3.1 billion. And as we talked about, CAS reimbursement is down almost $400 million in '22 from '21. The working capital assumption over the next year is roughly unchanged, similar in '23 before creating more opportunity in '24 and beyond. We talked a bit about the payroll tax deferral that ends with a payment in late '22. So that, too, creates a tailwind as we enter '23 and '24. And the other is around lower CapEx as we get into particularly '24 and beyond. So that, combined with the working capital opportunities we see from performance-based payment timing and incentive timing, really make us optimistic about that really strong CAGR over the next couple of years. Now of course, the corollary there is that puts us in a nice position to be able to return a healthy volume of cash to our shareholders. And we've noted on this call and others that, that remains our top priority for cash deployment over the next couple of years with $1.5 billion as our repo target in 2022, for example. So while I wouldn't read too carefully into a specific sales or margin target in these out-years related to cash, we'll get more into that guidance as we get closer to those years. Certainly, we'll look to continue to grow the company and deliver strong performance along the way.
Kathy Warden: Part of what you are asking is what is our outlook. And while we're not going to provide specific numbers, as Dave said, I'll point you to some of the comments that I made. We expect continued top line growth in this business beyond 2022. And we expect the earnings expansion. And so those are factored in, both to our 2023 and 2024 expectations for cash. And you can draw some conclusion that we see an accelerated growth profile going from '23 into '24 on earnings. And that would be a fair assumption to make as well based on what we've outlined for you.
Doug Harned: And then just as a follow-up, one piece of this. If I go back a few years, missiles was one of the hottest areas in the budget. And I know we had this discussion around really Northrop Grumman working to become a third missile supplier. But over that time period, we've seen essentially missile budgets turn over and legacy, certainly, a lot of the large legacy programs, demand is considerably less. You've got some important programs now and missiles development programs, but how do you see that market? Is this still the same kind of opportunity you were looking at a few years ago?
Kathy Warden: Doug, when we were looking at this a few years ago, I would say our expectations were more balanced between space and missile. And what we've seen is space has outperformed our expectations. Missiles has been more in line to date with expectations, maybe not as much opportunity as we project out into the out-years, but space is more than offsetting that. And we feel we've gotten a return on investment. I will say that we continue to be a strong merchant supplier in the missiles space. And so as that market continues to grow and expand -- and we do expect it will, particularly in hypersonics, we are partnered with the larger weapons providers to provide them important components of those weapon systems. And so we, by no means, believe that our return on investment is not maturing in the weapons space. It's just maturing more quickly and more significantly in space.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Research.
Robert Stallard: I had a follow-up on Doug's question really, and that's Slide 12. And you've got that projected large pickup in free cash flow in 2024. I was wondering if you could maybe qualitatively walk through what some of the moving parts are leading to that particularly strong growth in a couple of years' time?
David Keffer: Sure. Happy to. Like I mentioned, the 10-plus percent CAGR over the next couple of years really shows up particularly strongly in that 2024 time line. And it's for a couple of the reasons that we've described, and I'll go into a bit more detail on those. One is around our expectation of lower CapEx in 2024. We've talked about that coming down gradually as a percentage of sales, and we start to see that in our '22 and '23 guidance. As we get to '24, we expect that to continue to come down on a dollar basis and a percentage of sales as we see the level of demand for CapEx beginning to decline a bit further in '24. On the working capital side, we have quite a few programs, obviously, none of them of too much significance in the overall sales or balance sheet of the company. But when we aggregate all of that, we see more opportunity for working capital efficiency drives in that '24 time line than we do in '22 or '23, given the timing of some particular performance-based payments and milestones and incentives. So we're excited about the opportunity as we look at '24 and beyond for free cash improvement. And of course, for the flexibility that, that provides us on the deployment side as well. I mentioned the other factor earlier, which is more just the timing of the payroll tax deferral that we had as a benefit in 2020 that we're now paying half of in '21 and '22. So that's the only kind of unique item I'd add to that mix. Hope that helps.
Robert Stallard: So it doesn't sound like there's anything really on the operations side that's massively accelerating in '24. It's sort of nonoperating items then.
David Keffer: I think that's a good way to characterize it. I think Kathy covered well our expectations for growth and performance over the next couple of years and these cash flow timing issues are layered onto that outlook.
Robert Stallard: Yes. Okay. And then just a quick follow-up on the cash. You mentioned that the -- if they don't sort out this R&D tax credit thing, it could be $1 billion hit in '22. What's your latest thinking on the potential hit in '23 and '24, if this legislation doesn't get changed?
David Keffer: Yes. Thanks for the follow-up question on that. I should note it's approximately 20% lower per year after 2022, not exactly given some of the idiosyncrasies in the timing and such. But think of that $1 billion in '22 potential coming down to about $800 million and $600 million over the next 2 years. As you can imagine, it eventually levels off and normalizes when we get to 2026 or so. So we are certainly still optimistic about resolving Section 174 through deferral or repeal. In the meantime, there continues to be good, broad bipartisan support for doing so. It's really just a matter of finding the right legislative vehicle. And of course, that has proven challenging so far. So that's why we wanted to give you a sense for that volume on today's call.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.
Noah Poponak: The profit margins in space have come down as you've layered in a significant amount of new revenue. As the growth rate sort of transitions there, how should we think about how much recovery you could see in the profitability in that business?
Kathy Warden: So Noah, if I look at that business, we continue to layer in new development work. We talked about a few of those things today: the glide phase interceptor, the NGI program. And so it's not just the GBSD phenomena that is causing that mix headwind. But as GBSD transition from a development phase even into the early stages of production, we would expect to see that be the biggest driver in a tailwind to margin rate. And that happens around the middle of the decade. In the meantime, that business continues to perform exceptionally well, and the margin rate for our space business are very solid in comparison to others. So we're really pleased with that performance as we ingest all of this development work and believe that we can maintain those rates in line with what we have projected for 2022 and see increases towards the middle of the decade.
Noah Poponak: Great. Understood. And then, Dave, just quickly following up on that -- on the free cash flow math. If I take each of the years you've now provided, back out the CapEx and then back out all the pension inputs you've provided, which sort of gets to a clean number relative to the business segments excluding anything with cash tax or working capital. That number as a ratio of the business segments is pretty low compared to where you've been in the past. So that would indicate that you are specifically assuming a working capital headwind or some other headwind outside of the business segments. Is that the case? Or is my math wrong?
David Keffer: Sure. Happy to get into those details another time if you'd like to dig further.
Noah Poponak: Yes, it could be easier with the same numbers in front of us.
David Keffer: Right, exactly. In aggregate, I think the important headline here is we've had great working capital performance over the last couple of years. We project more stable working capital performance over the next couple of years before seeing that opportunity expand again in 2024. And I think that may be the summary of what you're seeing is after a couple of years of just outstanding working capital performance, especially in 2020, when we had things like the progress payment improvement and other tailwinds from the kind of industry perspective on cash. We're in a more normalized period in 2022 and 2023, before seeing that opportunity expand again in '24. So again, happy to follow up with that sometime. But I think that gives you a feel for it.
Noah Poponak: It does. But it's not -- you're not assuming an actual incremental working capital headwind, '22, '23. It's just sort of relatively no change year-over-year.
David Keffer: Yes. That's correct.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.
Cai von Rumohr: Yes. So I mean, it's pretty clear that in space, your mix is shifting toward GBSD and NGI. And so I assume that's, because they're in the development stage, means lower margins '22, probably '23. And therefore, maybe '24, they move up, but that would be the profile for space. And you mentioned in aeronautical that you saw a reversal in '24, but you mentioned dissipation in '23 of headwinds. I read dissipation, meaning that margins can get better in '23. But does dissipation mean it's just going to go down but not quite at the same level? So I guess, the bottom line is for -- looking at the total company, '24, '25, we can see the margins maybe getting better, but maybe they're flat to down over the next 2 years. Is that a fair assessment?
Kathy Warden: At the company level, Cai, what we are seeing is continued growth on the top line and margin expansion opportunity. But just as we've demonstrated, right, we've seen 40 basis points of improvement going from '20 to '21. As we look at 2022, we're holding that range constant with where we ended 2021, and that's largely because we have offset these mix pressures as we've brought more development work into the portfolio. And so what we are suggesting is that, that would continue to be the case until we move the mix more in the direction of production. But we are having performance improvements and cost efficiencies that are providing tailwinds on margin rates. So you would expect us to continue to work those levers even with this current mix, and we see opportunity for margins even as we look into 2023.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Myles Walton with UBS.
Myles Walton: Kathy, I was wondering if you could comment on the backlog and bookings opportunities in '22. And F-35, NGI, I imagine, are big movers there. But do you expect the year to end at a higher backlog? And then, Dave, just a clarification on the $1.7 billion of prepaid credit. It's not clear that you ever recover that based on the slide of funding and CAS recoveries. Can you just clarify?
Kathy Warden: I'll start with your question about year '22 awards and backlog expectations. We do not expect to have book-to-bill of 1 in 2022. We see fewer new competitive opportunities this year. It's just timing. And we also see fewer multiyear awards, with the exception being the AS F-35 award, which has pushed into this year. We tend not to focus so much on singular year book-to-bill but instead a longer-term view because we have so many multiyear awards. And as Dave mentioned, when we look at the last 3 years, our average book-to-bill was 1.22. So it established a really strong foundation for us to continue to grow. As we look at this year, we still expect to end this year with 4-year then trailing average of over 1.1. So it just gives you a sense that we expect to not only have a strong backlog, but an average book-to-bill that continues to support the growth that we are outlining into the future.
David Keffer: And then just briefly on the $1.7 billion CAS prepayment credit. We show you the next 3 years of current projections in a multi-decade future for our pension plans, both from a FAS and CAS perspective. And so wouldn't indicate that we'd expect that to be final or resolved over the next 3 years in this particular forecast period. We've got many, many years ahead of us there, a lot of market movement ahead of us there. But I think the bottom line on the pension side is we're really enthusiastic about the continued double-digit return performance in 2021, and that has put us at a better funded position than we've been at in many years. So really a good news story as of today on the pension side of things.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Richard Safran with Seaport Global.
Richard Safran: I wanted to ask you, if I could, a capital deployment question. In 2021, you had adjusted free cash flow of $3.1 billion, but you paid $4.7 billion in dividends and repurchases. With respect to the long-term free cash flow guide and expectations to return the majority of free cash flow to shareholders, I'm trying to get a sense of what majority means and if your actions in '21 reflect how you're thinking long term about capital deployment. For example, could you draw down the balance sheet cash a bit further? Given the recent credit upgrade, are you planning any -- on retiring any more debt? Just was curious about, given your long-term cash flow guide, how you might be thinking about capital deployment over the longer term.
Kathy Warden: Yes. And let me just start with this past year. We had the IT services divestiture, which generated cash that we also deployed back into the business, as we committed we would. And so that's what drove that higher level of capital deployment opportunity even above our free cash flow in 2021. As we're looking forward, when we talk about majority of our cash being returned to shareholders, we talked about at least $1.5 billion of share repurchase this year, and that is against the $2.6 billion at the midpoint or so of our guide in free cash flow. So -- and of course, dividends on top of that, which we have committed to continue paying competitive dividend, which our Board will take up again early this year. So that gives you a sense of what we mean by majority. There's also opportunity in that we have paid down debt and really solidified our balance sheet. So we currently have a cash balance that's higher than what we have stated our target to be, which is around $2 billion. And so that gives us some flexibility as we look at not only 2022 but beyond as well. And we really don't have any major debt tranches coming due. We have 1 in 2023 that we've outlined, but we have flexibility on whether to refinance or to pay that at this point based on where our credit rating sits. So that's how we're thinking about capital deployment.
Richard Safran: Okay. And just real quick, your contract mix right now, roughly 50-50 cost plus fixed price. I'm just wondering if you -- again, thinking longer term, how you think that might trend when you might start thinking about when the portfolio starts leaning towards more fixed-price contracts? Is that something that's a '23 or possibly '24 event?
Kathy Warden: It gets a little higher over the next couple of years, never significantly out of balance with that 50-50 ratio. And then in 2025 is when we expect it to start to shift in the other direction.
Todd Ernst: All right. We have time for one more question.
Operator: Your last question is from the line of Robert Spingarn with Melius Research.
Robert Spingarn: This actually touches on contract type. Seth asked about the longer-term, end of decade aeronautics revenues. I wanted to ask about the risk profile and classified aeronautics nearer term as certain programs transition from development to LRIP. And just especially in light of the cost pressure, supply chain and so forth.
Kathy Warden: So as we look at our classified portfolio, just as we do on all of our programs, we incorporate those low-rate, initial production lots that were priced into our estimate-at-complete process. And so we're looking at that on an ongoing basis. That risk is not only being monitored, but reflected in our financial statements based on expectations as we know them today. And so the production experience that we have, even early on in test aircraft and such, all inform how we think about those low-rate initial production lots.
Robert Spingarn: Is there a way to talk about how the revenues transition in '22 from cost plus to fixed price? Or is this all in '23?
Kathy Warden: So not at a particular program level, but we do talk about that in aggregate. And so as I said, our balance, even in aeronautics being specific to the sector, is about 50-50. And we expect that to continue to be the case in 2022. So I think we are out of time. I'm going to go ahead and wrap up. Thanks again for joining us today. Again, I wanted to thank our team also for another strong year in 2021 and for positioning us so well for 2022 and beyond. We had solid performance, and our innovation and investments are positioning us to continue delivering the products that our customers want with the urgency that they need. So thanks again for your support. We look forward to talking to you in April.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-10-28 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's Third Quarter 2021 Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. My name is Catherine and I will be your operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. If at any time during the call you require assistance, please press star 0 and an operator will be happy to assist you. I'd now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Todd Ernst, Treasurer and Vice President Investor Relations. Mr. Ernst, please proceed.
Todd Ernst: Thanks, Catherine. And good morning, everyone. Welcome to Northrop Grumman's Third Quarter 2021 conference call. We will refer to a PowerPoint presentation that is posted on the IR webpage. Before we start, matters discussed on today's call, including 2021 guidance and beyond, reflect the Company's judgment based on information available at the time of this call, they constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to Safe Harbor Provisions of federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which are noted in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties may cause actual Company results to differ materially. Today's call will include non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to our GAAP results in our earnings release. On the call, today, are Kathy Warden, our Chairman, CEO, and President, and Dave Keffer our CFO. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Kathy. Kathy.
Kathy Warden: Thank you Todd. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us. We delivered another quarter of strong results in an increasingly complex environment. In the last quarter, we've seen developments in the global fight against COVID-19 and macroeconomic changes such as the tightening labor market, supply chain challenges, and growing inflation. But we've also seen evolving threats to our national security, which have further eliminated the value of Northrop Grumman products and services. On today's call, we will provide insights into these developments and their effects on our business to date, as well as discuss our third-quarter performance results and provide our updated outlook for this year and an initial look at 2022. I'd like to thank our employees and our extended Northrop Grumman team, including our suppliers, for their relentless focus on delivering for our customers and our shareholders. I am proud of how our team has demonstrated remarkable resiliency and adaptability during these dynamic time. Our Company continues to deliver strong operating performance. As we announced earlier today, we had a segment operating margin rate of 11.9% in the third quarter and year-to-date an exceptional segment operating margin rate of 12%. In addition, earnings per share in the quarter were $6.63, an increase of 13% compared to last year. And our transaction adjusted free cash generation continues to be strong, increasing 15% year-to-date. We ended the quarter with just over $4 billion in cash, providing significant flexibility in support of our capital deployment initiative. With respect to the top-line, our year-to-date organic growth was 8%. This robust growth reflects the alignment and strength of our broad portfolio to our customers priorities and future needs. As expected, our organic growth rate slowed in the quarter from the rapid pace that we saw in the first half of the year. In addition to having viewing -- fewer working days in the second half of the year, which we discussed on each of our last two calls. We are also seeing an impact on our sales from the broader economic environment due to COVID-19. During the third quarter, this included employee leave-taking at a higher level than planned, a tighter labor market, and certain supply chain challenges. We continue to focus on the safety and well-being of our employees, customers, and partners as we work to mitigate the impact of these factors. As you know, the President recently issued an Executive Order generally requiring employees or federal contractors, to be fully vaccinated by early December. We have shared the details to this mandate with our U.S. workforce and we are working to help them meet the requirements. We also increased our hiring plans for the fourth quarter to help mitigate the potential impact of any increased attrition. Based on the team's strong third quarter performance, and in consideration of macroeconomic factors as we see them today, we are increasing our guidance for segment OM and EPS for the year, and narrowing our sales guidance to approximately 36 billion. Dave will provide more details on the quarter, our updated guide, as well as our initial outlook for 2022. Turning to budget updates from Washington, we're seeing strong bipartisan support for national security broadly and Northrop Grumman programs specifically. We're pleased that an agreement was reached on the continuing resolution and debt-ceiling that will fund the government through December third. We are hopeful that Congress will finalized the fiscal year 2022 appropriations and avoid a protracted continuing resolution. With respect to the FY 22 defense budget overall, we see bipartisan support for increased defense spending, including adding funding above the president's budget request. We are hopeful that this additional funding will be supported in final appropriations. Over the past several weeks, senior customers, members of Congress, and the administration officials has made increasingly public comments about strategic competition in the national security environment and the need to counter and deter evolving threats. One clear and consistent message has been the need to investing, and more rapidly field advanced capabilities. Our Company's portfolio and capabilities are strongly aligned to the find national security priority areas, particularly in advanced weapons, strategic deterrence, Mission Systems, and Space. And we're using digital technologies to develop and deploy capabilities faster and more efficiently than ever before across our entire portfolio. I'll share a few highlights to demonstrate how our performance today continues to position us for the future. With the emergence of more sophisticated Air Defense Systems, the need for standoff capabilities and speed to target is critical for our customers. To address this requirement, Northrop Grumman developed our gum ER a high-speed long-range Air-To-Ground Missile. And in the third quarter, after just 28 months in engineering, manufacturing and development, we achieved a critical milestone, clearing the way for production. In September, we received our first low rate initial production award for the program. Also during the quarter, we along with our industry partner Raytheon, successfully tested the hypersonic air-breathing weapon concept known as Hawk. know as HAWC. Northrop Grumman's supplies to scram Jet Propulsion system for HAWC, allowing speeds of greater than Mach 5 (ph) argum ER and HAWC are just two examples of how we're providing the higher speed and longer-range weapons needed to be relevant in today's threat environment. Another key area where we are supporting our customers, is in the need and urgency to enhance our country's strategic deterrence capability. Especially in light of recent disclosures of investments, other nations are making in modernizing their strategic capabilities. The triad is the foundation of the security strategy for the U.S. and its allies and it's been an effective deterrent for decades, preserving peace and detouring aggression. As highlighted by recent customer and administration comments, modernizing the Tri-Ed remains a high priority. Northrop Grumman is the prime on likes of the Tri-Ed with the bomber and strategic missiles, and we are a significant supplier for submarines as well. For the bomber, the B-21 program continues to advance. As air force secretary Frank Kendall recently noted, there are now 5 units in various stages of production. And the systems are in his word, making good progress to real fielded capability. For strategic missiles, we continue to make solid progress on the EMD portion of the Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent program. We completed key milestones earlier this year, and we are tracking toward our first flight as planned. The GBSD program has ramped significantly this year, and we now expect that it will add just over 1billion in incremental revenue to our 2021 results, and another approximately 500 million of incremental revenue in 2022. For both the 21 and GBSD, we have applied digital transformation concepts as a key enabler to reduce risk, increased productivity, shorten cycle time, and improve the system's ability to adapt to changing threat. In today's rapidly changing threat environment, our Mission Systems portfolio, including in communications and artificial intelligence, is making a critical contribution in the advancement of technology and capability needed to allow legacy platform to be more capable, and survivable, and therefore more relevant towards addressing the increasingly sophisticated threats. To this end during the third quarter, our next-generation electronic warfare system, which will equip domestics, had its first test flight on a testbed aircraft at the Northern lightning exercise. This system in conjunction with our Saber radar, demonstrated full interoperability in a stimulated contested electromagnetic spectrum environment. With the radio frequency spectrum becoming increasingly contested. That's critical set of electronic warfare capabilities will allow the platform to remain survivable. We anticipate EMD contract for next-generation electronic warfare in 2022 with an overall lifetime opportunity of up to $3 billion. And in missile defense, emerging threats from hypersonic missiles are creating new challenges for customers. We're helping to provide differentiated solutions to these challenges by applying our advanced technology and domain expertise. Earlier this year, we were awarded a contract to deliver prototypes satellite as part of the MDA's hypersonic and ballistic tracking space sensor program. This program is designed to detect and track hypersonic vehicles, which have a very different flight profile and signature than ballistic missiles. They required new sensing capabilities in order to detect and track them. In September, we conducted a successful HV TSS critical design review and are progressing towards a 2023 launch. In a Space domain, Northrop Grumman is working with our customers on advanced capabilities to address a range of new and evolving threats. Many of these programs are classified and consistent with increased demand in this area, we received $1.2 billion in restricted space awards in the third quarter. I've touched on several major contributions that we've made this quarter to national security, all of which highlight our strong performance, technology, leadership, and broad portfolio. I also want to share examples to our collaboration with partners to accelerate innovation in create discriminating technologies. As I've noted before, we are actively engaging and partnering with early stage technology and non-traditional defense companies. In the quarter, we closed an investment in orbit fab, a space logistics Company whose goal is to put gas stations in space. Their vision fits well with our on-orbit satellite refueling and Space logistics capabilities. We also continue to work with Deepwave Digital, an innovative Company we invested in at the end of last year. Deepwave Digital provides a hardware and software solution enabling very efficient AI enhanced software-defined radios for deep learning applications at the edge, which we believe will enhance our efforts in both autonomy and jets C2. These partnerships, as well as other venture investments, support our strategy to create solutions at speed for our customer's toughest national security challenges. Now, I will turn the call over to Dave, who will provide more detail on our Third Quarter results, our updated 2021 guidance, and our 2022 outlook. Dave?
Dave Keffer: Okay. Thanks, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin my comments with Third Quarter highlights on slide 3. We continued to generate strong operating results, delivering another quarter of solid organic sales growth, higher segment operating margin rate, and outstanding earnings per share, and transaction adjusted free cash flow. We continued to return cash to shareholders through our buyback program and quarterly dividend, returning over $800 million in the quarter. Slide 4 provides a bridge between third quarter 2020, and third quarter 2021 sales. Excluding sales from the IT services divestiture, our organic growth was three percent. This rate was below our first half growth due in part to the broader labor market and supply chain trends that Kathy outlined. Next, I will review our earnings per share results on Slide 5 compared to the Third Quarter of 2020, our EPS increased 13% to $6.63. Strong segment operational performance contributed about $0.14 of growth and lower corporate unallocated added another $0.55. This included a $60 million benefit from insurance settlements related to shareholder litigation involving the former Orbital ATK business prior to our acquisition. Corporate on allocated expense also decreased due to a change in deferred state income taxes, as well as lower intangible asset amortization and PP&E step-up depreciation. Pension costs contributed $0.17 of growth driven by higher non-service FAS income. Our marketable securities performance represented a headwind of $0.17 compared to the third quarter of 2020, which benefited from particularly strong equity markets. Lastly, we experienced a slightly higher federal tax rate in the period due to lower benefits from foreign derived Intangible Income. Turning to sector results on slide six, we saw some broad-based COVID -related impact. The most significant of which were in our Aeronautics sector. Aeronautics sales declined 6% for the quarter. Year-to-date it's sales are down 1%. As we've described in recent quarters, several programs in our AS portfolio are plateaus, or entering a phase of their life cycle where you would not expect to see growth. This quarter, we experienced slightly lower volume across the portfolio, including restricted efforts. F-35, B2B, DMS, and Global Hawk programs. We expect this overall trend to continue at AS in 2022, which we'll discuss in more detail momentarily. At defense systems, sales decreased by 24% in the quarter and 22% year-to-date. On an organic basis, sales were down roughly 2% in the quarter and year-to-date periods driven by the completion of our activities on the Lake City, small-caliber ammunition contract last year. Lake City represented a sales headwind of roughly $75 million in the quarter and $335 million year-to-date. This was partially offset by higher volume on several mission readiness programs. Mission Systems sales were down 5% in the quarter, and up 4% year-to-date. Organically, MS sales increased 1% in Q3, and year-to-date, they're up a robust 9%. As we've noted previously, the timing of material volume at MS has been weighted more towards the first half of 2021 than the second. Organic sales growth in the third quarter and year-to-date periods was broad-based across programs such as Gator, J Crew, and various restricted efforts. Finally, based systems continues to deliver outstanding sales growth, increasing 22% in the third quarter and 28% year-to-date. Sales in both business areas were higher in the quarter and year-to-date periods, reflecting continued ramp-up on GBSD and NGI, as well as higher volume unrestricted programs and Artemis. Turning to Segment Operating income and Margin rate on slide 7, we delivered another quarter of excellent performance, with segment operating margin rate at 11.9%. Aeronautics Third Quarter operating income decreased 10% due to lower sales volume and a $42 million unfavorable EAC adjustment on the F-35 program. The adjustment was driven by labor-related production inefficiencies, reflecting COVID related impacts on the program. The AS Operating margin rate decreased to 9.7% in Q3 as a result of this adjustment, with year-to-date operating margin slightly ahead of last year at 10.1%. Defense Systems operating income decreased by 19% in the quarter and 16% year-to-date, largely due to the impact of the IT services divestiture. Operating margin rate increased to 12.4% in the quarter and 12 percent year-to-date, largely driven by improved performance in contract mix, in battle management and missile systems, partially offset by lower net favorable EAC adjustments. At mission systems, operating income was relatively flat in the quarter and up 10% year-to-date, third quarter operating margin rate improved to 15.3% in year-to-date was 15.5%, reflecting strong program performance and changes in business mix as a result of the IT services divestiture. Space Systems operating income rose 29% in the quarter, and 36% year-to-date, driven by higher sales volume. Operating margin rate was also higher at 10.7% in the quarter and 10.9% year-to-date, driven by higher net favorable EAC adjustments. Moving to sector guidance on slide 8, note that this outlook assumes a relatively consistent level of impact in Q4 with what we've been experiencing so far this year from the effects of COVID on the workforce and supply chain. And it does not include any potential financial impacts on the Company related to the vaccine mandate. We have updated our 2021 sales estimates for each segment based on our year-to-date results and current expectations for Q4. For operating margin rate, we're increasing our guidance at defense and Space, and the margin rates at AS and MS remain unchanged. Before we get to our consolidated guidance, I'd also like to take a moment to discuss some of the factors to consider in comparing our fourth-quarter revenue to last year on Slide 9. In Q4 of 2020, the IT services business contributed almost $600 million of sales and the equipment sale at AS generated over $400 million. Q4 of 2021 also has 4 fewer working days than the same period in 2020, representing a headwind of about 6%. Adjusting for these 3 items, our Q4 2021 sales would grow at 3% to percent based on our latest full-year guidance. Moving to slide 10. Based on what we now see, we expect sales of approximately $36 billion. We're raising our 2021 outlook for segment and total operating margin and for EPS. Our segment operating margin rate guidance is 10 basis points higher at 11.7% to 11.9%, reflecting our continued strong performance. Our net FAS/CAS, pension adjustment has increased $60 million for the full year. As a result of the annual demographic update we performed in Q3. Other corporate unllocated costs are $70 million below our previous guidance. Now at approximately $120 million for the year. As I mentioned, our corporate unallocated costs benefited from a $60 million insurance settlement in Q3, as well as additional benefits from state taxes. These updates translate into an increase of 50 basis points in our operating margin rate to a range of 16% to 16.2% in our updated guidance. Remember that the gain from the IT services divestiture in Q1 contributed approximately 5 percentage points of overall operating margin benefit for the full year. We continue to project the 2021 effective federal tax rate in the high 17% range, excluding the effects of the divestiture, which is consistent with our prior guidance. Lastly, we're raising our EPS guidance, which we'll cover on Slide 11. Segment performance is contributing about $0.15 of the increase, with the benefits to corporate on allocated and pension contributing the remainder. In total, this represents an $0.80 improvement in our transaction adjusted EPS guidance. With this latest increase our 2021 EPS guidance is up by about $2 since our initial guidance in the beginning of the year. Before we move to 2022, I wanted to give you an update on our cash performance. Year-to-date, we have generated over $2.1 billion of transaction adjusted free cash flow up 15 percent compared to 2020. And we ended the quarter with over $4 billion in cash on the balance sheet. Keep in mind that we have a roughly $200 million payroll tax payment in Q4 from the Cares Act legislation. With the second similar payment in 2022. Additionally, we expect to pay the balance of our transaction-related tax from the IT services divestiture in the fourth quarter. Our healthy cash position has enabled us to repurchase over $2.7 billion of stocks so far this year, on track with our full-year target of $3 billion or more. As we look ahead to 2022 on slide 12, our outlook is based on the same set of assumptions that we described for 2021 guidance, regarding the COVID environment and vaccine mandate. It also assumes that the continuing resolution does not extend beyond 2021, and like our 2021 guidance, it assumes that we do not experience a b reach of the debt ceiling. We expect space to be our fastest-growing segment again in 2022, driven by GBSD, NGI and several restricted efforts as they continue to ramp. Mission Systems and Defense Systems should also produce organic growth. Regarding Aeronautics Systems, after several years of strong growth, our latest 2021 sales guidance calls for a mid-single-digit decline. And we see that trend continuing in 2022. We've talked in recent quarters about the headwinds in our hail portfolio. We're also projecting lower sales on Jay stars, F/A-18, as well as our restricted portfolio. Looking further to the future, it's an exciting decade for defense aerospace. Rapidly evolving threats are sparing a new wave of all-time this vehicle, and 6th-generation fighter development. So the opportunity set in AS remains solid. And we will continue to invest in the cutting-edge technologies that allow our customers to stay ahead of the threat environment. Altogether, we currently expect 2022 sales at the Company level to reflect continued organic growth. Looking at segment margin, we expect the strong results we've demonstrated in 2021 to continue in 2022 with excellent program performance, offsetting a portion of the 20 to 30 basis point benefit we generated from pension-related overhead rate changes in Q1 of 2021. While we project higher sales and strong segment operating margin, we expect transaction adjusted earnings per share to be down next year as a result of several non-operational headwinds. Lower CAS pension recoveries, and higher corporate unallocated expenses are currently projected to create an EPS headwind next year of more than $2. For FAS pension, our outlook for 2022 will depend on our updated actuarial assumptions, including discount rates and plan asset returns, which we will determine at the end of the year. Earnings per share driven from sales growth, strong operating margin performance, and lower share count will help to offset these non-operational items. Next, I'd like to spend a moment discussing cash. We expect relatively stable cash flow at the program level in 2022. But there are a few temporal items that should be factored into the year-over-year comparison of overall free cash flow. First is lower CAS pension recoveries. As you can see on Slide 13, our CAS recoveries are currently expected to be lower by $350 million next year. The second is cash taxes. Excluding the impact of the IT services transaction we expect cash taxes to be modestly higher next year. In addition, as we've noted in the past, current tax law would require companies to amortize costs, so we're 5 years starting in 2022, which would increase our cash taxes by around $1 billion next year in smaller amounts in subsequent years. There continues to be uncertainty in the tax environment with potential new legislation that could change the R&D amortization provision and other provisions. We will provide updates on each of these items on our January call. Taking all of these cash flow factors into consideration, we would expect to decline in 2022 transaction adjusted free Cash Flow, followed by a double-digit growth CAGR through 2024, driven by strong operational performance. Regarding capital deployment, investing in the business through disciplined R&D and capital spending continues to be our priority. We expect CAPEX to be roughly flat next year in absolute dollar terms. We believe these investments allow us to stay at the forefront of technology as we invest in our business. As we've said, we continue to expect to return the majority of our 2022 free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. With that, I will turn the call back over to you, Kathy.
Kathy Warden: Thanks, Dave. In summary, we have delivered excellent year-to-date results and operating performance, and we are pleased to be increasing our full-year EPS Guidance for the third consecutive quarter. We are actively engaged with our supply chain and our employees as we work to mitigate broader COVID related risks and continue to keep our programs on track. As shown by the many milestones in the quarter, we have highly relevant capabilities and programs that align well to national security requirements, and our customer funding priorities. So as we look forward, 2022 is expected to deliver another year of organic sales growth and excellent performance paving the way for longer term, margin expansion, and free cash flow growth. We remain focused on protecting the safety and well-being of our employees, delivering the capabilities our customers need to protect national security and sustain our planet and delivering value to our shareholders. So, with that Catherine, if you would please open the phone line for questions.

And your first question comes from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research.
Robert Stallard: Good morning.
Kathy Warden: Good morning. Rob.
Robert Stallard: Kathy or Dave, just on the 2022 expectations for AS, your decline that you're expecting -- I was wondering if you could give a little bit more detail on the puts and takes, consciously you can't talk that much about classified, but if you could give some sort of scale of the moving parts, that would be very helpful. Thank you.
Dave Keffer: Sure, Robert, I can touch on that a bit further. As we mentioned, we're projecting a mid-single-digit growth decline this year in AS, and that's about the same trend that we anticipate next year in light of where we are in the life cycle of a lot of our key programs in A.S at this point. There is no single factor or even 2 or 3 factors that contribute the lion's share of that decline, but rather a fairly consistent trend in the trajectory across a lot of our key programs in the sector. You mentioned, we can't say much about our restricted portfolio, certainly agreed on that front. We have mentioned that the Global Hawk portfolio is projected to decline next year as black 20's and 30's continue in their retirement process. F-18 is projecting a decline for our portion of that program. Jay stars is another -- I would highlight there. And so across the board, these are fairly consistent drivers, F-35, we've talked about some of the COVID impacts there in Q3. And it's kind of pattern going forward in the AS portion of the program is relatively flat to modestly declining as we look at the '22 outlook. So hopefully that gives you a sense of some of the key drivers, as I mentioned, it's not anyone's specific program.
Robert Stallard: And just a quick follow up Dave -- sorry.
Kathy Warden: Quickly Rob, the only thing I would add is that our AS sector has been and we expect may continue to be the most impacted by the COVID related challenges that we spoke about.
Robert Stallard: Just a follow-up. Do you think 2022 is likely the trough for these issues as some of these other less mature programs start to grow in 23 beyond?
Dave Keffer: Obviously, we'll provide more insight on 2023 as we get to a similar point in 2022, and throughout the year, we will talk more about specific programs within that portfolio. I think for some, the trends will continue, for others they won't and we will defer to later date to give you more specifics as we look at the 23 outlook and beyond.
Robert Stallard: Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with UBS.
Myles Walton: Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping
Kathy Warden: Good morning.
Myles Walton: You could touch a bit on the cash commentary for 22 and just so we can all get to the same base level, you're thinking about, Dave. Is that -- when you talk about the cash taxes being a headwind, is that assuming the amortization rule sticks around and you have that billion-dollar headwind? Are you taking cash taxes or headwind? Regardless, and then a similar question related to the double-digit growth through 2024.
Dave Keffer: Sure. So, the kind of high level view we gave you on 22 through 24 assumes that the amortization of those R&D costs does not go into effect. Though the trend line would be similar, it would be lowest in 22 with an increase in 23 and 24. But let's talk about it, assuming that guidance does not go into effect. What I think you can expect from us in '22 is to continue to drive a similar volume of working capital improvements to what we've done this year, which certainly had a good track record over the last couple of years of working capital efficiency across our business and that will help to provide that steady level of program driven cash that we talked about on the call. We also talked about pretty steady capex next year, slightly lower as a percentage of sales. With the sales growth, but a fairly consistent volume on a dollar basis. That means the kind of non-operating items or what we expect to provide the year-over-year reduction, $350 million less cash pension recovery is what we project today. I think of that more as a purification of our free cash flow stream. That day was going to come for a while and so, we're reaching that point now where we've reached the sustainably lower level of cash reimbursement. On the cash tax side, we'd projected those would be modestly higher without the R&D amortization provision, or other changes in the rate or other key provisions legislatively. Of course, legislation could then change that further if we don't have a removal or for all of the R&D tax item, for example. So more to come on, all of those fronts on the January call.
Myles Walton: Okay.
Dave Keffer: But hopefully that gives you a sense for it today. As we think about '23 and '24, we do expect continued decline in capital expenditures as a percent of sales. We will also benefit from not having the payroll tax to payroll in '23 and '24 as we have in '21 and '22, and at the program level, we expect continued working capital efficiencies on some of our key programs in '23 and '24, which is what gives us the confidence in that increase in those years.
Myles Walton: Okay, and just one quick clarification. The prior CAS outlook had slightly moderate growth in CAS recoveries in '23, that trend line still holds?
Dave Keffer: At this point, yes. I think --
Myles Walton: Okay.
Dave Keffer: You'll see much less significant changes in 23 and 24, again, based on what we see today and based on the actuarial environment today. From 21 to 22, as well as 20 to 21, we've had significant reductions in cash recovery. We no longer expect significant movement really in either direction in those out-years.
Myles Walton: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein.
Doug Harned: Good morning. Thank you. I want to go back to Aeronautics. And when you described the lower Aeronautics revenues in 2022, you referred to opportunities long term to reverse that, those were things like the sixth-gen fighter, new autonomous systems. But I think of those as being fairly long term and fairly uncertain. If you look at that revenue trajectory, the B-21, we should certainly see a strong growth come about from that. Do you see that as sufficient to reverse this trend? And when might that grow to a point that we would see that?
Dave Keffer: Sure, Doug, obviously that's one that we can't get into much detail on, and so I guess, I'll refer you to the overall trends that programs tend to see as they're in these phases of the lifecycle that we've described on B-21 and maybe more importantly that our customer has described on that program. Certainly it has been a contributor to our growth as in the restricted AS portfolio over the last several years as we've described but the go-forward trajectory and the pace and timing of that growth is something we can't say much more about. So we've given you a sense for the 22 outlook there and where the program stands in its life cycle and that's about what we're able to say at this phase.
Doug Harned: Okay. If I switched to F-35 and perhaps go outside of Aeronautics, I think of the kinds of things that you're doing on the F-35 is right at the heart of tech refresh 3 systems upgrades. Now that has with it, I'd say some good news as there should be a lot of -- I would expect growth there. But, they have also been quite a few challenges that have been highlighted around tech refresh 3, can you talk about both the growth opportunity that you have on F-35 there, as well as how you're dealing with some of the challenges that have come up?
Kathy Warden: Sure, Doug, this is Kathy, I'll take that. So as you noted, there is opportunity, particularly in our Mission Systems sectors. We've look at the tech refresh on the F-35 and the Mission Systems that we provide to the aircraft. There has been some delays that has been noted this year. They have had some minimal impacts just on the timing of our work in the funding to support our work. But we have not experienced performance issues as a result of those delays, it's just shifted some sales out of this year into next. And in terms of our overall outlook for our Mission Systems work, we do see that and we think consistent in saying this as upside opportunity while the production volume is flat, and price pressure is driving overall production sales volume down slightly across the board. The other area you didn't ask about, sustainment continues to be an opportunity as well. And we see that in all three sectors that predominantly led through our Defense Systems business for the aircraft, the airframe, and our Mission Systems business with sustainment contracts for the Mission Systems.
Doug Harned: Very good. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Good morning, guys. Thank you for the time. Kathy, maybe to follow up on an earlier question, just thinking about the 2022 revenue framework, you noted Aeronautics is down, but GBSD is growing $500 million, which was less than what we thought. What are any other major headwinds. And if we roll it up, is it fair to think about 3% to 4% revenue growth for 2022? And maybe as a follow-up to that, you gave some space color. Maybe if you could just talk about how you think about the rest of the portfolio outside GBSD?
Kathy Warden: Yes, thanks for the question, Sheila. So to unpack the space growth for this year and the trends that we expect to continue into next year, GBSD has contributed roughly 50% -- a little bit over 50% to the sales growth in space in 2021. And we expect that trend to continue into 2022. To your point about 500 million of growth next calendar year being less than you might have anticipated, you might be looking at budget data which showed an incremental billion in each of the two years. But I'll remind you that a quarter at ' 22 government year is in 2021. So, we've seen a more significant ramp over the course of the 12 months in 2021, than we anticipate in our calendar year 2022. So, it's not a change in profile, it's nothing different. It's just how that fall into our calendar year. With regard to your broader question on how that translates to our outlook for the Company overall. I think it is safe at this point based on what we know today, to suggest that low-single-digit growth in 2022 is a reasonable expectation. At this point in the year, we see some COVID impacts that we've referenced. We saw them in 3Q. We're anticipating those to stay at that same level in Q4. But it is difficult to project what that impact maybe in early 2022, but what I will say is, we see those more as speed bumps than we do speed rumpers. Our fundamentals are intact, we have strong backlog, strong pipeline, and great portfolio alignment to budget priorities, so we still see the path to growth that we've been talking about. We just have some of these COVID, as I call them, speed bumps that we're working our way through. Hopefully that helps.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Sure. thank you so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America.
Ron Epstein: Good morning. Maybe just following up on a whole series of questions, Kathy. I because I think this is a question that's on a lot of people's mind. And obviously I'm not asking for guidance clearly, would be kind of out of the game, but how do we think about kind of medium-term growth, right? So when the speed bumps are behind us. And we're kind of in production on B-21, GBSD is kind of humming along. Whatever else is coming along. So if we step out over the next couple of years, how do we think about medium-term growth?
Kathy Warden: We see a path to continuing to grow this business and it's based not only on the strength of the backlog we have with programs you were referencing like B-21 and GBSD. But it's also a pipeline that includes continued new award and I highlighted a few of those today of programs that are roofing into phase where they will see production award in the next couple of years. We still see a path to growth over the medium-term, and it's just a matter of how quickly that growth comes in the next several quarters as a result of some slowdowns that we've seen. And I should say, Ron and I appreciate the opportunity to address that. We've seen fairly minimal supply chain impacts because we have a relatively high labor content on our jobs versus external supplier content. We've talked a bit about the leave taking that we saw being higher in the third quarter, but they up to is finite because as people take leave of course they're burning down their leave balances. And, when I look over a longer-term period at trends like labor market issues that may drive labor rates up or inflation, we have in the industry at one of the highest levels of cost plus work. So those costs get passed on and shared with our customer. Now I do want to emphasize that we in no way, it want to pass those costs onto our customers, so we are working to minimize those impacts for their benefit. But our shareholders, they're not carrying that exposure. So, I feel really good about the portfolio that we have in our ability to weather any of these short-term impacts or what we expect to be short-term impacts and still be on a path to grow.
Ron Epstein: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley.
Kristine Liwag: Hey, good morning guys.
Kathy Warden: Good morning.
Kristine Liwag: Kathy just following up on that supply chain challenge, can you provide more specifics in terms of what you're seeing, why they're more prevalent in Aeronautics versus the other segments? And also right on labor, if the vaccine mandate does come into effect December 8, how are you thinking about the potential impact?
Kathy Warden: So, we are implementing the vaccine requirements across our U.S. workforce as the mandate requires us to do. We are certainly early in our stage of collecting data about our employee status and have a good sense that a vast majority of our employees are vaccinated or in the process of being vaccinated, and with other employees, we are working through their options to meet that requirement by December 8, It's really too early to predict what those impacts might be until we have a better sense of, not just the pure quantum of employees who may not meet their requirement, but where they work and what they do in our Company and therefore, how we would mitigate those impact. But as I mentioned, we are proactively increasing our hiring now in anticipation that we may have some loss of workers. And we are ensuring that we have training and skill building programs in place. So, as we bring those new employees into the workplace they can get productive and efficient as quickly as possible. So actively working to mitigate impacts, they're just too difficult to really quantify for you at this time.
Kristine Liwag: Great. And the specifics on the supply chain challenges with Aeronautics?
Kathy Warden: For us, they've been relatively minimal as we have seen our own increases in leave taken, we've seen the same thing in our suppliers and that was primarily driven by 2 things in the third quarter. We estimate one was the delta variant. We saw increased case counts and therefore people out of the workforce while they either recovered from COVID or we're staying out based on close contact and we understood those supplier similar phenomenon. Then the other was that people had not been taking leave at the same rate, but as things started to open up, people actually took some well needed and deserved vacation. So, those are the two primary drivers that we saw and our suppliers saw the same which slowed down deliveries a bit. But as I noted, we see those as being temporal in that leave taking is somewhat limited at that point in time.
Kristine Liwag: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Hi Noah, your line is open.
Noah Poponak: Hi, can you hear me?
Kathy Warden: Yes. Good morning.
Noah Poponak: Hi. Good morning, everybody. Dave, in the cash flow projection that you talked about on I will tell you
Dave Keffer: Noah, we lost you. Are you there?
Operator: Can we get to the next question. I will go right back to Noah.
Dave Keffer: Sure.
Operator: We have David. Oh Noah, your line is open. Are you there?
Noah Poponak: Hi, sorry. Yeah, I was just wondering David, if you could speak to what you're assuming directionally from margins in that projection on a total Company basis. Thank you.
Dave Keffer: Sure. We're really pleased to have been able to increase our 2021 segment operating margin rate guidance for the 2nd time now to another ten-basis point increase this year. As we noted in 2022 we won't have the 20 to 30 basis point benefit that we have this year from the pension driven overhead rate benefits that we experienced in our EACs in the first quarter of the year.  And we anticipate being able to offset a portion of that reduction as we look to 2022. I don't think it's requires a specific assumption for '23 and '24 margin rate to get to the general trend that we're providing for those years. We'll be more specific about margin rate outlook as we get closer to those years. But, I think a relatively stable margin rate would get you to the trends that we've talked about in '23 and 4, with a healthy double-digit CAGR as it relates to free cash flow from the '22 base up to that '24 level. Again, no payroll tax deferral, a bit of efficiency on the capital expenditure side and some program-driven opportunities are what really drives that.
Noah Poponak: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss with Barclays.
David Strauss: Thanks for taking the question, Loraine (ph). Just Dave to follow up on that so I'm Clear. Your guiding segment margin overall lower versus I guess whatever that call it, 118 midpoint for 2021, you're guiding it lower in '22 and then in terms of free cash flow on an absolute basis is '23 and '24 free cash flow higher than 2021 transaction adjusted free cash flow just on an absolute basis?
Dave Keffer: Sure. Let me address both of those, David. On the segment OM rate, you're right to think about the 2 factors we've described in '22 compared with our increased guidance for 2021. We'll look to offset a portion of the 20 to the 30 basis points reduction that we would see from the absence of those rate benefits in '22, we'll look to offset a portion of that 20 to 30 basis points through continued strong operating performance, but not all of the 20 to 30 basis points on the OM rate side. And look, in terms of the 23 and 24 free cash flow, we've got a lot of moving pieces yet to be determined on the tech side, as we mentioned, things can continue to move as they often do on the pension side. Based on what we know today, I think what's best to say today as we anticipate that healthy growth outlook in 23 and 24, as we get to January and provide more specifics on the 22 level of free cash flow and know more than we could note today, in terms of tax legislation and such. We'll provide a bit further detail on the 23 and 24 growth rate in comparison to where we are today also.
David Strauss: All right, thank you.
Operator: Your Next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.
George Shapiro: Yes Dave, I wanted clarification when you say AS declined at a rate similar to 21, is that -- because organically it's more like down 2% with equipment sale s taken out of it or are you talking the 5% that you just see?
Dave Keffer: Right. We're comparing to the actual mid-single-digit decline in 2021 when we say we are having a -- expecting a similar trajectory in 2022. It's a good question. Thanks for the clarification, George.
George Shapiro: Okay. And then what changed, if anything, or what changed to -- that the CAS pension dropped so much next year? I know you've talked about it coming down, but I hadn't expected it to come down the magnitude that it is.
Dave Keffer: Sure. The $350 million number is pretty consistent with what we've been projecting in recent months and in the July and April earnings calls, there was legislation regarding pension earlier this year that affected some of the actuarial assumptions used for CAS purposes and reduced that number. Then the other factor is in 2021, that CAS number came up by about $60 million, as we noted on the call today. The compare from 2021 to 2022 got $60 million tougher, but the 22 level has been pretty stable for us since that new legislation came out in the spring.
George Shapiro: Okay. Thanks very much.
Dave Keffer: You bet.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen.
Cai Von Rumohr: Yes, thank you so much for taking the call. So by the middle of '22 we'll know about the R&D tax credit. And as you look at '23, '24, you're saying, "Hey, we don't have the payroll tax repayment. We have lower CapEx. We have better ops and we have less downside in terms of cas h". So your basically saying we're going to have considerably better cash flow. And you also have a strong balance sheet, good low net debt to EBITDA ratio. Your major peer, basically in a somewhat similar situation, although they have CAS going against them, has taken a more aggressive stance toward their strategic use of share repurchase and dividend hikes to return value to shareholders. Your situation looks actually similar, if not better. Is that something you would consider?
Kathy Warden: Cai, it's not just something We would consider we have been articulating throughout the year that we do see a majority of our free cash flow being returned to shareholders over this period and, it is in part by, we increased the dividend again this year and we have committed to at least $3 billion of share repurchase in 2021. You could expect to see those trends for cash returning to shareholders in the next couple of years as well.
Cai Von Rumohr: But actually Lockheed is implying that their net debt will go up, if you consider all of their number. So they're basically saying they're looking at net debt because EBITDA is going up, that basically increasing the net debt somewhat because of the strength of their balance sheet. Is that something you would consider or is it basically just the cash flow that's available?
Dave Keffer: Sure, Cai, I think you noted appropriately at the beginning that we'll know more in the next few quarters than we do today about tax legislation and other factors. We'll know more about the COVID environment, the budget environment and so, all of these are factors that we think about as we look at our capital allocation plans. I mean, Kathy's point is the important one around the priority for us over the next couple of years will remain first and foremost, after making critical investments in our businesses, we've said we will continue to do the next priority is around returning cash to shareholders over these next couple of years. Whether we choose to change our net debt balance over the next few years or not will in some ways be affected by those broader factors, and we'll update you and others as we know more and get into 2022 on that front.This year, we achieved our credit rating targets and feel like, we're in a good stable position there. So again, we'll know more and update you all, as we do.
Todd Ernst: And Catherine --
Cai Von Rumohr: Good answer. Thanks so much.
Todd Ernst: If we have more question.
Operator: Alright, your last question will come from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.
Seth Seifman: Great. Thanks very much. Thanks for getting me on. I think I got one more here. So, I guess as far as backlog, when would you expect backlog to stabilize and given the decline we've seen year-to-date in the Defense Systems backlog, what gives you confidence on the growth outlook there?
Kathy Warden: So, Seth, we see our book-to-bill being close to 1 again this year have been significant awards that we anticipate in the Fourth Quarter. And our backlog has grown over 90% since the end of 2017, so to your point is there -- we don't expect that kind of accelerated growth in our backlog it currently sits at over two times sales, so it's quite strong, and we feel supports the continued growth of the business for several years to come.
Seth Seifman: Great. [Indiscernible] then on defense?
Kathy Warden: Sure. What is the specific question on Defense [Indiscernible]?
Seth Seifman: Just that the Defense backlog has been down fairly significantly year-to-date and calling for growth next year. I know there are some kind of growth programs in that segment but what gives you confidence in the Defense Systems business growing next year?
Kathy Warden: That business also has some key awards in fourth quarter of this year that would position for its growth next year. We also in defense see it's our shortest cycle business, so they do tend to run more of a one-to-one backlog to sales ratio. And the only other thing I would point to there is we have been trailing off Lake City and that of course, has impacted new awards and a tough year-over-year compare. But as we look forward, that will stabilize in -- looking at the backlog to sales ratio in that business. Anything you add, Dave?
Dave Keffer: Yeah, of course, the year-over-year backlog comparisons in DS in particular would be affected by the divestiture of the IT services business to a lesser degree in MS and Space. But certainly, thinking of more of an organic change in that DS backlog is important in this particular year.
Seth Seifman: Great. Thank you very much.
Todd Ernst: I will leave it there, Kathy?
Kathy Warden: Yes, well, once again, I want to thank the Northrop Grumman for delivering another solid quarter. We are actively working to mitigate the COVID related risks that we talked about today and finish this year strong with robust sales growth, and other strong EPS performance, and solid free cash flow. Our initial 2022 outlook as we've said, is expected to continue to deliver growth and strong operating performance again next year and we look forward to providing you some details around that guidance in our January call, so, we wish you all well, and thanks again for joining our call today.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-07-29 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to Northrop Grumman's second quarter 2021 conference call. Today's call is being recorded. My name is Nicole and I will be your operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Todd Ernst, Treasurer and Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Ernst, please proceed.
Todd Ernst: Thanks Nicole. Good morning everyone and welcome to Northrop Grumman's second quarter 2021 conference call. We will refer to a PowerPoint presentation that is posted on our IR web page this morning. Before we start, matters discussed on today's call, including 2021 guidance and beyond reflect the company's judgment based on information available at time of this call. They constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to safe harbor provisions of federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which are noted in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties may cause actual company results to differ materially. Today's call will include non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to our GAAP results in our earnings release. On today's call are Kathy Warden, our Chairman, CEO and President and Dave Keffer, our CFO. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Kathy. Kathy?
Kathy Warden: Thank you, Todd. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. Today, we are very pleased to announce another strong quarter. I will begin by recognizing our Northrop Grumman employees for their continued focus on operational excellence. Our results represents the successful execution of our strategy, the strength of our portfolio and the commitment of our team to deliver for our customers and shareholders. As the global environment continues to rapidly evolve and other nations gain more complex and sophisticated capabilities, our customers need innovative and affordable solution to be delivered with increasing speed and agility. With the investments we have made in advanced technologies combined with our talented workforce and adoption of digital transformation capabilities, Northrop Grumman is well-positioned to meet our customers' need and continue to strengthen our position for the future. This quarter, we once again delivered strong growth and operating performance. Our sales increased by 3% to $9.2 billion. Adjusting for the effects of our first quarter divestiture of the IT services business, organic sales increased 10%. While we do expect this growth rate to moderate in the second half of the year, we continue to have a robust pipeline of opportunities in 2021 and beyond. Additionally, program execution across the portfolio was exceptional which drove our segment operating margin to exceed 12%. This follows on strong Q1 performance, resulting in a year-to-date segment operating margin of 12.1%. And we continue to expect solid performance for the remainder of the year. Earnings per share increased 7% this quarter and transaction adjusted EPS has increased 16% year-to-date. Transaction adjusted free cash flow has also trended favorably and has increased 26% year-to-date. As a result, we ended the quarter with just under $4 billion in cash on the balance sheet. This provides us continued flexibility for capital deployment. We completed the $2 billion accelerated share repurchase in Q2 and continue to expect to repurchase over $3 billion for the year. Additionally, we increased our dividend by 8% in May. We are executing a balanced capital deployment strategy, which includes investing in the solutions our customers need and also returning cash to investors. Over the next couple of years, we continue to expect to return the majority of our free cash flow to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. In terms of budget updates from Washington, the Biden administration issued its budget request for fiscal year 2022 in May and it reinforces the administration's statements around investing in capabilities to maintain U.S. national security advantages. The request aligns well with the investments we have made at Northrop Grumman as we position our portfolio for the future. And while it's still relatively early in the budget process, we are pleased to see strong support for national security from the Congress, including $25 billion increase to the President's budget request approved last week by the Senate Armed Services Committee. Both the House Appropriations Committee and SASC have voiced strong support for many of our programs, including B-21, GBSD, Triton and F-35, to name a few. We look forward to working with the Congress and the administration as they make progress on the fiscal year 2022 budget. NASA was also well supported in the budget with a 7% year-over-year increase in proposed funding. NASA priorities include returning to the moon via the Artemis program where we are a key supplier of critical technologies, including the Habitat and Logistics Outpost or HALO and the solid rocket boosters for the Space Launch System, also known as SLS. This provides meaningful opportunity for the company and it demonstrates the diverse nature of our space business. Turning to business highlights from the quarter, I will share a few examples that help to demonstrate the strength of our portfolio and our technology leadership across key markets. In partnership with the Air Force, the B-21 program remains on track with two test aircraft in production today and we continue to make solid progress towards first flight. This program leverages the confluence of Northrop Grumman's long history in aircraft development and advanced low observability capabilities. The Air Force recently published an artist rendering and a B-21 fact sheet that provides additional insights into the program. The fact sheet highlights that the B-21 is being designed with open systems architecture to reduce integration risk and enable future modernization efforts to allow for the aircraft to evolve as the threat environment changes. As we have discussed on many of these calls, Northrop Grumman is a leader in communications and networking solutions, providing the connective tissue for military platform, sensors and systems that weren't designed to communicate with one another. Passing information and data using secure open systems, similar to how we use the Internet and 5G in our day-to-day lives. Our system played an important role in the Northern Edge 2021 joint exercise which was held in May and showcased how we enabled warfighters to easily communicate and securely share actionable information regardless of platform. As part of the exercise, Northrop Grumman systems were validated on three separate platforms. Our Freedom Pod was the part of a demonstration with the Air National Guard and our Freedom Radios were a key part of two demonstrations centered on advanced 5th-generation communication. And as a reminder, the Freedom Radios equip both the F-35 and F-22. We are also enabling Joint All Domain Command and Control for our Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System or IBCS. In July, the U.S. Army successfully engaged a cruise missile target in a highly contested electronic attack environment during the developmental flight test using Northrop Grumman's IBCS. This latest flight test integrated the widest variety of sensors to-date, including a Marine Corps G/ATOR Radar, which is our candidate's expeditionary radar that entered full rate production last year as well as F-35 and other ground sensors and interceptors. This would be eighth successful flight test performed for the IBCS program and the program is on track for a competitive downselect a full rate production later this year. In addition, we are making great progress on the GBSD program. In the second quarter, the team officially closed out the EMD baseline review with our Air Force customer and we completed the Integrated Baseline Review. The IVR is a critical step in setting cost and schedule baselines and is an important milestone for the program. And earlier this month, we were awarded a contract to continue our support of the Minuteman III Ground Subsystems until their successful transition to the GBSD system. So taking a step back, the examples that I provided highlight our strong performance, technology leadership and broad portfolio and its tight connection to national security priorities from modernizing our strategic deterrent to breakthrough technologies that connect our forces. Based on the strong results and performance of our company year-to-date and our latest outlook for the remainder of the year, we are increasing our 2021 revenue segment OM rate and transaction adjusted EPS guidance. Additionally, after two years of book-to-bill over 1.3, we expect our book-to-bill for the full year to be close to one this year with fee booking opportunities in the second half of the year that includes HALO, SLS, F-35 and several restricted programs laying the foundation for continued growth. Before I turn the call over to Dave, I would like to talk about ESG. We are very proud of our ESG record and the high marks we received in many environmental and in social rankings. We have built an organization with a robust governance structure, diverse and inclusive working environment and an ongoing and evolving focus on responsible environment stewardship. In May, we published our most recent sustainability report. It provides transparency into the progress and actions we have taken in these areas and more. To help ensure we adhere to these priorities every day, key components of our ESG goals are reflected in non-financial metrics that are incorporated into the leadership team annual incentive compensation. And just last week, we announced the appointment of a Chief Sustainability Officer who will report to me and drive further enhancements to our ESG program. I want to again thank all of our employees for stepping up to the challenge our nation is facing and for remaining focused on delivering for our customers and our shareholders. Our second quarter results and enhanced 2021 outlook demonstrate that our strong fundamental trends continue. Over the long term, we are well-positioned to provide our customers innovative and affordable solutions to help address national security threat while driving profitable growth and value creation for our shareholders. So with that, I will turn the call over to Dave who will provide more detail on our sector results and our updated 2021 guidance. Dave?
Dave Keffer: Thanks Kathy and good morning everyone. My comments begin with second quarter highlights on slide three. We delivered another quarter of excellent organic sales growth and outstanding segment operating margin rate and higher EPS. Our year-to-date transaction adjusted free cash flow increased 26% and we continued to returning cash to shareholders through our buyback program and our quarterly dividend which we increased by 8% in Q2. As a result of our outstanding first half performance and enhanced outlook for the year, we are pleased to be raising our sales, segment operating margin rate and EPS guidance. Slide four provides a bridge between second quarter 2020 and second quarter 2021 sales. Normalizing for the IT services divestiture, which was a $585 million headwind in the second quarter of 2021, our organic sales increased 10% compared to last year. Working days were the same in both periods. Moving to slide five which compares our earnings per share between Q2 2020 and Q2 2021. Our EPS increased 7% to $6.42. Operational performance contributed $0.60 of growth and lower unallocated corporate costs driven by state tax changes added another $0.22. Our marketable securities performance was a modest earnings benefit in Q2 but compared to the even more favorable equity markets experienced in the same quarter last year, it represented a year-over-year headwind of $0.18. Lastly, we experienced a higher federal tax rate in the period due to a change in tax revenue recognition on certain contracts for years prior to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Next, I will begin a review of sector results on slide six. Aeronautics sales were roughly flat for the quarter and up 2% year-to-date. Sales in both periods were higher in manned aircraft, principally due to higher volume on restricted programs and E-2D, partially offset by lower production activity on A350 and lower volume in autonomous systems. At defense systems, sales decreased by 24% in the quarter and 21% year-to-date. And on an organic basis, sales were down roughly 3% in both periods. Lower organic sales were driven by the completion of our Lake City activities, which represented a headwind of $120 million in the quarter and $260 million year-to-date. This was partially offset by higher volume in both periods on GMLRS as well as ramp up on the Global Hawk Contractor Logistics Support program for the Republic of Korea. Mission systems sales were up 6% in the second quarter and 8% year-to-date. On an organic basis, MS delivered another double digit sales increase in the quarter of almost 12%. And organic sales were higher in all four of its business units in both periods. Turning to space systems. Sales continued to grow at a robust rate rising 34% in the second quarter and 32% year-to-date. Sales in both business areas were higher in the quarter and year-to-date periods reflecting continued ramp-up on GBSD and NGI, as well as higher volume on restricted programs, Artemis and Next Generation OPIR. Moving to segment operating income and margin rate on slide seven. We had an outstanding operational quarter with segment margin rate at 12.2%. Aeronautics Q2 operating income decreased 3% due to benefit of $21 million recognized in the second quarter of 2020 from the resolution of a government accounting matter. Operating margin rate was consistent at 10.3% in Q2 and the year-to-date period. At defense systems, operating income decreased by 18% in the quarter and 15% year-to-date, primarily due to the impact of the IT services divestiture. Operating margin rate increased to 12.4% in the quarter and 11.8% year-to-date. The increase in operating margin rate was largely driven by improved business performance and business mix in battle management and missile systems programs. Operating income at mission systems rose 18% in the quarter and 15% year-to-date due to higher sales volume and improved performance. Operating margin rate increased to 15.8% in the quarter and benefited from the favorable resolution of certain cost accounting matters as well as changes in business mix as a result of the IT services divestiture. Year-to-date, operating margin rate increased to 15.5%. Space systems operating income rose 44% in the quarter and 40% year-to-date and operating margin rate was 11% in both periods. Higher operating income is primarily a result of the higher sales volume along with the timing of risk retirements contributing to higher net favorable earnings adjustments in both periods. Now turning to sector guidance on slide eight. You will note that we are now providing quantified ranges for sales and OM rates instead of the broader descriptions such as low to mid or mid to high, given the improved visibility that we have as we pass the midpoint of this fiscal year. We are increasing the sales outlooks of our defense, mission systems and space sectors, given the strong volume that each produced in the first half and solid outlooks for second half performance. We are slightly reducing sales guidance for aeronautics, reflecting the continued plateauing of several of our production programs after years of outsized growth. For operating margin rate, we are increasing our guidance at defense, MS and space and the margin rate at AS remains unchanged. Moving to consolidated guidance on slide nine. We are raising our 2021 outlook for several key metrics. For sales, we are increasing the midpoint of our guide by $500 million to a range of $35.8 billion to $36.2 billion. This translates to full year organic growth of over 4% and over 5% excluding the 2020 equipment sale at AS. As you review our sales trends, keep in mind that the first half benefited from one month of the IT services business and had seven more working days than the second half will have. We expect the company to have higher organic sales per working day in the second half of the year than the first. We are also increasing both our segment operating margin rate and our overall operating margin rate ranges by 10 basis points to 11.6% to 11.8% and 15.5% to 15.7%, respectively. Keep in mind that the gain from the IT services divestiture contributed approximately five points of our overall operating margin benefit. We are proud of our profit performance in the first half and continue to expect strong results in the second half of the year. First half net favorable EAC adjustments were particularly strong with lower rates driving Q1 outperformance and program risk retirements contributing to Q2 strength. For unallocated corporate expense, our updated guidance reflects a $30 million reduction associated with state tax changes. And we now foresee an effective federal tax rate in the high 17% range, excluding effects of the divestiture, which is an increase from our prior guidance. We project a federal tax rate of approximately 22.5% on a GAAP basis. Finally, we are raising our EPS guidance which I will highlights on slide 11. The increase in guidance is driven by $0.40 of segment operational improvement. Lower unallocated corporate costs almost fully offset the headwind from the higher federal tax rate leading to an increase in our transaction adjusted EPS guidance of $0.35 at the midpoint. Next, I would like to take a moment to talk about cash. Since our in January, we have raised the midpoint of our sales guide by $700 million. With those additional sales come additional working capital needs to fuel the growth. But in light of our outstanding first half cash flow performance, we project that we can absorb that additional working capital in our existing transaction adjusted free cash flow guidance of $3 billion to $3.3 billion. We believe this range reflects continued strength in cash conversion balanced with prudent investments in key growth segments of our market. I also wanted to provide more information on the projected impact on our 2022 CAS pension recoveries from the American Rescue Plan Act, which was passed this spring. While asset returns and actuarial assumptions will continue to influence the final number, our current estimate is approximately $185 million of CAS recoveries in 2022, down $55 million from our January guide and down about $300 million from our expected 2021 level. We continue to expect minimal required pension contributions over the next several years. Regarding cash deployment, as Kathy mentioned, we completed our $2 billion accelerated share repurchase in the second quarter retiring over six million shares at an average price of around $327 per share. And we continue to target over $3 billion of total buybacks in 2021. At the end of the second quarter, we had approximately $3.7 billion of remaining share repurchase authorization. In conclusion, we are very pleased to have delivered another quarter of rapid growth, outstanding program performance, strong cash flow and accretive cash deployment. And with that, Todd, I think we are ready to open up the call for Q&A.
Todd Ernst: And Nicole, remind everyone how to get in the queue.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. The first question will come from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein.
Doug Harned: Good morning.
Kathy Warden: Good morning Doug.
Doug Harned: Space is now such a big area for you, I wondered if you could give us a sense of how you look at this sort of a broader environment because we are seeing many new entrants in space, commercial players, some doing small sats, launch vehicles, other things. So when you look at that this evolution for Northrop Grumman, where do these players present competition for you? Where can they present partnership opportunities? How do you see this world evolving?
Kathy Warden: Thanks for the question, Doug. It's because if we look at our portfolio, as I said before it's is quite broad both in terms of the technologies that we offer, the integration capability that we provide. And so, in each segment of the market, we follow a strategy of both partnering and meeting and combining partner capabilities into our own team. In national security space, for example, we are operating as both a strategic partner to many other primes while also being able to lead efforts on our own that integrate our technologies into others. In the case of civil space, in particular NASA with space exploration, the same is true. Our HALO program is an example of where we were leading. We were awarded that full force, but we do have partners on that program that are bringing differentiating technologies. While at the same time, on Human Lander, we chose to partner, in that case, with Blue Origin. So, in each case, we look at the capabilities that our team has to bring to the overall mission requirements and whether it's best for us to lead or follow. In order to do that, we need to have strong partnerships, both with the more traditional space companies in our industry as well as some of the new entrants like SpaceX and Blue that are of a larger scale. And I also don't want any of us to forget that there are a number of smaller companies that also have been very good partners for us in this area and will continue to be in the future and there are dozens of them. We tend not to go forward with singular and focused partnerships in one particular company. But instead have a wide variety of partners that we work with in this area and that's what we plan to continue to do as the space evolves.
Doug Harned: Well, when you look at this and one area is small sats, for example, where I think a lot of aspects of the people now look at it as becoming more commoditized and there's a number of small players. Raytheon made the decision to acquire Blue Canyon. How do you look at the part of the universe here in terms of what you see as a differentiated capability at Northrop Grumman that clearly your position is going to be very strong for a long time and then perhaps some other areas and small sat bus could be one where you could own it or not own it? How do you think of the divisions between those two?
Kathy Warden: Well, as I was noting, we believe that we should own what is most important to fully integrated offering that meets mission requirements and we particularly are focused, in our case, on national security space and space exploration. And so we don't feel we need to own everything. Our acquisition of Orbital ATK rounded out our portfolio nicely. We now have both bus offerings as well as the ability to develop satellites on small scale rapidly as well as more exquisite payloads for more sophisticated missions. And we like that breadth of our portfolio as it exists today. That's not to say we have everything we need, which is where partnering comes in. But we don't feel we need to take an equity quarter or acquire companies to get access to those capabilities.
Doug Harned: Okay. Very good. Thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America.
Ron Epstein: Hi. Good morning. Kathy, I was just wondering of maybe two things. Could you remind us what's on the horizon in terms of competitions latter half of this year into next year? And then the second point, in terms of capital deployment itself, is there any areas that you are looking or how you are think about that?
Kathy Warden: Thanks Ron. So I will start with the competitions that we have seen in the latter half of this year. Most of our second half awards are actually noncompetitive. We are looking at F-35 SLS awards in the latter half of the year. There are several restricted programs, which are competitive that we are looking to book in the second half and we also have IBCS which I mentioned earlier on the call, which will be selected for full rate production in the second half of this year. As we look longer term, there are aircraft development programs in the pipeline, but those are a bit further out. And so those are areas, to the second part of your question, that we are investing to position for that are not necessarily evident in our short range plan. The other areas that we are investing in, when I became CEO in 2019 we defined mission campaigns and I have talked about several of them in the past. They include areas like national security space, strategic missiles where we have made significant progress in the last couple of years executing those campaign strategies, booking new awards and moving our position in those market segments materially. We continue with that focus. And so looking forward, major areas include future manned aircraft and unmanned aircraft. We also see continued growth in our advanced weapons portfolio and our advanced networking and communications portfolio, just to name a few.
Ron Epstein: Great. Thank you. Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question will come from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Good morning. Kathy, Dave and Todd. So going back to space, Kathy, a hot topic right now, 37% growth in the quarter, very good. How do we kind of think about this business over the medium term? Does it continue at double digits outside of GBSD growth? Maybe if you could talk about that given the deceleration you have in for the second half with high single digit? And just the margin contraction, is that related to some of the new programs that you are starting in space?
Kathy Warden: Yes. Sheila, why don't I start and then I am going to Dave to walk through a few of the specific structural items. There is no doubt that our space business is performing exceptionally. There are some structural items to consider when you look at the first half compared to the second half. We walked through a few of those, working days, the timing of our pension cost reductions that flow through our program EACs and the impact on margin and then timing of particular programs like GBSD, which started to ramp in the second half of last year and therefore create a tougher compare in the second half of this. But with that said, this business has exceeded our expectations, frankly, since it was set up 19 month ago. And we aren't betting against it in the second half. But generally, we don't forecast that kind of success that the business is having. But we certainly strive to deliver it. And that's what the team has been doing all year to this point. So I am going to turn it over to Dave because he can walk you through some of those structural items that I mentioned, as you model the second half compared to the first. But I want to leave you with the impression that we still have significant opportunity in the pipeline for this business, I talked about the second half awards and great momentum that will enable this business to continue to grow.
Dave Keffer: Thanks Kathy. That's a great summary. The first half of the year was just an outstanding half for space and we continue to see a strong second half in store. You mentioned the working day impact on organic growth in the first quarter. As we noted, that was three extra working days for a 5% or so benefit to growth in Q4. It's four fewer working days for a 6% to 7% headwind for growth. But of course, those are just timing items. More broadly speaking, we had the GBSD and NGI programs ramping up in the first half and that will continue going forward. In the second quarter, we noted that we had really strong program performance in particular on some commercial programs where we had net EAC benefits in the quarter that contributed to that really strong margin rate performance you saw from space in the first half in addition to the first quarter indirect rate improvements that we talked about on our April call. So in aggregate, a really strong first half for the business. In the second half, we expect continued strong performance. We had originally guided this business to be about a 10% margin rate business for this year. We are outperforming that number of this year. We continue to see that as a reasonable expectation in that 10% margin rate range after this year. And so, it's a really strong business in a great part of the market and we intend to continue gaining share there.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.
Seth Seifman: Thanks very much and good morning everyone. Kathy, you mentioned HALO has an award coming up for, I think, you probably it seems like you have it in the third quarter. And I noticed there was a firm-fixed-price contract, I guess and for something in space where we all know how much risk there can be involved in space programs. How do you think about taking on a firm-fixed-price contract for an important space opportunity? And what does it say about the way that you and your customers are looking at risk in the space area more broadly?
Kathy Warden: Thanks. The Halo program is a firm-fixed-price contract. We don't see it as a development effort for say, it's building off of the habitat that we have built in the past and so a lot of commonality with prior efforts and strong experience in this area. And that goes to how we think about bidding more generally. You know that we have a track record of not bidding when we assess the risk as too great to be able to mitigate prior to putting in a fixed-price proposal. And we have walked away in the past from opportunities as a result of finding ourselves in that situation. We are getting more sophisticated in being able to shape these opportunities and do risk reduction prior to the bid so that we can get comfortable that those risks are well understood and that we have a plan to mitigate them. And that indeed is the case with HALO. With that said, we have very little fixed-price development work in our portfolio. And so as we look across the portfolio and think about that risk exposure, I think part of your question is going to, are we doing more of that. And the reality is that we are not doing more fixed-price development work today than we have in the past and we don't see that as a broad trend in the industry.
Seth Seifman: Great. Thanks very much.
Operator: The next question will come from the line of Richard Safran with Seaport Global.
Richard Safran: Kathy, Dave and Todd, good morning. How are you?
Kathy Warden: Good morning.
Richard Safran: Either Kathy or David, with a number of programs advancing from development to production, I thought now might be a good time to ask how you are managing cost and cost takeout, both internally and with the supply chain? So I am just wondering how you are incentivizing and challenging the business segments and suppliers to takeout cost and drive productivity improvements? I know it's a general question but any insight into how you think about this would be helpful as we just consider how to Northrop for longer term?
Kathy Warden: Thanks Rich. It is an important question at this point in time as we do see a transition to more production work. We continue to focus on cost control across the company and it is aided now by our digital transformation efforts. It is an enterprisewide effort led out of my office and we are streamlining and automating processes both for our product development, so taking cost out of the product development cycle and manufacturing as well as the back office, both of which contribute to margin improvement opportunity. And those will evolve over the next several years as we implement different phases of that digital transformation. We are also monitoring labor cost, something you didn't ask specifically about. But we have not yet seen significant pressure upward on labor costs but we are tracking it because as you all know, nationwide attrition and movement is upward trending. And we have not seen that in our company. Our attrition is fairly similar to what it was pre-COVID. But we do continue to monitor that and expect to be able to fully offset that with the efficiencies I referenced in our digital transformation into that part of what we are thinking about as we are setting those goals. With regard to supplier pricing, we have seen some modest pressure in supplier pricing. It's mostly related to areas where there are supply bottlenecks. Think semi conductors, certain commodities. But we expect those to be transitory and to be more than offset by the internal efficiencies I spoke about. And in Dave's team where we manage our enterprise supplier work, is they are doing some really good things to get ahead contractually and through supplier management of those pressures. So Dave, why don't I turn it to you for any additional comments you would like to make.
Dave Keffer: Sure. Thanks Kathy. We have a keen focus on the supply chain these days, certainly where we are looking at COVID-driven pressures over the past year and felt those were mitigated well. We are continuing to track that, of course on the inflationary side. I think those pressures have been modest so far and focused on a few particular commodities but have not been anything we haven't been able to mitigate. Kathy mentioned contract structures do reduce that risk. About half of our work is cost type work and of the remainder, the majority is priced over short durations and so we get to reprice those frequently enough to mitigate that pressure. On the semiconductor side, we have seen in certain areas and pockets, I would say, we have seen extended lead times but nothing we haven't been able to mitigate broadly by partnering with our suppliers, by sharing demand signals well in advance and being in tight communication with those in the challenging pockets of that semiconductor community. We are also continuing to make use of our own foundry where appropriate and where in the best interest of our customers. So taking a step back and kind of summarizing, certainly the [indiscernible] is critical to our cost management efforts and to our execution efforts in general and more broadly speaking cost management is a keen focus of ours everyday. We don't talk about it a lot on these calls but certainly it's something that is part and parcel of everything we do, our IT costs, our real estate costs. As Kathy mentioned, we are careful about labor and semiconductor costs and other key elements of our supply chain as well. So these are areas that we are keenly focused on. Certainly, digital transformation is the next key initiative that will have a significant beneficial impact. But broadly speaking, it's something that's high on our radar.
Richard Safran: That was really great color. Thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.
Cai von Rumohr: Yes. Thank you. Excellent results again. Space margins, I think we have always talked about, is the mix becoming more production, is it more development and obviously, with all the wins you had in space, GBSD, NGI, it looks like the mix is becoming more development. So I am a little surprised by the very strong margin that you delivered in space. I mean it looks like in the second half you are looking at about 10% or a little bit under. But maybe talk to us, is that by your sectors, mainly space, mission and aeronautics, is the net shift in the mix toward production or toward development or is it essentially balanced going forward?
Dave Keffer: So I can start on that, Cai. It's a good question. On the space side, we have touched on some of this But certainly, to your point, we have been really pleased to be able to increase the margin rate guide there from 10% at the start of the year to 110.2% to 10.4% in our latest guidance. That's driven by the strength of our first half performance across programs in that portfolio. I mentioned it on the commercial side of the portfolio. There was particular strength in Q2. The indirect rate reductions in the first quarter were also beneficial there. And the second half margin rate continues to look solid. And longer term, we continue to think of it as about a 10% business though there that mix pressure that you describe. And so that 10% margin is in the face of that pressure and really driven by the strength of operating performance that we continue to see in the business to include direct and indirect cost performance as well as program execution milestones. And so it's certainly been a favorable story as we have seen the cost type development work begin to grow in space and one that we expect to continue. MS and AS have a bit of a different picture moving forward that is, to some degree, offset the cost type increase in space, MS, in particular, has had a mix shift toward a more fixed price this year, partially driven by the divestiture, which removed a portion of it's cost type portfolio. And in AS, the broader long term trend would shift a bit more towards fixed price as well. So again, this is one of those scenarios where it's helpful to have broad portfolio with different types of businesses at different phases of their lifecycles and that's what we see unfolding in the coming years.
Cai von Rumohr: Great answer. Thanks so much.
Operator: The next question will come from the line of Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley.
Kristine Liwag: Hi. Good morning, everyone.
Kathy Warden: Good morning.
Kristine Liwag: Kathy, circling back on the Artemis Lunar Lander program, Blue Origin has proposed to NASA to waive $2 billion of fees. How does this affect your partnership with Blue Origin? And what's your appetite to support a loss leader approach in space?
Kathy Warden: Thanks Kristine. So let's get back to the question Doug was asking as well, when we think about partnership and clearly when we lead an effort, we will choose to make sizable investment to protect that program and increase our probability of win over it's life because of the advantage that you have got when you are the leader, the prime only effort. And that's exactly what Blue Origin is doing. And it's important to also note that the business case for Blue extends well beyond the NASA program as they think about their aspirations for commercial space travel. In the case of Northrop Grumman, we have to do that similar business case assessment and we have come to different answers in terms of what our contribution should be to the overall program financials and that's expected. In any good partnership that you lay out, the clear expectations of each party, but also the benefits to be gained by each party and aligning of expectations for financial investment.
Kristine Liwag: Thanks Kathy. And maybe switching gears to your nuclear business. We saw the nuclear enterprise get solid support in the fiscal year 2022 budget. But now the new administration is undertaking its own nuclear posture review and it sounds like it's going to be integrated with their new national defense strategy as well. With your exposure with the two legs of a nuclear triad with B-21 and GBSD,, what are you watching for when you get a document like this?. And do you anticipate to see any major changes?
Kathy Warden: Well, first, I am very pleased that the administration is looking at the national defense strategy and the nuclear posture review in an integrated way because it is the threat environment that should define the overall defense strategy and the role of the strategic deterrence of a nuclear program as part of that strategy. So it's an indication to me that that's exactly how the administration is thinking about it. They have been clear that their assessment of the threat, particularly with Russia being the pacing threat with regard to nuclear and China being an emerging but very rapidly growing threat and recent intelligence just further supports that, that with that basis, they will look at what each administration before them has done, our overall nuclear posture review and ensure that the programs and the modernization plans indeed measure up against that threat. We are very confident that once again the threat assessments, the affordability of these programs and the requirements being met by these program will line up well to both the NDS and the NPR and that should play out over the next six months or so.
Kristine Liwag: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question will come from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse.
Robert Spingarn: Hi Good morning.
Kathy Warden: Good morning.
Robert Spingarn: Hi. Dave, I have got one for you on just cash flow cadence and just the smoother cash flow we saw this year. I think last quarter, you talked about some of the working capital improvements that drove a smaller outflow there. So now with the first half in the books, how does the second half shakeout Q3 to Q4 in terms of free cash flow? Is it going to be flat? Or do we have a bigger Q4 that we typically see? And if it is flatter, is that something you can hold on to long term?
Dave Keffer: Sure. Thanks for the question, Rob. We don't give quarterly guidance but we did talk about the general trends. And I think you should expect our second half trends this year to be similar to prior years. We had a smoother first half than usual, as you mentioned. We are pleased with that and that's something we will strive for going forward. As we look at the second half, overall, as I mentioned, we are driving for the $3 billion to $3.3 billion free cash flow target that we have had since we started the year. As we mentioned at the beginning of the year, as you alluded to, that required some working capital enhancements given the growth that we were seeing and in order to offset the lower pension reimbursements the outflows associated with payroll tax deferral this year and a couple hundred million dollars of divestiture-related free cash flow that we had been generating each year prior. And so in aggregate, it required substantial working capital improvements. We have now delivered on those in the first half of the year and are really pleased with the progress through the first half. Without giving a quarterly outlook for the second half, we expect continued strength in the third and fourth quarters. That leads to a strong $3 billion to $3.3 billion as we mentioned in our guidance for the year. I would also note, I think of that as a pure free cash flow number than we have had in prior years, given the CAS pension dynamics which, as we noted on the call, will continue into next year. So that purification of the cash flow, the strength in working capital, I think, are good news stories as it relates to fee cash.
Robert Spingarn: Thanks Dave.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Research.
Robert Stallard: Thanks so much. Good morning.
Kathy Warden: Good morning.
Robert Stallard: Dave, this one for you. Can you elaborate on what the programs are in aerospace that are going to be plateauing out going forward from here?
Dave Keffer: Sure. I will be happy to start on that one, Rob. We would noted if there were one or two programs driving that. It's really broader based than that. We have been talking about the trends and the lifecycles of various AS programs on the unrestricted side over the last couple of years. And our comments there will be consistent with that. On the F-35 program, we have noted in the past that we deliver ahead of the primes timeline. And so in this case, we would expect to plateau ahead of our prime on that. And so that's among the programs we would note here. On the unmanned side, in the HALO portfolio, we touched about the budget dynamics associated there. And so there is some ongoing budget decision-making to occur for both Global Hawk and Triton. But certainly I would include those in the plateauing list. I would include F-18 as well. And so broadly speaking, it's not any one program but a series of them. On the commercial side of our aerostructures business, there has been pressure really over the last year since the COVID dynamics occurred. And so there is long term growth opportunity there as the commercial market recovers a bit in the near term. That smaller portion of our portfolio has faced some pressure as well.
Robert Stallard: Okay. That's very helpful. And Kathy, maybe one for you. You mentioned JADC2 in your commentary. It seems to be the buzzword in the DoD these days. I was wondering how you think this program is going to evolve? Are we going to see one mega program or lots of smaller efforts contributing to this theme? And what could be the opportunities for Northrop Grumman?
Kathy Warden: So I absolutely see this being a collection of smaller efforts rather than one large program. And that supports the ability for the government to make this architecture a reality. Digesting it by upgrading platforms and sensors with the ability to communicate with one another, share data and be part of an architecture is a much better solution, in my view, then trying to go with a single party or a single platform to be the network of choice because the mission requirements vary so greatly. When you think about a contested space and the kind of architecture that you need, it's very different than when you are operating in an uncontested environment like we have been over the last 20 years in the Middle East. So there will be many architectures to be able to support different theaters and mission requirements in JADC2 and therefore an opportunity for all of industry to participate. Where Northrop Grumman is particularly strong is in our advanced networking as those capabilities are the core of helping platforms and systems that were not designed to share data to be able to do so in the future. And I would also note that's a much more affordable answer to getting a platform modernized to be part of a JADC2 architecture than completely redesigning or replacing the platform itself.
Robert Stallard: That make sense. Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question will come from the line of Myles Walton with UBS.
Myles Walton: Thanks. Good morning. Dave, back to the cash for a second. The working capital headwinds you observed, can you maybe just size that? And also a couple years of elevated growth and likely some moderation in the growth next year, should we expect the working capital to start to flow out in 2022 and 2023 in a more measurable sense?
Dave Keffer: Yes. Thanks for the question, Myles. It's tough to size exactly the nature of the pressure from the increased growth this year. As we mentioned, we have increased our guidance now by $700 million in sales since the beginning of the year. And so you can apply a reasonable days of working capital metrics there and it's $100 million or so of pressure on that metric that we are able to overcome, in part due to strong first half performance and the strength and outlook that that gives us as a result. As we look at 2022 and beyond, we are certainly not finished in our efforts to drive working capital efficiency and effectiveness. Like what we talked about earlier with cost management, that's something we wake up every day and focus on. And that the focus will continue. So I will look for continued opportunities in 2022 and 2023. More broadly, as we think about free cash in 2022 and beyond, we had the pension dynamics I mentioned earlier that we will need to overcome. And then on the tax side, everyone is awaiting news on legislative environment there as it relates to the R&D amortization issues and such. So we are focused, as you would imagine, on the things we can control which are around working capital efficiency, being prudent with our capital expenditures, focusing those on key growth areas of the market. And at this point, we feel confident that we are doing a good job in both of those areas.
Myles Walton: All right. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of David Strauss with Barclays.
David Strauss: Thanks. Good morning everyone.
Kathy Warden: Hi David.
David Strauss: Back on the space, Kathy. So it looks like with your revised revenue guidance, you are talking about $2 billion revenue increase year-over-year adjusting for the divested revenues as well. I think previously you had said GBSD was $800 million to $900 million. Does that still hold within that? Or has that improved? And then if you could just break out the big chunks that are driving that extra $1 billion or so revenue growth this year?
Kathy Warden: Yes. So GBSD is still close to $1 billion of incremental revenue this year as we anticipated and about 60% of the growth is non-GBSD in the midpoint of our guide as we project out for the remainder of the year. So healthy growth across the entirety of the portfolio, not just GBSD. And I will note and I have spoken about this before, GBSD will continue to grow into next year and 2023. So it has a long ramp, if you will. But it's just amazing to hear you repeat it, $2 billion of growth in that segment is just tremendous. The team is executing and winning work at a rate that I haven't seen in my time in the industry. So kudos to them.
David Strauss: And Kathy, that non-GBSD portion, I think you said 60%, does that bucket grow next year as well?
Kathy Warden: We expect it to. Again, we will provide more color on our 2022 guidance. But we expect space to continue to be our fastest-growing segment. It will modulate from this year certainly. There just aren't the same number of opportunities going into 2022 that there are in 2021. We still have confidence in the team's ability to win. But we do see that modulating a bit. But still plenty of growth drivers for 2022.
David Strauss: Terrific. Thanks very much for the color.
Kathy Warden: Thank you.
Todd Ernst: We have time for one more question.
Operator: The final question will come from the line of Mike Maugeri with Wolfe Research
Mike Maugeri: Hi. Good morning. Thank you. Kathy, I would be curious to hear your thoughts on cyber domain. Maybe just how you see that trending relative to the budget at a high-level? Where do you see Northrop in the landscape? How big is it for you? And then how it trends for Northrop relative to the rest of Northrop?
Kathy Warden: So cyber continues to be an important standalone market segment. When we think about the work we are doing for customer to enable secure processing, secure communication, oftentimes those programs are wrapped up under those umbrellas when we talked about a processing program or a communications program. In addition, now the ability to securely command and control or communicate is a differentiator in many of the programs that we are bidding and winning. It was true on GBSD. Secure command and control was an essential requirement and we were able to bring forward a solution to that requirement based on the strength of our cyber expertise that we gained largely from our direct work with the governments on securing their assets that then apply internally as we build new weapon system. So, a lot of synergy with our standalone cyber portfolio even though it, in of itself, is not that large. It does drive opportunity and differentiation across the entirety of the business. And we see it continuing to grow. It has been running for a decade and we expect that trend to continue. It's just about every weapons now have requirements for secure.
Todd Ernst: Great. All right. We will it leave it there and turn over to Kathy for some closing remarks.
Kathy Warden: Thank you Todd. Well, again, this quarter, we demonstrated our ability to execute our strategy and deliver growth, operational excellence and balanced capital deployment. So our strong performance, all the credit goes to the team and I want to thank them again for their hard work and continued efforts. As we look forward, I have great confidence in our future. Thanks for joining us today. I look forward to our next call in October.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-04-29 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's First Quarter 2021 Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. My name is Mariama, and I will be your operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Todd Ernst, Treasurer and Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Ernst, please proceed.
Todd Ernst: Good morning, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's first quarter 2021 conference call. This morning, we will refer to a PowerPoint presentation that is posted on our IR web page. And before we start, I'd just like to remind you that matters discussed on today's call, including guidance and our outlook for 2021 and beyond reflect the company's judgment based on information available at the time of this call. They constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to safe harbor provisions of federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which are noted in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties may cause actual company results to differ materially. Matters discussed on today's call will include non-GAAP financial measures, which are defined and reconciled in our earnings release and supplemental PowerPoint presentation. On the call today are Kathy Warden, our Chairman, CEO and President; and Dave Keffer, our CFO. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kathy.  Kathy?
Kathy Warden: Thank you, Todd. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I want to congratulate the Northrop Grumman team for a very strong start to 2021. One year after the onset of the pandemic, we have adjusted to a new way of working and we continue to support our employees, our customers, our suppliers and our communities, which has enabled us to deliver outstanding results to our shareholders. Our results demonstrate the strength of our team, our portfolio, our strategy and our operating performance. Our solid bookings and competitive wins, robust organic sales growth and excellent operational performance resulted in strong margin rates, earnings and cash in the quarter. We also closed the divestiture of our IT services business, and successfully transitioned those employees and programs to Peraton. Elaborating on financial highlights. We booked new awards of $8.9 billion, grew sales 6% and increased segment operating income, 13%. GAAP EPS of $13.43 reflects the IT services gain and transaction-adjusted EPS increased 28% in the quarter. First quarter operating cash improved by more than $900 million year-over-year. Using cash on the balance sheet and divestiture proceeds, we executed a $2 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement that retired an initial 5.9 million shares. We also retired $2.2 billion in debt, including early redemptions of $1.5 billion. Even with share repurchases, dividends and deleveraging, all of which totaled more than $4.4 billion, we exceeded the first -- we ended the first quarter with $3.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet. As I outlined in January, this year's capital deployment plans continue to include robust investment to drive innovation and affordability and at least $1 billion of additional share repurchases. Based on what we see now over the next couple of years, we expect to return the majority of our free cash flow to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. With the strength of our first quarter results, a solid outlook for the remainder of the year and confidence in our portfolio, we are raising our sales and EPS guidance. We now expect sales will increase to between $35.3 billion and $35.7 billion, a $200 million increase to the prior range. And we are raising transaction-adjusted EPS guidance by $0.85 to a range of $24 to $24.50. As we look forward, we believe our capabilities will remain well aligned with U.S. national security priorities. In early policy guidance, such as its interim national security strategy, the Biden administration has signaled that it views competition with China as the most pressing long-term security challenge, and will invest in the capabilities needed to maintain U.S. national security advantages. In its recent budget framework for fiscal year 2022, the administration described several priority efforts that are closely aligned with our portfolio and technology leadership. These include space, modernizing the nuclear deterrent, advanced weapons and long-range fires capabilities and R&D for breakthrough technologies, such as artificial intelligence, advanced computing and cyber. Turning to operational highlights in the quarter. Our Space business doubled its backlog in 2020 and achieved 30% revenue growth in each of the last two quarters. This performance confirms our competitive capabilities and our ability to capture market share as our nation ramps up investment in Space. Three competitive awards in the first quarter are good examples: The hypersonic and ballistic tracking space sensor; the protected tactical SATCOM, rapid prototype program; and the next-generation interceptor. On HBTSS, we received $155 million award to build a prototype sensor satellite capability capable of tracking hypersonic weapons from space. For protected tactical SATCOM, we were down selected for a follow-on award to proceed with our ongoing prototype development with a flight demonstration of our PTS payload expected in 2024. We also were awarded a $2.6 billion contract for the next phase of the Missile Defense Agency's next-generation interceptor, known as NGI, with a period of performance through 2026. This contract is for the rapid development and flight test of an interceptor designed to defend against the most complex long-range threats. Opportunities for Northrop Grumman Space also extend to civil and commercial space. NASA's fiscal year 2022 discretionary requests is $24.7 billion, a 6.3% increase over the 2021 enacted level. Importantly, the request supports human exploration of the moon, Mars and beyond. Support for the NASA budget enables our efforts on space launch systems and Halo, the Habitation and Logistics Outpost program. And in commercial space, MEV1 continues to provide life extension services to an Intelsat satellite and have received via satellite technology of the year award. The award recognizes the technology breakthrough that reshapes the way the satellite industry works now and for years to come. I'm also pleased to report that earlier this month, MEV-2 successfully docked with another Intelsat satellite. MEV-2 will provide five years of service before undocking and moving on to provide services for a new mission. Northrop Grumman is a pioneer in this field and remains the only provider of flight-proven life extension services for satellites. As the U.S. continues modernizing its strategic deterrent capabilities, we are proud to be the prime contractor for two legs of the TRIAD: The B-21 bomber; and the ground-based strategic deterrent, or GBSD; as well as a key supplier on the third leg. These modernization programs, which were initiated in the Obama administration, are expected to begin filling at the end of this decade. Both GBSD and B-21 are benefiting from our use of innovative digital tools to reduce technical risk and cost. As the Air Force has noted, B-21 development has been unique in that the test aircraft are more mature than other systems have been at this point, allowing us to validate our production processes much sooner in the program life cycle. And our GBSD program successfully completed two major milestone reviews and remains on track to field an initial operating capability by 2029. We are working closely with the Air Force partner and industry teammates to use digital engineering and agile software development to reduce risk and shorten development time lines as we modernize this critical system. The GBSD program has earned the E-Series designation from the U.S. Air Force, affirming the program's cutting-edge approach to digital transformation. All four of our sectors are aligned to the high priority investment areas needed to maintain military superiority. In addition to developing new platforms and weapon systems, we are enabling the modernization of existing platforms to ensure our war fighters have the best technology that their platforms can be modularly upgraded to counter evolving threats. In the first quarter, we received orders totaling approximately $500 million for additional Sabre radar systems for the F-16. With these additional orders, we're now under contract to produce approximately 900 systems in the support of F-16 upgrades and new jet procurements for 8 FMS countries, as well as upgrades to our U.S. Air Force, Guard and Reserve F-16 fleets. Also on the F-16 for the U.S. Air Force, we were down selected as the sole offer for the EMD in production of a modern electronic warfare fleet to provide next-generation threat protection and ensure an upgrade path for advanced capabilities against highly agile future threats. And during the quarter, the U.S. Army approved our Kirkham system, for full rate production following a successful six month initial operational test and evaluation on its helicopters. We also continue to demonstrate how we can connect platforms and sensors to enable joint all domain command and control or JADC2. Our fifth generation connectivity solutions will be featured on multiple platforms in the upcoming Northern Edge 21 Exercise in May. We expect to participate in several other exercises over the next 12 months, including the Army's project Convergence, where IBCS is expected to be featured. And we're responding to the ABMS digital infrastructure investment priority, requiring secure processing, connectivity and data management. And finally, we are maturing our advanced weaponry and long-range fires capabilities. We conducted a successful live fire demonstration of our integrated counter UAS solutions this quarter. The demonstration showcased our next-generation proximity ammunition and its capability to defeat Class 1, 2 and 3 unmanned aerial systems. In addition, AARGM-ER had two successful static motor tests of a rocket motor, marketing nine consecutive successful tests in preparation for the upcoming flight tests. All of these successes reflects the quality of our team and the benefits of our recent investment in new technology to support national security for the U.S. and our allies. We are focused on competing and winning the programs that enable continued growth and affordably delivering the capability our customers need. This quarter was another demonstration of our commitment to maintain strong returns and cash flows while growing the business. I'll turn the call over to Dave now for a more detailed discussion of our financial guidance, results and trends. Dave?
Dave Keffer: Thanks, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. I'd also like to thank our team for another quarter of outstanding performance. My comments begin with Q1 sales growth on Slide 4, which provides a bridge between our first quarter of 2020 and first quarter of 2021. We reported Q1 sales growth of approximately 6%. And as you can see, the IT services divestiture was an approximately $400 million headwind to first quarter sales. In addition, due to the timing of our accounting calendar convention, we had three more working days in the first quarter of 2021 than in the first quarter of 2020. We view this tailwind as purely timing as it normalizes in Q4 when we will have four fewer days than in the fourth quarter of 2020. The three additional days in Q1 2021 result in an approximately 5% benefit to sales across all of our segments for your modeling purposes. So at the consolidated level, the divestiture and extra working days are largely offsetting for Q1. Adjusting for these two items, revenue growth was 6.4%. As I review the sector results, I'll refer to organic sales growth, adjusting only for the IT services divestiture. Slide 5 provides a bridge of our earnings per share between first quarter 2020 and first quarter 2021. GAAP earnings per share increased to $13.43, primarily due to the gain on sale. When we adjust for the divestiture-related items, transaction adjusted earnings per share are up 28% to $6.57. The increase reflects strong segment performance, which drove $0.75 of the year-over-year improvement. Recovery in the equity markets generated favorable earnings on our marketable securities, especially compared to the volatility we experienced in the equity markets last March. Corporate unallocated expense contributed $0.27, primarily due to lower state tax and lower amortization expense in the period. Referring to sector results on Slide 6. Aeronautics Systems sales were up 5% for the quarter, reflecting higher Manned Aircraft sales due to stronger on restricted programs and E2D, partially offset by lower sales in Autonomous Systems as certain global hub production programs near completion. At Defense Systems, first quarter sales decreased 17% or 2% on an organic basis. Lower organic sales reflect the closeout of our Lake City activities, which represented a headwind of roughly $140 million this quarter. Higher volume on GMLRS and AARGM helped to offset that impact. Turning to Mission Systems, we saw a third consecutive quarter of double-digit sales growth, with revenues up 10% or 15% on an organic basis. Organic sales were higher in all four MS business areas as its diversified portfolio continues its strong momentum from last year. In Airborne Multifunction Sensors, we had higher volume for the Sabre and Meso radar programs and higher restricted sales. Maritime land systems and sensors increased primarily due to ramp up on the G/ATOR program as well as higher volume on marine systems. Navigation, targeting and survivability sales increased principally due to higher volume on targeting programs, including LITNING. Networked Information Solutions sales were driven by higher volume on electronic warfare programs, including JCREW and restricted programs. Space systems continues to be our fastest-growing segment, with sales up 29% in the quarter, or 32% on an organic basis. Sales were higher in both business areas, with continued ramp-up on the GBSD program, driving revenue growth in launch and strategic missiles. Space programs were driven by higher volume on restricted programs, NASA's Artemis programs and the next-gen OPIR program. Turning to operating income on Slide 7. Segment operating income includes a Q1 benefit of approximately $100 million from lower overhead rates, a reflection of our disciplined approach to cost and affordability. This quarter's benefit includes the reduction in projected CAS pension costs that we mentioned on last quarter's call. While lower CAS costs do present a modest revenue and cash flow headwind going forward, they improve our competitiveness by making our solutions more affordable, and that will be a key competitive differentiator in a flattening budget environment. At AS, operating income increased 17% and margin rate increased to 10.3% due to higher net favorable EAC adjustments driven by reduced overhead rates. Defense Systems' operating income decreased 11%, primarily due to the IT services divestiture, and operating margin rate increased 80 basis points to 11.3%. The increase in operating margin rate was largely driven by improved performance in battle management and missile systems programs. Operating income at Mission Systems rose 12%, and operating margin rate increased to 15.3%. Higher operating income reflects higher sales as well as the benefit recognized from reduced overhead rates, partially offset by lower net favorable EAC adjustments at Network Information Solutions. Space Systems operating income increased 37%, primarily due to higher sales volume. Operating margin rate rose to 10.9% due to higher net favorable EAC adjustments, driven by the reduction in overhead rates. At the total company level, segment operating income increased 13% in Q1, and operating margin rate increased to 12%. Higher operating income was driven principally by favorable overhead rates, as well as operational performance at the sectors, which more than offset the lower business base due to the IT services divestiture. Turning to sector guidance on Slide 8. As a result of a continued robust growth in our Space business and the recent win of the NGI program, we are increasing Space sales guidance to approximately $10 billion. Sales guidance remains unchanged for AS, DS and MS, as does operating margin rate guidance at all four sectors. Moving to consolidated guidance. Slide 9 provides a bridge to our updated guidance, reflecting the improvement in operations as well as the effects of the divestiture on our overall outlook. We are raising our 2021 sales and transaction adjusted EPS guidance to reflect the strength of first quarter results. We now expect 2021 sales will range between $35.3 billion and $35.7 billion, a $200 million increase to prior guidance. Keep in mind that our fourth quarter year-over-year revenue comparison will include headwinds of fewer working days and the $444 million equipment sale at AS in addition to the divestiture. Our updated guidance on corporate unallocated expenses is driven by the net gain on the IT services transaction and also reflects favorable deferred state tax benefits and other lower unallocated costs. Our operating margin rate guidance includes both the lower corporate unallocated expense and the benefit from the divestiture. Moving to taxes. You can see the estimated tax rate reflects the impact from the divestiture, and our underlying effective tax rate is unchanged. Our year-end weighted average diluted shares count guidance has been reduced to reflect the ASR. Turning to EPS. Slide 10 provides a bridge between our January guidance and today's transaction adjusted guidance. We are increasing our transaction adjusted EPS to a range of $24 to $24.50 from our prior guidance range of $23.15 to $23.65. Our higher guidance reflects strong segment performance as well as lower corporate unallocated expenses, favorable pension trends and lower weighted average shares outstanding. Lastly, I want to take a moment to talk about cash. We continue to pursue a balanced capital deployment strategy that includes investing in the business, returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and managing the balance sheet. In the first quarter, we delevered our balance sheet, obtained improved ratings from two credit rating agencies and executed the ASR program to further reduce our share count. The recently passed American Rescue Plan Act is expected to begin affecting our CAS pension recoveries in 2022. Asset returns and other actuarial assumptions will continue to influence these numbers. But all else being equal, the legislation would further reduce our CAS recoveries. I'd also note that we had already lowered our projected CAS pension cost to a relatively low level in our January outlook, primarily due to outstanding asset performance in 2020. I'd reiterate that we expect minimal cash pension contributions over the next several years. As Kathy mentioned, first quarter operating cash flow increased more than $900 million from Q1 2020. This improvement largely reflects timing of collections and disbursements, and we have not changed our transaction-adjusted free cash flow or capital expenditure guidance for the year. It's worth mentioning that while the divestiture of the IT services business closed in Q1, federal and state cash taxes of approximately $800 million will be paid over the remainder of the year. In closing, we are very pleased with our first quarter results as we continue to deliver for our customers, employees and shareholders. Our portfolio's shaping and continued investment in the business put us in a strong position to sustain our momentum in value creation and robust cash generation. Okay, Todd. I think we're ready for Q&A.
Todd Ernst: Mariama, please inform the analysts how they enter the queue and ask questions. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Your line is open.
Robert Stallard: Kathy, on Space, clearly, a very strong quarter here and tracking very nicely for another strong year. But how do you see this going forward? You're obviously going to be up against a tough comparison in 2022, for example, but you have got this new NGI wins. So I was wondering if you could give us some idea of what is sort of sustainable top line growth rate could be for this division.
Kathy Warden: Well, without getting into specific outlook for 2022, let me talk about some of the major drivers that we see. You noted that GBSD will have a tougher compare '22 to '21 because we'll have a full year of GBSD this year. However, I would point to the fact that GBSD is expected to continue to ramp into 2022. The budget shows another, approximately $1 billion increase going from '21 to 2022. So not all of that is the Northrop Grumman program. That's the entire budget. But you can see that there is still escalation and growth anticipated for the program going into next year. But more importantly, as you highlighted, there are other activities that we have underway that have a growth profile from '21 to '22. NGI is one of those. The other two awards that I mentioned today are to others. And so we do see the opportunity for Space to continue to grow. It is true that when we look at this business, it grew 18% last year. We are projecting high-teen growth again this year. So those are very robust growth rates. But we do see the potential for Space to continue to be a growth driver for our business and indeed, our fastest-growing segment.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Crédit Suisse. Your line is open.
Robert Spingarn: Just sticking with Space. Kathy, you touched on this a little earlier in your prepared remarks, but you've had some really nice success recently with Space logistics and your satellite mission extension vehicle. Wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on the opportunity longer-term and update us on how discussions with customers are trending now that the technology is proven. And just wondering if satellite MRO can ultimately be comparable to something like aviation MRO as a very strong recurring business?
Kathy Warden: Thanks for the question, Rob. We certainly see this business is transforming the way companies think about satellite life extension. And we see that with Intelsat, and of course, we started in the commercial space. Because we had in Intelsat, a willing partner to pioneer with us, and that's really what this is. As I noted, we're still the only company providing this kind of mission life extension capability. And Intelsat has been a fabulous partner in being able to demonstrate those capabilities on two of their satellites. And MEV-2 is docked with a satellite that is currently providing mission service. MEV-1, I'll remind you, was taking a satellite that was out of service and bringing it back to service. So as we continue to demonstrate that we can even dock with a moving satellite, providing service and not disrupt those services, I do expect that other customers will see the value. And that business will continue to grow. We also see the opportunity, as we work with our defense customers, to bring those capabilities to military and special systems that our national security relies upon, now that we have demonstrated the capability with commercial clients.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Seth Seifman: I wanted to ask about -- so Aeronautics, you called out the headwind in autonomous, and that's something that you've discussed before. Does that headwind go away by the end of this year? Or does it persist into 2022 on Global Hawk? And I guess, are there any other sort of legacy type of platforms we should be thinking about that might come into the budget cross hairs going forward?
Dave Keffer: Sure, Seth, it's Dave. I'll get started on that one for you. So yes. As you noted, the Manned Portfolio in AS outgrew the unmanned in Q1. Overall, the sector delivered a strong 5% organic growth rate year-over-year and does project organic growth for the full year, when you exclude the unique equipment sale from last year. In terms of the headwinds you mentioned around Global Hawk. Certainly, there are puts and takes on the Global Hawk program and on the HALE portfolio altogether and no more when we see the updated budget numbers in the coming weeks. But I think in aggregate, it's been a strong start to 2021 for the AS portfolio. There are pockets of new opportunity in the unmanned business has been in the news in recent months. Certainly, we have healthy long-term opportunity set in unmanned. And we'll see about the trajectory of the current HALE portfolio. I think in general, that's a flatter portfolio than some of our other higher growth product sets on the manned side that we've talked about in the past. So again, we'll provide more guidance on '22 and beyond as we get further into this year. But that at least gives you a thumbnail sketch of what we're seeing in AS.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Your line is open.
Carter Copeland: Kathy, I wonder, if I could just ask briefly about the F-35. I think once it go beyond lots 14 and get to 15, 16, 17, the number of aircraft in those lots is planning to step down a little bit. I know you guys have a bit of a lead in terms of the revenue recognition on your own cost and your own work on that program versus what we may see from the prime contractor. And I just wondered, maybe give us some perspective on the timing of that, and what it means for that F-35 business in those revenues, how we should be thinking about that going forward?
Kathy Warden: So Carter, as we look at F-35 in its three pieces, I think you're primarily asking about production volume. And, in particular, at Aeronautics, we see that volume relatively flat for the next few years based on the demand signal that we've gotten from Lockheed and what they ask us to quote. Now price continues to come down as we do our part to contribute to the affordability of the aircraft. So that's a little bit of an offset to a flat volume. At the same time, so when you look at the other pieces of the program, modernization and sustainment, those are growing over that period of time. And so all in all, we see our F-35 franchise within Northrop Grumman being relatively flat over the next several years.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Maybe how do you guys think about productivity and margin opportunities post divestiture here? Great margins in the first quarter, 12% ahead of your guidance. When we think about the remainder of the year, whether it's mix or R&D, what sort of headwinds come up? And I guess, how do you think about profitability now that you've streamlined the portfolio?
Dave Keffer: Sure. Thanks, Sheila. So as you mentioned, we're off to a really strong start in Q1 on the margin front, both in terms of rate and dollar volume at a 12% rate for the first quarter. That is ahead of our full year guide of 11.5% to 11.7% segment OM rate. I'd note that from a timing perspective, Q1 did benefit from the lower overhead rates as we talked about, a portion of which was driven by the lower CAS pension costs and the rest of which was really just strong cost management across the business, overcoming the lower base from the divestiture and such. So we're really pleased with the level of disciplined cost management that we've already demonstrated in 2021. As we look to the rest of the year, we continue to project that 11 05 to 1107 segment OM rate, which is 10 basis points to 30 basis points better than last year's performance, which was already at a strong level of 11.4%. Going forward, I think you're right to think of mix as one of the drivers. But obviously, we'll continue to strive operationally for both efficiency and the way we execute the program and the deliver product, as well as the way we manage the business. Our digital transformation efforts are a good example of that efficiency initiative, again, having been touted on some of our key and newer programs. And certainly, that's also part and parcel of the way we're looking to manage the overall business with as much efficiency and consistency as we can to really deliver that affordability and cost efficiency that drives continued strong margins over time.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Your line is open.
George Shapiro: If you could it looks like the EAC or the CAS benefit of about $100 million, that's consistent with the drop in CAS you projected in Q4. So I assume there's been no change from the ARPU -- from ARPU as a result of that. And then also, what's your current pre-funding level for CAS? And how does that play out over time?
Dave Keffer: The current pre-funding level is just under $2 billion, it was as of the first of the year this year. The ARPU adjustment to CAS are more limited in their impact to the business in 2021 than the benefits we've talked about in terms of Q1 EACs, which were primarily driven by the asset performance and other actuarial changes as of our last earnings call when we provided the broader outlook. I think what I'd point you to is we've already reduced those CAS pension projections substantially in the January call down to levels of $240 million next year, $340 million in 2023. So there's limited ongoing reduction possible from the ARPU changes. And obviously, there will be other effects or other influences on that number very much to include ongoing asset returns from pension. So it's a modest headwind to free cash flow and even more modest to revenue going forward. In Q1, it was one of the items contributing to the strong margin rate. But obviously, we continue to project a healthy margin rate for the full year, and thus, for the remaining quarters, driven by the strong programming performance and the continued strong cost management we've talked about.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jon Raviv with Citigroup. Your line is open.
Jon Raviv: Kathy, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you're seeing that majority or most of your free cash flow going to shareholders over the next few years. Just what's behind -- what's the perspective on talking about that kind of dynamic in terms of how you see the market developing here and what your other capital deployment opportunities are? And then within that context, any preliminary thoughts on how you're thinking about that free cash flow opportunity over multiple years versus this year's free cash flow guide? Any particular big moving pieces we should be aware of, like payroll tax or the R&D dynamic?
Kathy Warden: So why don't we have Dave start with the second part of your question, which will give you more sense of the capital we have to deploy, and then I'll talk to the deployment strategy.
Dave Keffer: Sure. Thanks, Kathy. So as we talked about on our last call, our guidance for free cash flow for this year of $3 billion to $3.3 billion requires working capital management improvements from 2020. And we're really pleased with the start we've gotten off to in 2021, having already delivered on some of those working capital enhancements. And you can see the really strong year-over-year compare of our Q1 '21 free cash flow to Q1 2020. So that gives us a good feeling for free cash flow as we enter the final three quarters of the year. Over the next few years, obviously, we'll provide more insights in the coming quarters. But I think you touched on a few of the right points. Certainly, first and foremost for us is what's in our control, and that is continued really strong working capital management in the business, efficiency in our billing and collections process, efficiency in the way we manage our supply base on the payable side, while continuing to maintain a healthy supply base as we have through the accelerated payments we've made now over the last year plus. So those are all critical factors for us on the operational side. We do expect capital expenditures to continue to -- or to come down in '22 and beyond as a percentage of revenue, as we've signaled in the past. And then you get into some of the CAS pension dynamics I mentioned shortly ago, which should have -- should be a modest headwind if all else is equal. Obviously, it remains to be seen what influence asset returns and overall market conditions have on CAS pension going forward. And so we'll update you there as we see the year progress. And then on the tax side, new legislation possible certainly to remove the existing R&D amortization rules scheduled to go in place in '22 that would be favorable for us. There's obviously also discussion of the long-term corporate tax rate that could influence our cash taxes going forward. So again, our first priority is what we can control, and we're optimistic about continuing to drive really strong cash flows from the operations of the business. Kathy, over to you for capital deployment.
Kathy Warden: Thanks, Dave. And so as Dave outlined, our capital deployment strategy has remained consistent. We invest in the business, but we have signaled and continued to see our CapEx as a percentage of revenue starting to come down in 2022, just based on the opportunity set that we have and the robust investments that we've been doing over the last couple of years. We've also been active in portfolio shaping and are pleased with the portfolio that we have now and its alignment to the National Defense strategy. So we've been using proceeds to mature our cash balance and really get to a place for our balance sheet is where we'd like it to be. And we're in a position, therefore, to now focus on dividends and share repurchase. So my comments really reflect that as we sit here today, that we do expect the majority of our cash proceeds over the next couple of years will go to those two methods of returning cash to shareholders.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss with Barclays. Your line is open.
David Strauss: I wanted to touch on the Space margins. They were up a fair amount despite 30-some percent growth, I assume most of that being on a cost-plus basis. So could you maybe, Dave, touch on why the Space margins start to come down from here based on your guidance? And then I know you touched on additional working days you had in Q1. But I think your sales -- implied sales guidance for Q1 both came in -- your sales came in well above your implied guidance. So was there any sort of pull forward in the quarter or anything that -- other than the working days that kind of reverses go -- or goes back the other way later in the year?
Dave Keffer: Sure. Two good topics there I'm happy to touch on. First, as it relates to Space margins. Space was one of the segments that did benefit from the overhead rate reduction in Q1, which, of course, lifted their margin rate performance in the quarter. The expansion of their base is also a contributor there and the efficiency with which they executed their programs in the quarter and with which they manage the business were both contributors as well. It was a really strong operational quarter for Space, building on a really strong 2020 for Space. For the rest of the year, I wouldn't signal any dramatic change there. Obviously, we have this full year margin rate guidance around 10%, consistent with the past guidance for Space and reflective of the mix moving more towards cost type development work, as you mentioned, but obviously off to a strong start there in part due to those EAC benefits because of the operational and cost efficiency in the quarter. You mentioned the working days and the overall revenue profile for the year. It's, I think, an important topic to talk through because there are a couple of moving pieces there. So let me give you a bit of a sense for some of the key quarterly items there. Q1 did include a month of the now divested IT services business. And as we've mentioned, about a 5% benefit in each sector from the additional three working days. In terms of other items, I would say, in general, we had strength at the end of the quarter in terms of the timing of materials and deliveries, which did benefit the quarter. I would call that broad-based across the businesses, not any one particular program or sector. Thinking about the rest of the year, Q4, as we mentioned in our scripted remarks, will be a tough compare. It will have four fewer working days than the prior year. And as we mentioned on our last call, Q4 of 2020 benefited by the $444 million equipment sale in AS. So on top of the divestiture impact on Q4 compare from a revenue perspective, we'll have those other two unique items. As we think about Q2 and Q3, we expect continued solid organic growth in those quarters, consistent with what we've been able to deliver of late. From a GAAP sales perspective, those will be offset by the divestiture, of course. But again, really strong momentum in the business of late, and that's reflected in our guidance. And in particular, in the $200 million increase that we provided to our sales guidance with the bottom and the top end of that range. As we enter Q2, Q3 and beyond, we'll continue to have an eye on strength of new business performance and backlog success as the year progresses and evaluate our outlook further as the year continues.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. Your line is open.
Cai von Rumohr: Yes. So Kathy, with the decreasing cost of access to Space and the increasing capability of smaller LEO satellites, there's been kind of a proliferation of lots of these smaller satellite builders and rocket builders getting large amounts from stacks. Do you have any aspirations for any forward integration into launchers or commercial -- additional new commercial space ventures? Because it looks like you guys have the capability to do so.
Kathy Warden: Okay, I appreciate the question. And the reflection on the breadth of our portfolio, you're absolutely right. We already are an important partner to launch providers, including companies that we've been working with and some that are newer entrants into the space. We are working with companies that are new entrants into the defense space that provide unique capabilities in areas like communication or other areas of expertise that we feel can be applied to national security. But our focus, really as a company, remains on our expertise in National Security space. That's where the predominance of the growth in our portfolio is coming from today. And we'll look to use capabilities and products that we build for commercial and space exploration applications just as we do today. But you can expect the predominance of Northrop Grumman's investment as well as our growth to continue to come from National Security space.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. You line is open.
Kristine Liwag: Kathy, following up on Cai's question about some of these new space companies. I guess what we're seeing with your peers is that they're starting to invest in strategic partnerships. We've seen that with Lockheed and ABL and Raytheon and HawkEye 360. How do you think about strategic partnerships to expand your national security offerings in Space? Would you pursue that, do M&A or invest organically? And are there areas of your portfolio that you're interested in bolstering?
Kathy Warden: So we're really pleased with the acquisition that we did with Orbital ATK to build out our space portfolio, we saw that as our big investment and as you know, they brought not only capability in National Security space, but commercial space and civil space exploration as well. And so we're quite confident that our portfolio allows us to participate across that wide spectrum of growth and investment in space. We also have partnerships. We tend not to advertise those partnerships, and they aren't always aligned with an investment in other companies, but they are relationships that we have, providing our capability to and through them, or their capability through us to our customers. Look, at the end of the day, we see new entrants in the market as partners in areas like launch, comms, exploration. And the investment that they're making is oftentimes complementary to ours. But we combine them on a solution-by-solution basis, because that's the business that we're in. We look for the best partner for each system that we are bidding and delivering. And so that's been our partnership model, and I expect that to continue to be our partnership model.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Ron Epstein: So Kathy, on the heels of the NGI down select, GBSD, had some really important wins recently. When we look out in the pipeline, what are you looking at next? What's the team focused on or kind of key areas or key programs that you'd like to win in the near-term and maybe even in the medium term?
Kathy Warden: So Ron two years ago, when I sit into the role, I talked a lot about the desire for the company to focus in on campaign areas that were closely aligned to where we believe the National Defense strategy with Space investment, and we continue to believe that those campaigns are focused in the right areas. We see Space continuing to grow faster than other parts of the market, and we see ourselves being able to continue to grow our portfolio and take share there. Strategic missiles continues to be an important area. Our work on GBSD, the down-select, on NGI, so now the interceptor side of that equation, as well as more modernization that the Missile Defense Agency has to do in protective systems against [adversary] CBM, and we see that stretching across domain. So even in Space, we see a tremendous amount of free capitalization in missile tracking and the ability to detect new missile types, like hypersonics and I talked about the HBTSS award that we have. So space and missiles, very complementary in terms of our strategic focus in both of those areas and still more growth that we see in both of those. Another key area that we've been focused on is joint all-domain command and control. And we were doing it before it was called JADC2 with programs like IBCS, which really fit what the government looks for in being able to integrate sensors and shooters and provide that sort of architecture. It has elements of communications and connectivity, which is an investment area, an area of technical excellence for our company. It has elements of computing and the advancement that's needed to process fortune office data it has advancements in artificial intelligence. And these are all areas that our company continues to invest in and have leadership positions in. So those are just a few examples of the campaigns that we outlined in 2019 that we continue to execute against and see good success. So no new strategy. It's continuing to execute that strategy, which is working well for us and still have legs, we believe, well into the future.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein. Your line is open.
Doug Harned: When you look at Northrop Grumman's position now, you're a major player on major airborne space platforms. But you've -- you're also important provider of electronic systems to other platforms. If you go back historically, there's always been this tension where people have tried to have a platform and then ensure that their own systems get on it. And then those have been typically shot down and they've been competed separately. So today, since you're on both sides of this, when you look at the way technology is evolving, the way the threat is evolving, how do you see the competitive landscape? Do you think it will stay the same? Do you think there'll be the ability for people to try and vertically integrate more between platforms and systems? Where do you see this going?
Kathy Warden: So Doug, it's an excellent question and one that we spend a lot of time thinking about strategically because our portfolio, as you know, does have a good bit of vertical integration opportunity. But that doesn't mean that it's always the right answer to put our systems on our platform. And so we take a very objective look when we are an integrator onto a platform at where the best technology comes from. And that may be inside of Northrop Grumman, it may be with an industry partner. And to the earlier point in Space, increasingly, maybe new entrants and companies that aren't particularly focused on National Security, but have capability to bring to bear. I would also, though, point out that being a strong competitor in Mission Systems and being able to have the technology that is the winning technology on a platform means that you have to invest and that you have to prioritize in that area, and we have done that quite successfully. So there are many cases where our technology is the best to go on a platform. And even if it's not our platform and another company's desire to vertically integrate, they will not choose, I don't believe, to put their own kit on a platform if it's not the best technology to compete at the platform level. And we've seen that play out time and time again, where there was a fear that our Mission Systems would not be selected by other competitors because they would want to integrate their own capabilities. But at the end of the day, it's incumbent upon the platform primes, our self included, to make unbiased choices and look at what is the best capability to provide to our ultimate customer to meet the requirements. And that's where our Mission Systems team has excelled staying at the forefront of technology so that we do compete and we emerge as the best provider. It's why our Mission Systems business has a good deal of full force work. I talked about the F-16 upgrades on the radar, but also the EW fleet now that we're working with the Air Force that is because we have the best technology. And we are now being selected to move to deliver that capability.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Maugeri of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Mike Maugeri: Dave, you mentioned that lower CAS expense, it can help make you a little bit more competitive in a flattening budget environment. So in light of that point, I just want to ask, how do you think about B&P discipline and a flattening or contracting budget environment relative to when the budget is expanding?
Dave Keffer: Sure. We look across our businesses at investment opportunities, both capital expenditures, R&D, B&P, and really make decisions specific to the market conditions and market opportunity sets that we see in different parts of the business. With the overall budget flattening, are expected to flatten over the coming years, we still have a space business that grew nearly 30% this quarter and over 30% last quarter. And so clearly, the opportunity set there is such that significant ongoing investment in R&D and capital expenditures, B&P has been the right decision for the company to have made and continues to be. We have a very healthy outlook there. Really across the business, I wouldn't say we're yet feeling opportunity constrained. And so certainly, we are careful with our investment dollars, and we look at returns on investment dollars in each of those buckets. But at this point, we continue to see a healthy opportunity set in the markets we serve. And to make appropriate investments as a result. Our R&D costs are continuing to be around 3% of revenue, and that's been a healthy level for us over the last couple of years, continues at approximately that level in 2021. I'd certainly put B&P in that same category, again, reflective of the positioning we have with the faster-growing parts of the budget.
Todd Ernst: Mariama, we have time for one more question.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with UBS. Your line is open.
Myles Walton: Maybe a clarification, Dave, on the slide deck, you called out $0.35 from corporate unallocated. Just how much of that is more corporate unallocated run rate as opposed to one-off? And then, Kathy, as you look at Talent acquisition, I think you grew the workforce, 7,000 or so in 2020. Given the pipeline of business that you're having, what is the market for growing that pipeline? And where do you think that number might end up at the end of '21.
Dave Keffer: Sure. On the lower corporate unallocated, I'd call that a mix of items more unique to this year and other items that will be sustained in future years. As we mentioned, the state tax costs are a bit lower this year than we had anticipated. In other areas, there's ongoing careful cost management and discipline that's led to that efficiency. So I'd call it a mix on that front.
Kathy Warden: And Myles, on our Talent strategy and specifically the growth that we expect. We hired almost 14,000 people last year. And as you noted, yielded about 7,000 new headcount, and that's largely because attrition has slowed. And we expect that, that will continue into this year. But perhaps with other companies beginning to grow and the labor market tightening that could go up. So we expect to net about the same headcount growth this year, but we're monitoring closely the moving parts of how many hires we need to make with another attrition to get there.
Todd Ernst: Okay. We'll leave it there. I'll turn it over to Kathy for closing remarks.
Kathy Warden: Well, thanks, Todd. As you've heard, the year is off to a great start with our new awards. We had robust sales growth and strong margins in the quarter. And I want to recognize that the foundation of executing our strategy is the strength of this team and their outstanding performance. So let me conclude by once again thanking the Northrop Grumman team for their innovation and hard work. So that concludes our call. We look forward to talking to you again next quarter and thanks for joining.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-01-28 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2020 Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. My name is Shelby, and I'll be your operator today. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Todd Ernst, Treasurer and Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Ernst, please proceed.
Todd Ernst: Thanks, Shelby. And welcome to Northrop Grumman's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020 Conference Call. We'll refer to a PowerPoint presentation that is posted on our IR web page this morning.  Before we start, matters discussed on today's call, including guidance and the outlook for 2021 and beyond, reflect the company's judgment based on information available at the time of this call. They constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to safe harbor provisions of federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements include risks and uncertainties, which are noted in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties may cause actual company results to differ materially.  Matters discussed on today's call will include non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled in our earnings release and supplemental PowerPoint presentation. Our GAAP results reflect the mark-to-market method of accounting for our pension and other post-retirement benefits.  Our references to adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share on today's call will refer to earnings and EPS adjusted for mark-to-market impact. We also refer to adjusted free cash flow defined as operating cash flow, less capital expenditures and plus the proceeds of the sale of equipment to a customer and the after-tax impact of discretionary pension contributions. These are non-GAAP measures defined in our earnings release. Our 2021 guidance assumes the intended IT Services divestiture closes very soon.  On the call today are Kathy Warden, our Chairman, CEO and President; and Dave Keffer, our CFO.  At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kathy. Kathy?
Kathy Warden: Thank you, Todd. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I want to congratulate the Northrop Grumman team for delivering outstanding 2020 results. I applaud our employee support for one another, our customers and our communities in the face of 2020's multiple challenges. Together with our suppliers and partners, we operated through the pandemic, executed well on our programs, maintained superior performance on critical global security missions and one program that strengthen our foundation for the future.  We began 2020 operating in a new sector structure, which further aligns our unique capabilities in Space, Missiles, Advanced Weapons, Mission Systems and Aeronautics. This alignment enables the capture of additional revenue synergies, particularly in Space and Advanced Weapons, as well as continued identification of operating synergies. Our 2020 results are tangible evidence that our strategy is creating value. We had exceptionally strong fourth quarter operational performance. And for the full year, we had strong bookings, exceeded the high end of our guidance range for sales, EPS and adjusted free cash flow and delivered strong segment operating income through continued focus on performance and operating efficiencies.  For the third consecutive year, we achieved a book-to-bill greater than 1. New awards in 2020 totaled nearly $53 billion or 1.4x sales, and total backlog increased 25% and to $81 billion. Sales rose 9% to $36.8 billion, and segment operating margin rate was 11.4%. Adjusted EPS increased 11.5% to $23.65, and adjusted free cash flow increased 18% to approximately $3.7 billion. All 4 sectors captured important new awards, hosted higher sales and operating income and sustained strong operating margin rates.  As expected, our Space business, in its new configuration, led growth in backlog and sales. 2020 results demonstrate Space Systems' growing ability to drive the development of innovative and affordable offerings for our national security, civil and commercial customers. We booked new business in each of these 3 markets, more than doubled Space Systems' backlog and increased sales by 18%. In addition to $9 billion of restricted space awards, we were awarded GBSD, the most recent addition to our diverse portfolio of multi-decade, multibillion-dollar franchise program. Looking ahead, we expect Space Systems will continue to be our fastest-growing sector based on GBSD and the planned recapitalization of our nation's space assets. The funding for space-based capabilities increased 6% in the U.S. DoD FY '21 budget, with growth expected to continue.  At Aeronautics Systems, we booked solid awards, including $6 billion for restricted programs, and substantial awards for F-35, Triton, E-2D and Global Hawk. AS sales significantly exceeded our revenue guidance, principally due to an equipment sale to a restricted customer in the fourth quarter. We continue to perform well on large franchise programs like F-35, E-2D and B-21. Our F-35 integrated assembly line received Aviation Week's Laureate Award in defense manufacturing for revolutionizing military aircraft production through human ingenuity and advanced digital technology. And as you may have read, the U.S. Air Force recently disclosed the production of the second B-21 stealth bomber is underway. And that the first Raider is expected to roll out and fly in 2022.  The team is making tremendous progress, and our partnership with the Air Force is strong. We are pleased with the maturity of the hardware and software, including recent flight testing on a surrogate test bed. Air Force leaders say these efforts, along with the team's modern approach to digital engineering, gives them a lot of confidence about the program's pass to first flight. I share this confidence, and our team looks forward to delivering the affordable and highly capable next-generation bomber our nation requires.  In AS, our advanced technologies and integration expertise are well aligned to meet the requirements of next-generation systems. Our programs are performing well, and we're focused on near-term opportunities to drive operational efficiencies and margin rate expansion.  Defense Systems' results were also strong and reflect growth in core capabilities like C2, advanced weapon systems and sustainment and modernization. Earlier this month, the U.S. Army authorized our IBCS system to proceed to low-rate initial production following a successful limited user test in September and Milestone C approval in December. This is a critical next step in moving IBCS closer to future deployment for the U.S. Army and Poland, and it demonstrates the continuing success of our C2 approach. We look forward to competing for the U.S. Army full rate production contract, which we expect will be awarded late this year. In addition, we continue to pursue additional international opportunities for IBCS as we demonstrate how that architecture can support joint all-domain command and control.  Mission Systems' leadership in network open architecture mission systems continues to be a competitive differentiator as demonstrated by program milestones and new business awards. MS recently conducted a successful demonstration as part of the Air Force's Joint All-Domain Command and Control effort, also known as to JADC2. Our gateway technology enabled F-35, F-22 and other platforms to share data across multiple paths for the first time. We expect to continue providing the underlying technology needed to enable the department's JADC2 vision. And this month, MS was chosen by the Air Force to be the sole provider of the F-16 electronic warfare suite, which will equip as many as 450 F-16s, replacing several legacy systems with a modern digital solution. This work has a potential value of $2.5 billion.  In addition to next-generation capabilities for F-35 and F-16, MS is on the team Japan selected as their FX integration support partner. Our team brings proven experience in fifth-generation technologies to ensure FX capabilities and interoperability to strengthen the Japan-U.S. alliance. We look forward to working with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, the FX prime contractor.  With its deep portfolio of sensor technology and integration expertise, MS is enabling the modernization of weapon systems with the latest digital technology that provides our customers the capability to the detect and defeat advanced status areas in the electronic spectrum, providing the foundation for profitable growth.  Northrop Grumman's portfolio remains well aligned with the national defense strategy, and supports critical modernization efforts underway to address evolving threats. As you are aware, the Congress passed the 2021 National Defense Authorization and approved appropriations of approximately $740 billion for discretionary defense spending. Northrop Grumman programs were well supported in the budget, and we continue to have a robust opportunity set, including next-generation interceptor, 3DELRR, the upcoming F-35 block buy and multiple restricted opportunities.  Our success in growing the business and expanding earnings is delivering cash to support our capital deployment strategy. 2020 cash from operations totaled $4.9 billion before a $750 million discretionary pension contribution, and adjusted free cash flow totaled approximately $3.7 billion or about $22 per share. Our strong liquidity enabled robust investment in our business, strengthening of our balance sheet, a 17th consecutive annual dividend increase and $490 million in share repurchases in 2020.  As we begin 2021 with $5 billion of cash on hand at year-end and expected net proceeds of approximately $2.5 billion from the divestiture of our IT services business, we have the resources and flexibility to take aggressive value-creating actions. These include robust investment for growth, continuing strengthening of our balance sheet and the return of cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.  Today, we announced that our Board has approved a $3 billion increase in our share repurchase authority, raising the total outstanding authorization to $5.8 billion. We expect to use more than $3 billion for 2021 share repurchases. And beyond 2021, we expect share repurchase will continue to be a high priority use of our discretionary free cash flow, while we also continue to maintain a strong balance sheet and strengthen our platform for growth through disciplined investment and selective M&A.  Turning to guidance, which now includes the pending IT services divestiture. The 2021 outlook reflects organic sales growth and segment margin rate expansion. We expect sales between $35.1 billion and $35.5 billion, with a segment operating margin rate of 11.5% to 11.7%. We now expect adjusted EPS, excluding the gain on sale and onetime transaction-related costs, to range between $23.15 and $23.65. And adjusted free cash flow of $3 billion to $3.3 billion.  While delivering financial results is a primary company focus, we are very proud of our ESG record and earned high marks in many environmental and social ranking. We achieved a leadership, A- CDP ranking for environmental sustainability for the ninth consecutive year. And we earned a place in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index-North America for the fifth consecutive year. DiversityInc named us a Top 50 Company for Diversity, ranking us 15th, and Northrop Grumman was the only aerospace and defense company that earned a place in Equileap's Top 25 Gender Equality Index.  In addition, we remain mindful of the role our products and services play around the world. As we continue to consider our portfolio, we have decided to exit by year's end, a legacy Orbital ATK aging and surveillance contract that supports testing of cluster munition components. In our endeavors to enable global security and human advancement, we recognize the importance of our environmental, social and governance responsibilities, and we expect to continue leading our industry forward.  In closing, I want to thank the nearly 100,000 members of the Northrop Grumman team for this year's outstanding performance. And particularly, I want to recognize the more than 6,000 employees who will become part of the Peraton team upon closing of our IT services divestiture for their contributions to Northrop Grumman.  I'll turn the call over to Dave now for a more detailed discussion of our financial results, guidance and trends. Dave?
David Keffer: Okay. Thanks, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. I also want to thank the team for their outstanding performance in the fourth quarter and the full year. I'll spend a few minutes on 2020 results and then discuss our 2021 guidance in more detail, including the planned effects of the IT services divestiture and the latest updates to our pension metrics.  Beginning with the highlights on Slide 3. We exceeded the high ends of our guidance ranges for revenue, adjusted EPS and adjusted free cash flow in 2020. Revenue grew 17% in Q4 and 9% for the full year as a result of our robust bookings over the last 2 years and our team's strong performance across all 4 sectors. The potential upside in AS sales that we noted last quarter did occur in Q4 as we booked a $444 million equipment sale in our restricted portfolio. Revenue growth for the quarter and the year were quite strong, even excluding this unique item, especially in light of impacts from the continuing pandemic.  As shown on Slide 5, our mark-to-market adjusted EPS grew 17% from Q4 of 2019 to Q4 of 2020, driven by $0.42 of segment performance, as well as $0.35 of net pension costs and $0.21 of tax, interest and other items.  Slide 6 shows the full year view. Adjusted EPS grew 11.5% in 2020, driven again by segment performance and net pension costs with higher net interest expense, partially offset by tax, share count and other items. Referring to sector results on Slide 7. Aeronautics Systems sales rose 24% for the quarter and 9% for the year, largely due to higher levels of restricted activity in both periods. Higher restricted volume reflects in part the equipment sale I noted. The $444 million of revenue was booked in Q4, along with an immaterial amount of associated margin. The cash proceeds from the sale will be spread between 2020, in which we received $205 million in 2021 when we expect to receive the remaining $239 million. Excluding this item, higher volume for Manned Aircraft programs, primarily restricted in the E-2D, drove fourth quarter growth in AS. For the year, both Manned Aircraft and Autonomous Systems contributed to growth, with restricted programs, E-2D and Triton being the primary contributors.  I'd note that as we've moved through 2020, F-35 production volume began to plateau. This is consistent with the life cycle of AS' portion of the program and is a trend we expect to continue in 2021.  Turning to Defense Systems. Fourth quarter and full year sales increased 2% and 1%, respectively. Upward trends in both periods reflect higher volume on tactical missiles and subsystems, including GMLRS and AARGM-ER as well as certain restricted programs. Mission Systems' fourth quarter and full year sales rose 10% and 7%, respectively, with higher sales in all 4 business areas for both periods. In both the quarter and full year, we had sales growth in Airborne Sensors & Networks, reflecting higher volume for restricted activities, electronic warfare and F-35 programs. Navigation, Targeting & Survivability sales increased principally due to higher volume on targeting programs, including LITENING and self-protection programs. Cyber & Intelligence Mission Solutions sales increased primarily as a result of higher restricted volume. Maritime/Land Systems & Sensors sales increased primarily due to higher volume on land and marine systems. And finally, as Kathy touched on, Space Systems continued to deliver robust double-digit sales growth.  Sales increased 31% in the quarter and 18% for the year. Restricted programs, Next Gen OPIR, NASA's Artemis programs and GBSD had significantly higher volume in both periods. And in the fourth quarter, material purchases for the newly awarded extension missions for the commercial resupply service contract contributed to strong growth in our launch in strategic missile areas.  Turning to operating income on Slide 8. AS operating income increased by 10% in the quarter and 2% for the full year. The decline in fourth quarter and full year operating margin rate is primarily a function of the low margin on the equipment sale. Excluding that item, AS margin rate would have been 10.7% for the quarter and 10.2% for the year, higher than the guidance of approximately 10% that we gave last quarter.  Defense Systems operating income increased 22% in the fourth quarter and 7% for the full year. Operating margin rate was 11.2% for both periods, slightly above our guidance of approximately 11%.  Mission Systems fourth quarter operating income was slightly lower than the prior year period, which included a $20 million gain on a property sale. For the full year, operating income rose 4%. The Q4 MS operating margin rate was 14.2%. For the full year, its operating margin rate was 14.5%, consistent with our guidance and demonstrating solid execution across the Mission Systems portfolio.  Space Systems operating income increased 17% in Q4 and 12% for the full year. Operating margin rate decreased to 10.1% in the fourth quarter due in part to a higher percentage of early-stage development work than in the prior year period. For the full year, Space operating margin rate was 10.2%, in line with our guidance of the low 10%, in part reflecting a changing business mix, more leveraged to development work.  At the total company level, segment operating income increased 8% in Q4 and for the full year, it increased 5% to $4.2 billion with a margin rate of 11.4%. Excluding the equipment sales, segment operating margin rate for 2020 would have been at the high end of our guidance range of 11.3% to 11.5%. Total operating income for the full year increased to approximately $4.1 billion, with an operating margin rate of 11%.  Now turning to cash. We had a very strong fourth quarter, as is our typical pattern. For the year, cash from operations before the after-tax impact of the discretionary pension contribution was approximately $4.9 billion. As you saw in our press release, our adjusted free cash flow, which is before the pension contribution and includes the $205 million cash proceeds from the equipment sale, totaled approximately $3.7 billion. The equipment sale proceeds are included in adjusted free cash flow because they result from a customer transaction and serve as an offset to capital spending booked in prior periods.  In addition, it's important to note that we accelerated over $1.2 billion of payments to small and vulnerable suppliers during 2020, and we're continuing that program in 2021 to help our supply chain manage the ongoing impacts of COVID-19.  Now for an update on our pension plans, beginning on Slide 9. Our 2020 asset returns were approximately 16%, a second straight year of excellent performance, well above our expected long-term rate of return. Our FAS discount rate declined from 3.39% to 2.68%, which resulted in a mark-to-market charge of approximately $1 billion. But our net pension liability is lower than it was a year ago, and our funded ratio has increased to 86%, due in part to the $750 million discretionary contribution we made at the end of 2020. We have updated certain FAS pension plan assumptions including a reduction in our expected long-term rate of return from 8% to 7.5%.  Slide 10 summarizes our pension estimates for years 2021 through 2023, and Slide 11 summarizes sensitivities to changes to our 2021 assumptions. It's important to note that our discretionary pension contribution in December, along with strong recent asset returns, result in minimal cash pension contributions going forward, likely until 2025. Our CAS prepayment credit is approximately $1.9 billion as of January 1 this year.  Also on the CAS side, our updated assumptions as well as the outstanding asset performance have resulted in lower projected pension cost reimbursement over the next few years. In 2021, for example, CAS reimbursement of $465 million would be $362 million lower than 2020. This results in a modest 2021 revenue growth headwind of less than 1%, higher margin rate performance on certain fixed price programs and lower operating and free cash flow as less costs flows through our indirect rates. While this makes our rates more competitive to enable future growth, the net pension cost reduction, including both FAS and CAS, is a headwind of approximately $0.45 to 2021 EPS compared with 2020.  The other key factor affecting comparisons between our 2020 results and 2021 outlook is the divestiture of our IT services business. The IT services business generated approximately $2.3 billion of revenue in 2020, with a segment OM rate of 10.5%, which is below company average. The expected net after-tax proceeds from the transaction are approximately $2.5 billion. We expect to book a substantial gain on the sale, but neither that gain nor the cost directly associated with the transaction and our related debt retirement are included in our guidance.  Now looking ahead to 2021. Sector guidance is outlined on Slide 13. Our revenue and segment OM guidance are slightly above the outlook we provided in October, adjusting for the IT services divestiture. At Aeronautics Systems, we expect sales in the mid-to-high $11 billion range with a low 10% margin rate. Excluding the equipment sale from the 2020 results, AS revenue would be flat to up slightly year-over-year. For Manned Aircraft, restricted activities are expected to be lower, primarily due to the equipment sale in programs like FA-18, B-2 and commercial aerostructures are also expected to decline. Growth in manned programs, including E-2D, F-35 and JSTARS, is expected to partially offset these declines and as well as lower volume in Autonomous Systems.  For Defense Systems, we expect sales to be in the mid-to-high $5 billion range, reflecting the impact of the IT services divestiture. The effect of the Lake City program end is expected to be partially offset by growth elsewhere in the portfolio. We expect the operating margin rate to remain strong in the low 11% range.  Mission Systems sales will be reduced and operating margin rate will be increased by the IT services divestiture. As a result, we expect MS sales of approximately $10 billion with a margin rate of approximately 15%. Adjusting for the approximately $525 million of sales going to Veritas, 2021 MS guidance reflects mid single-digit organic growth.  At Space Systems, sales will be reduced and margin rate will be increased by the IT services divestiture. As a result, we expect low double-digit sales growth to the high $9 billion range, with margin rate of approximately 10%. This represents continued strong margin rate performance, given the expected change in mix. Space Systems sales and margin rate guidance contemplates more early phase development work, including GBSD and several restricted programs, which is accretive to sales and margin dollars but slightly dilutive to the margin rate of the portfolio.  Turning to Slide 14. Including the IT services divestiture, our total revenue guidance is $35.1 billion to $35.5 billion after intersegment eliminations of about $2 billion. We expect a full year segment operating margin rate of 11.5% to 11.7%. Adjusting for the IT services divestiture and the AS equipment sale, our organic growth rate would be nearly 4% at the midpoint of this guidance. I would also note that we expect the first quarter to be slightly less than 25% of full year revenue.  We expect 2021 total operating margin rate will range between 10.1% and 10.3%, reflecting $465 million for the operating portion of net FAS/CAS pension benefit, and unallocated corporate expense of approximately $550 million, which includes $260 million of noncash intangible asset amortization and PP&E step-up depreciation, and $290 million of other corporate unallocated items. Our guidance assumes $560 million of interest expense, de minimis interest income and an effective tax rate of approximately 17%.  I'll remind you that our 2020 reported effective tax rate reflected the mark-to-market expense. On an apples-to-apples basis with our 2021 guidance, the 2020 tax rate was about 15.8%. Our guidance also assumes the limited business impacts of COVID-19 are similar to the second half of 2020. Based on all of that, we expect adjusted earnings per share to range between $23.15 and $23.65, excluding the gain on the IT services sale and onetime transaction costs. As shown on Slide 16, this range reflects stronger segment performance than 2020, offset by the year 1 dilution of the IT services divestiture, the lower pension benefit and the higher tax rate. Given that we intend to use the majority of the proceeds from the IT services divestiture to buy back stock, our 2021 EPS outlook anticipates in a reduction -- a reduction in shares outstanding to approximately 162 million shares.  For 2021, we expect operating cash flow will range between $4.2 billion and $4.5 billion with adjusted free cash flow of $3 billion to $3.3 billion. Our estimate of adjusted free cash flow includes the remaining $239 million of proceeds from the equipment sale. As we've discussed on past calls, the payroll tax deferral resulting from the CARES Act is set to begin to unwind this year. The after-tax benefit was over $300 million in 2020 and should thus be an outflow of over $150 million in 2021. The IT services business generated approximately $250 million of free cash flow per year and the lower CAS reimbursement that I described a moment ago should create a year-over-year cash flow headwind of over $300 million. We intend to offset a portion of these headwinds through continued outstanding working capital performance.  As is our typical pattern, we expect our cash flows will be weighted more towards the second half of the year. As Kathy mentioned earlier, we're in an excellent position to deploy cash productively in 2021 and beyond. With about $5 billion in cash at the end of 2020 plus the IT services divestiture proceeds of approximately $2.5 billion after the divestiture closes, we intend to deploy more than $3 billion to share repurchases and over $2 billion to debt retirement in 2021, subject to market conditions and timing considerations.  Our current guidance presumes the retirement of the $700 million of debt that matures in March and the early retirement of the $1.5 billion of debt scheduled to mature in 2022. Our 2020 and 2021 debt retirements, combined with the $750 million pension prefunding, total $4 billion towards the strengthening of our balance sheet and support our target of returning to a solid investment-grade rating of BBB+. Beyond 2021, our discretionary cash can be prioritized towards shareholder returns or M&A, while also maintaining a very strong balance sheet.  In summary, we expect to continue strong value creation through a combination of growth, performance and robust cash generation as well as thoughtful capital allocation.  Now I think we're ready for Q&A, Todd.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question is from Seth Seifman of JPMorgan.
Seth Seifman: I wondered just with the divestiture, is the long-term plan to sort of maintain Defense and Mission as kind of 2 separate segments? And how would we kind of think about the long-term growth prospects in Defense given that you've got IBCS and AARGM in that segment?
Kathy Warden: Thanks, Seth. So when we look at the portfolio of Defense Systems, as you point out, it is consisting of our command and control as well as our offensive and missile systems capabilities. And so we view that area as one that will continue to grow. It's very well aligned with our customers' highest priority areas, both domestically and internationally. And we have made the portfolio decision we have to divest our IT services business so that we could focus more fully on those businesses in our Defense portfolio.  On the other hand, Mission Systems, which contains a significant quantity of open architecture, networking capabilities that are really keeping pace with the advancing threat environment to be able to help our customers compete in the electromagnetic spectrum, those capabilities are also areas that we see well aligned and core to growth. So we want to keep that team focused on investing and staying at the forefront of technology to different areas of focus. But certainly some synergy and those two teams work well together, but I don't see need for a different alignment to make that kind of working relationship productive.
Operator: Your next question is from Carter Copeland of Melius Research.
Carter Copeland: Dave, I wondered if you could just expand a little bit on this AS equipment sale, how should we think about the accounting treatment of that? Is that something that you just sort of book and shift in a quarter? Or is it cost on cost? Or do you recognize the revenue when you make the sale? I'm just trying to think about the cost of whatever that was and how we should think about that. Just any clarity on that would be helpful.
David Keffer: Sure. Thanks, Carter. It's -- as we mentioned, relates to a restricted program. So there's a limited amount we can say about that. What I would be able to say is this is equipment that, as we mentioned, was booked in the past as capital expenditure. We've now sold that equipment to a customer. And as appropriate, both revenue and the portion of the cash that we've received in the quarter, in our 2020 results, little over half of the cash is to be paid in 2021 and will be booked in as part of our cash flow in the 2021 outlook.  From an accounting perspective, it's a somewhat unique item, but a customer transaction and with revenue accordingly, as we mentioned, minimal profit associated with it, which is why you see the margin impact on AS and the outstanding growth that it delivered in the quarter.
Operator: Your next question is from Sheila Kahyaoglu of Jefferies.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Maybe, Kathy, for you, just bigger picture, Northrop is one of the only primes where consensus doesn't have any major margin improvement baked in. How do you think about your profit profile of your business, given at least 20% is in development or low rate production? Can you give us a little bit more color? Do you see profit rates improving over the next few years?
Kathy Warden: Thanks, Sheila. We clearly, this year, have guided some margin rate expansion and there are a number of factors contributing to that. First and foremost is the strong performance in the operating businesses that we delivered both in 2020 and that we anticipate in 2021. That will continue to be a focus for the company. We also have been increasingly orienting our business to agility and streamlining and COVID-19 helped to accelerate some of those initiatives in 2020, again, resulting in good rate management and cost reduction. And those operating efficiencies, we expect to continue as we move forward as well.  And then finally, as you note, we do have mix headwinds as we bring in more early phase development work. Of course, those are generating increasing margin dollars but create pressure on margin rate. And we've challenged the team to look at offsets to that mix pressure through just strong performance, operating efficiencies and future changes that we might make in the operating structure that enable us to continue to find new ways of reducing cost.  So those are the areas that we are aligned to. And as you see in our guide, we were, in 2021, able to, across the portfolio, really offset many of those margin headwinds that we see.
Operator: Your next question is from David Strauss of Barclays.
David Strauss: Dave, wanted to ask about free cash flow. I appreciate all the moving pieces there. But it looks like when I net out the pension side, divestiture side, tax, everything, you're about in the same place as you ended 2020, around $3 billion, but that included a fair amount of working capital -- positive working capital in 2020. So are you assuming positive working capital again in 2021 or contribution from working capital in '21? And how sustainable is that looking beyond '21?
David Keffer: Sure. Happy to talk through that. I think you named the right kind of nonoperating or unique drivers from '20 to '21, free cash flow, the divestiture, the CAS pension headwind and then the reversal of the payroll tax benefit from 2020. And you're right that when you add those 3 together, it's greater than the reduction in our outlook from 2020 to 2021. So it does require us to make continued working capital improvements in 2021.  The good news there is we believe we're on track to do so. We expect to continue to be able to generate working capital improvements really across our businesses. We have some targeted areas of performance improvement that we're driving in 2021. And we'll -- this is not a point in time effort. This is a long-term effort that will remain a focus of the company. So to your question about years thereafter, we will continue to drive efforts around working capital efficiency in '22 and beyond.
Operator: Your next question is from Jon Raviv of Citi.
Jon Raviv: Similar question, just sort of thinking forward about organic growth when you did 9% in 2020. You're talking about 4% in 2021. And there are some moving pieces there with the equipment sale, I think. But just this idea of sustaining growth, given where your backlog has been, given where your bookings have been, on whether there's an opportunity to actually accelerate as things like B-21, GBSD, AARGM, ICBS, all kind of start to hit their stride?
Kathy Warden: Thanks, Jon. So as we look at growth this year in 2021 and beyond, we see the opportunity for continued growth based not only on our backlog but also new programs. I outlined some of those in my earlier comments that we see being awarded this year. As budgets appear to be flattening out, our portfolio would have the opportunity for sustained growth through programs like GBSD, which is at the early stage of its ramp, as well as a number of our restricted programs.  It very much will be determined on what funding priorities come from the new administration and how those might play out over time. But we can clearly see forward this year and are projecting another strong year of growth in 2021, and based on the strong support for our programs in the 2021 budget, are equally optimistic that we have a path to growth beyond this year.
Operator: Your next question is from Cai von Rumohr of Cowen.  We'll go to our next question from Kristine Liwag of Morgan Stanley.
Kristine Liwag: Kathy, can you provide more color on your framework of how you think about sustainability? With your planned divestiture of the testing business for cluster munitions, where do you draw the line? And do you anticipate more divestitures from this initiative?
Kathy Warden: So Kristine, when we look through the lens of sustainability at our portfolio, we look at not only what capability we're providing, but how it's being used or how we expect the customer to use that capability going forward. And the decision in this case, with our small contract related to cluster munitions, it was a surveillance program. It was actually structured to help remove cluster munition safely.  However, we recognize that even supporting area like cluster munitions for investors is of concern because safe removal implies that at one point, there was an embracing of the use of these products. And so when we look at our portfolio, we are going to continue to recognize. We support our government and our allies in the important work of enabling our troops to do their work. But at the same time, be thoughtful about potential human rights implications and how these technologies may be used in the future and provide equal consideration to safeguards associated with them.  In answer to your question, I don't expect there to be significant change in our portfolio as a result. We already have a portfolio where we have looked through that lens and making decisions about where we invest and what work we undertake. This was just one small contract that came to us through the acquisition, and we've made a decision to stop performing in that area.
Operator: Your next question is from Ron Epstein of Bank of America.
Ronald Epstein: Kathy, could you speak to the B-2 defensive management system? And is that nearing completion? I mean, how -- where does that program stand in the big picture vis-à-vis B-21 starting to ramp up a little bit? How should we think about that?
Kathy Warden: Well, taking a step back from the defensive management system, which is completing this year. We are looking at modernization of the B-2 so that it can stay in service through the successful transition and replacement of B-21, which, as you know, doesn't happen and it doesn't start to happen until later in the decade. And so B-2 modernization as a broader program will continue, but the DMS program is one that is expected to complete this year.
Operator: Your next question is from Myles Walton of UBS.
Myles Walton: Kathy, I was wondering, competition is always changing and there's new competitors entering all the time. But I'm curious with the confluence between Palantir now at $70 billion and an administration geared towards inserting new technology, commercial-based companies into the landscape of competition. Is it evolving quickly? Or is the market just thinking it's evolving quickly in terms of the competitive landscape?
Kathy Warden: We certainly see new entrants coming into the space. And in the case Palantir, they've been in the space for a number of years. And we are, in many instances, working with those companies. Because a company like Northrop Grumman brings scale. We bring understanding and mission. We bring technology in our own right in areas like artificial intelligence, machine learning. We have a business that is bigger than many of the smaller companies already embedded inside of our company in these areas. But there also is opportunity to partner and learn because the technology is moving so rapidly. And it's what's creating these new market entrants. There's room for more players in the industrial base and good ideas to build upon one another.  So the partnering strategy that we have works to embrace those small companies and bring them into an ecosystem along with us to solve our customers' problems at scale. I've talked in the past about pitch days that we've been doing in certain areas. We've done artificial intelligence. We've done autonomy, to name a few. And we have hundreds of companies that are participating in these engagements with us to talk about how we might together solve our customers' hardest problems.
Operator: Your next question is from Doug Harned of Bernstein.
Doug Harned: We've seen kind of history on -- recent history in government IT where scale has been very important. We saw it with Leidos. We've seen it with GDIT. When you made the decision to make the sale of some of your IT businesses to Peraton, can you talk about how you're thinking about this in terms of scale? It appears that you didn't really sell any national security-related capabilities. But how do you do the trade off? I know you know this business really well. So how do you think about the focus going forward in government IT?
Kathy Warden: The business that we divested does have national security work, Doug. It's across a broad spectrum of customers, including federal civilian as well as Department of Defense and intelligence community. And we packaged our IT services business together, as you note, across 3 different businesses because this is an area that we are going to be less focused on and we wanted to get that business into the hands of an organization that wants to invest and to build scale. And I agree with your assertion that in the IT services business, scale is an advantage. And Veritas has the vision that you see playing out even most recently with their announcement to acquire Perspecta and put all of these businesses together. So we are confident that they are the right owner for this business, that they have a vision for it, that they have a commitment to invest and that they will be a good employer for our employees who will transition.
Operator: Your next question is from Robert Stallard of Vertical Research.
Robert Stallard: Kathy, quick question for you. The administration seems to have put the Middle East arm sales on whole for now. I was wondering if there could be any implications for you, particularly if you have any exposure on the offensive side?
Kathy Warden: We have a small piece of work that was in consideration, had not yet been approved. And so it is not work that was approved and is put on hold, as you've read about the F-35, for instance. What we do anticipate is an extensive evaluation of everything that was in the pipeline, which will include some of our work. And of course, as you well know, we're embedded in the F-35 as well, but I'm talking about some of the arm sales that we would have been prime on and that are particularly related to our weapons business, which was the genesis of your question. It was small. It was related to AARGM, and it is something that does not have a material impact on our plans. But we do expect that those will all be reviewed. And we, along with you, will learn what this administration's view on those exports will be.
Operator: Our next question is from Robert Spingarn of Crédit Suisse.
Robert Spingarn: Kathy, I'm hoping I can ask on this because the Air Force already talked about it. But on B-21, Will Roper, the outgoing Air Force acquisition chief, made some pretty positive comments recently with respect to first flight, indicating that even though it's now going to be mid-'22, it's going to be of a production-ready aircraft rather than a prototype and then you can move pretty quickly into low rate and then full production. Since that's out there, I wanted to see if you could talk about the margin profile and the margin opportunity here, given that this aircraft is so far along.
Kathy Warden: So I can't speak specifically about the margin profile or the specific time line of transition from one phase to another. But what you picked up on from Dr. Roper and there was also a piece that was based on an interview with Randy Walden on the B-21 is the confidence that the customer has in the development progress and the ability to manufacture this aircraft and have a capability at first flight that is more mature than previous aircraft development programs.  And we're doing that through a number of ways, the digital engineering and the digital thread that we have on the program. The testing of hardware and software on a surrogate test bed and the thinking about maintaining and manufacturing in the early phases of design as well as the interface with the end user. The pilots who will fly this aircraft have all helped to really mature the production-ready articles that will be tested in those initial phases and should significantly reduce rework, which is, in itself, schedule, certainty and reduced cost. So that's what we expect based on the progress that we're making at this point, and it's what's underlying the confidence that those customers are expressing.
Operator: Your next question is from Peter Arment of Baird.
Peter Arment: Kathy, maybe just a question on kind of the CapEx profile you expect over not only this year, but next, I mean, CapEx was up 12% in absolute dollars and 2020. And also, your internal R&D dollars were up 13% on an absolute basis. How should we think about both of those? And just in the context of all the program wins that you've had and just the success on the overall portfolio?
David Keffer: Sure. Peter, it's Dave. I'll address that one. As you mentioned, the 2020 CapEx figure was around $1.4 billion and that's a comparable level to what we've projected into 2021, the netting effect then being the equipment sale we talked about earlier, which also flows through that investing section. So on a net basis, it's actually a bit below our prior guidance for '20 and '21.  Beyond '21, the trend that we've talked about over time remains our intention. Where the CapEx as a percentage of revenue should decline, we see opportunities to continue making prudent investments in our business and our capabilities and technologies but at a slightly lower level of overall investment than has been required over the last few years and into 2021. So no change to that long-term approach.  The same would apply on the R&D side. We've had -- we've been investing amply in the business, close to 3% of revenue over the recent past and into the near future and we'll continue to invest in those differentiating technologies and capabilities.
Operator: Your next question is from George Shapiro of Shapiro Research.
George Shapiro: Yes. I wanted to know, is the GBSD supposed to add about $1 billion of revenues this year, Kathy, like you had suggested on the Q3 call?
Kathy Warden: So George, we have said nearly $1 billion. It's a little less, I would think, more in the $800 million to $900 million of incremental revenue.
Operator: Our next question is from Hunter Keay of Wolfe Research.
Michael Maugeri: It's actually Mike Maugeri on for Hunter. Dave, you mentioned mid single-digit organic growth at Mission Systems. So within that organic portion, what are just some of the bigger moving pieces embedded in that guide?
David Keffer: Sure. I'll be happy to kick that one off and Kathy may want to jump in as well. The MS portfolio, as we've talked about over time, is difficult to pin down to any 1 or 2 key drivers in a given year. Like most years, we have a lot of programs with opportunities for growth across the MS portfolio. Certainly, the radar capabilities, targeting capabilities, the cybersecurity capabilities are key growth areas there. We've talked about a couple of the key potential new business opportunities like 3DELRR and others in the MS portfolio. So a nice breadth of opportunities across MS, similar to 2020 when we had growth across all 4 of its business areas. So absent the divestiture in '21, another solid year projected ahead. Kathy, anything you would add to that or on the MS portfolio?
Kathy Warden: That's a good summary.
David Keffer: Okay.
Operator: Your next question is a follow-up from Jon Raviv of Citi.
Jon Raviv: So just following on the sales question that I had. Any headwinds to watch out for? I know there's, for example, a distributed aperture system cut over at some point in F-35. But just sort of anything else that we should just be cognizant of going forward?
David Keffer: So I can talk a bit about that. We mentioned the approximately 4% organic growth figure when you remove the divestiture as you compared 2020 to 2021. So 4% organic growth, that's even with the CAS pension headwind that we mentioned earlier, which is just under 1%. That also includes the impact of Lake City, which is just over 1% of revenue as it came to a strong conclusion in 2020.  Those are the two most significant items, and I wouldn't call your attention to any one particular area of recompete exposure looking forward, either in aggregate. We feel really good about the program backlog and don't have anything approaching that 1% headwind level other than those that we've mentioned.
Todd Ernst: We have time for one more question.
Operator: We had Cai von Rumohr of Cowen return to the queue.
Cai von Rumohr: Yes. So a great year in bookings in 2020. If we adjust your year-end '20 backlog to exclude the Northrop IT business that you're selling, do you look for backlog growth in 2021? And what are the key drivers there? What are the end new program competitions that could add to that backlog?
Kathy Warden: So Cai, we do expect to have book-to-bill around 1 again in 2021, and that is through some new awards like NGI, 3DELRR. It also includes bookings on key programs like F-35, the next block buy, so it's spread across the portfolio in each of our sectors. We expect to have solid awards in 2021. All right. So thank you for hanging with us. We tried to get through as many of your questions as possible, given how much we had to cover today.  Again, I want to thank the Northrop Grumman team for another outstanding year. We performed extremely well in the midst of many challenges last year, and we're well positioned for 2021 and beyond due to that strong performance, our continued backlog growth and the value-creating portfolio actions that we've been taking. With our cash on hand and strong cash flows, we're committed to thoughtful deployment of that capital to create long-term value for our shareholders.  Thank you, all, for being with us today, and that concludes our call.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-10-22 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Northrop Grumman’s Third Quarter 2020 Conference Call. Today’s call is being recorded. My name is Natalia, and I’ll be your operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Todd Ernst, Treasurer and Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Ernst, please proceed.
Todd Ernst: Thank you, Natalia. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Northrop Grumman’s third quarter 2020 conference call. This morning, we’ll refer to a PowerPoint presentation that is posted on our website. Before we start, matters discussed on today’s call, including 2020 guidance and remarks regarding 2021 and beyond reflect the company’s judgment based on information available at the time of this call. They constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to safe harbor provisions of federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which are noted in today’s press release and our SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties may cause actual company results to differ materially. Today’s call will include non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to our GAAP financial results in our earnings release. On the call today are Kathy Warden, our Chairman, CEO and President; and Dave Keffer, our CFO. At this time, I’d like to turn the call over to Kathy. Kathy?
Kathy Warden: Thank you, Todd. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We hope you and your families are well. As you all know, we continue to operate in the midst of a global pandemic. Our focus remains on the safety and wellbeing of our people, delivering on our customer commitments and supporting our suppliers and communities. As the pandemic continue, we are operating under protocols that we instituted earlier in the year to help preserve the wellbeing of our employees. And these are helping us to meet our commitments to customers and deliver strong operating results, while also continuing to strengthen our foundation for the future. In addition to COVID-19, we have experienced locally devastating natural disasters at summer. I especially want to recognize our Northrop Grumman employees in Lake Charles, Louisiana, who have persevered through two hurricanes in the last two months. Despite experiencing personal loss, they have returned to work and continue to support the U.S. Air Force through sustainment of JSTARS aircraft. Their resiliency embodies the spirit of Northrop Grumman employees everywhere. Also, before I discuss this quarter’s results, I want to take this opportunity to thank Janis Pamiljans, who is retiring as President of Aeronautics System. In his more than 34 years with Northrop Grumman, he has made significant contributions to the business, through his leadership and unwavering commitment to our employees and customers. And I want to congratulate Tom Jones, who will succeed Janis on January 1. Tom currently leads Airborne Sensors & Networks in Mission Systems. This business delivers large scale, mission critical C4ISR system and complex hardware and software products for airborne platforms, including many in aeronautics. Tom is a seasoned executive with 30 years of aerospace and defense experience, and we’re fortunate he will be leading our Aeronautics business as it continues to deliver critical national security solution. Now focusing on our third quarter results, I want to thank our employees for their dedication to delivery for our customers and shareholders. We had a strong third quarter, and based on year-to-date results, we are raising our guidance for the year. Our sales grew 7% on the quarter and 6% year-to-date, driven by sales growth at Space, Mission Systems and Aeronautics. Space continues to be our most robust growth driver with sales increasing 17% in the third quarter and 13% year-to-date, and Mission Systems with our second fastest growing sector. Strong performance from all of our sectors generated segment operating income growth of 10% in the quarter and 4% year-to-date, and we delivered an 11.5% segment operating margin rate in both periods. Earnings per share grew 7% in the third quarter and 9% year-to-date. Third quarter free cash flow increased 22% to $1.1 billion, after capital spending of $287 million. Year-to-date, free cash flow has increased 80% to $1.9 billion, reflecting solid operational performance, as well as the benefit of customer actions to support the industrial base. Our new business awards are again a highlight. Third quarter bookings totaled more than $20 billion or 2.2 times sales, and year-to-date we’ve captured $43 billion and do business, which brings our year-to-date book-to-bill to 1.6. As of the end of the quarter, our total backlog stood at more than $81 million, a 25% increase from year end and a new record for Northrop Grumman. This year’s new awards demonstrate our portfolio’s alignment with the nation’s highest priority global security mission, including space, nuclear deterrence, advanced weapons, electronic warfare, and all domain command and control. Turning to sector highlights, I’ll begin with Space. In early September, the air force awarded Northrop Grumman, a $13.3 billion contract for the engineering and manufacturing development phase of the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent. I want to congratulate the members of our nationwide team for their exceptional work on this program. This next phase of our nation’s program to replace the Minuteman III ICBM, which were first fielded in 1970, culminate more than 10 years of planning across two presidential administration, as well as a series of competition. The EMD award includes weapon system design, qualification, tested evaluation and nuclear certification, and we expect it works for the production phases of the program. Now that the EMD phase has been awarded, GBSD ramped quickly. For 2021, we expect GBSD to contribute nearly $1 billion of incremental growth at Space Systems. Our nationwide team looks forward to delivering a secure, reliable and effective nuclear deterrent capability to our nation. An award of this size impacts business mix by increasing cost type development work as a percent of sale, particularly at Space and to a lesser extent the entire company. While we expect this mix shift will pressure next year’s margin rate at Space, we will work to offset those pressure across the company through program performance and cost management. In addition to GBSD, they also captured one of three evolved strategic Satcom or ESS award to rapidly prototype a strategic communications payload with enhanced resilience and cybersecurity capabilities. ESS will be designed to seamlessly interoperate with and eventually replace the Advanced Extremely High Frequency system. This effort is critical to extending our nation’s secure satellite communications infrastructure and we expect will represent a multibillion dollar competitive opportunity. Program milestones achieved in Space with the quarter included the successful tests of the Space Launch System booster for NASA’s Artemis program and the MEV-2 launch in August. And shortly after the end of the third quarter, our Cygnus spacecraft was launched; awarded an entire rocket to complete our 14th resupply mission to the International Space Station. At the Aeronautics sector, in addition to higher restricted volume, F-35 deliveries to recover to first quarter level. Through the end of the third quarter, we’ve now delivered 719 F-35 center fuselage units and we are continuing to manufacture at a pace that supports our scheduled delivery. On the E-2D program, we’ve now delivered 44 of the 75 aircraft under contract. The U.S. Navy has been approved 11 plane increase to that program of record and it’s now working to identify funding for this additional aircraft. I would also note that international opportunities for E-2D continue to be promising. In addition to Japan’s 13 E-2Ds, France and Taiwan are expected to procure E-2Ds in the coming years. In Autonomous Systems, Triton’s inaugural deployment to Guam occurred in January, and led to an early operational decision by the Navy in May. Following these critical milestone, Triton is quickly becoming an invaluable asset in the Seventh Fleet Maritime Patrol and Reconnaissance Command. Despite the likely budget pressure on our health portfolio beyond this year, we have a promising set of future autonomous opportunities, including Skyborg and the MQ-9 replacement among others. Turning to Defense Systems. In the third quarter, the U.S. Army conducted live fire tests of our IBCS system and successfully engaged multiple targets. These exercises conducted as part of the IBCS limited user test, demonstrated our system’s ability to maintain continuous track of the targets despite contested environment conditions by fusing data from multiple sensors. A successful test for the ability to share data across platforms and sensors are significant demonstration of our underlying architecture, which is applicable to join all domain operations and increases the value and power of our customers’ legacy platform and weapon system. DS also completed the first environmental test of AARGM-ER’s new extended range rocket motor, a major milestone toward motor qualification and first live fire flight test in 2021. And in hypersonics, we successfully completed captive carry test in support of the DARPA and U.S. Air Force Hawk program. With our prime contractor, we are on track to proceed to free flight testing, and we are now establishing manufacturing plans to meet initial low rate production quantity. And finally Mission Systems. We continue to meet or exceed prior year deliveries for the F-35 program. In the third quarter, MS delivered 41 radars consistent with 2019 quantities and delivered 47 GaAs chipsets and 50 CNI chipsets, year-over-year increases of 30% and 40%, respectively. Mission Systems also received a task order contract valued at $690 million for the Defense Intelligence Agency’s TALOS system. This effort focuses on the build of new big data systems for the DIA, including MARS, the Machine-assisted Rapid-repository System, transforming current databases into multidimensional, flexible and rigorous data environments. MARS is expected to create a military intelligence environment accessible for up-to-date information by the intelligence community and warfighters. And DARPA awarded MS a contract for its Gamebreaker program. This innovative program seeks to develop and apply artificial intelligence to existing real-time strategy game. The Gamebreaker effort gives us an opportunity to evaluate and develop artificial intelligence technology to improve flexible planning, optimization, and discovery and products that operate dynamic environments. Looking ahead, we believe our customers will require integrated artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities in the same way as cyber resiliency is now broadly required in products and systems, and Northrop Grumman is well positioned to support its emerging customer requirements. We’re extremely proud of our team’s results for the third quarter and year-to-date. And I want to recognize the rebound and productivity our workforce has demonstrated since late March and early April. As we look ahead to the remainder of the year, our guidance assumes that our team’s productivity, as well as the operations of our customers and suppliers, remain at or near current levels. It also reflects the strength of year-to-date results and our expectations for a strong fourth quarter. Based on our current assumptions, we now expect 2020 sales of $35.7 billion to $36 billion, which is 6% top line growth at the midpoint. EPS should grow to between $22.25 and $22.65, which is also 6% growth at the midpoint. And we now expect free cash flow to increase to between $3.3 billion and $3.6 billion, a 14% increase over 2019 at the midpoint. Regarding capital deployment, we continue to focus on a balanced strategy that calls for robust investment, strengthening of the balance sheet through debt reduction and funding of our pension plan and returning cash to shareholders, which we will do by resuming share repurchases and maintaining a competitive dividend. We believe our strong cash flow and current cash balances will allow us to address all of these value creating deployment opportunities. Turning to the U.S. budget environment, we expect to see continued strong bipartisan support for national security in the future. As indicated by the $740 billion targeted for FY 2021 appropriation. We are pleased that Congress and the administration agreed to a continuing resolution that funds the government through December 11, and avoids disruption in the execution of critical national security missions. And I will note that funding under continuing resolutions supports our programs, including GBSD even if the continuing resolution is extended into early next year. We continue to believe that bipartisan support for defense spending will endure and that our portfolio is well-aligned to support our national defense strategy. While we plan for various budget scenarios, defense spending is largely threat driven and today’s threat environment warrants a strong defense. Emerging threats are intensifying, and we believe both political parties are committed to effectively countering these threats. While there are many external uncertainties, Northrop Grumman has a strengthening foundation for growth and the capabilities and people necessary to address our nation’s most challenging problem. We are investing for the future, delivering value to our shareholders and meeting our commitments to our customers, and all of our stakeholders. So now I’ll turn it over to Dave to provide more detail on our sector’s results, 2020 guidance updates, as well as a preview of certain trends in 2021. Dave?
Dave Keffer: Thanks, Kathy and good morning everyone. I’d also like to thank our employees for their strong performance in this quarter. My comments begin with the third quarter highlights on Slide 3. We delivered excellent bookings, sales, operating income, EPS and cash. And we’re pleased to be increasing our 2020 guidance for sales, EPS, and free cash flow with the assumptions that Kathy articulated. Slide 4 provides a bridge between third quarter 2020 and third quarter 2019 earnings per share. Higher sales and segment operating income drove $0.51 of the increase. Net pension contributed $0.40. These positives were partially offset by a higher corporate unallocated, which was primarily driven by a $50 million increase in state taxes, as well as higher net interest expense, federal income taxes and other items. I would also note that COVID-19 related expenses are reflected in our current results. I’ll begin a review of sector results on Slide 5. Aeronautics sales rose 5% for the quarter and 4% year-to-date. Sales in Autonomous Systems and Manned Aircraft were higher in both periods, for the quarter and year-to-date restricted activities and the E-2D contributed to sales growth and for the quarter F-35 volume was also higher. Defense System sales decreased 4% in Q3 and year-to-date sales are comparable to last year. Third quarter trends included lower volume for Mission Readiness as the Hunter UAV sustainment program nears completion. And in Battle Management & Missile Systems, third quarter sales reflect lower volume at Lake City and on an international weapons program as both of those activities neared completion. Declines in these areas were partially offset by higher volume on GMLRS and AARGM. Year-to-date results reflect similar program trends. Mission Systems sales were up 10% in the third quarter and 6% year-to-date. All four MS business areas contributed to this quarter’s sales growth. Third quarter results reflects higher airborne radar volume for the MESA and F-35 programs, higher volume on self self-protection and targeting system, and higher volume on marine systems and G/ATOR. Year-to-date sales growth reflects higher volume for airborne radars, marine systems, restricted programs and self-protection, avionics and targeting programs. Space Systems sales rose 17% in the third quarter and 13% year-to-date, due to higher volume in both business areas, higher volume on restricted programs and other space programs like next generation OPIR and NASA Artemis contributed to higher sales in both periods. Stronger volume on launch vehicle and hypersonics programs drove higher launch in strategic missile sales in both periods. Now turning to segment operating income on Slide 6. Aeronautics operating income increased 9% and margin rate increased to 10.1%. Year-to-date AS margin rate is 10%, in both periods AS recorded lower net EAC adjustments. In the third quarter, lower positive EACs were more than offset by favorable overhead rate performance and year-to-date results were helped by the second quarter $21 million government accounting benefit. At Defense Systems operating income increased by 8% in the quarter and 2% year-to-date. Operating margin rate increased 130 basis points in the quarter to 11.7% and 20 basis points year-to-date. Margin rate expansion in both periods is due to improved performance in Battle Management & Missile Systems programs. Operating income at Mission Systems rose 5% in the quarter and 6% year-to-date. Third quarter operating margin was 14.5% and year-to-date margin rate was comparable to the prior year at 14.6%. Space Systems operating income rose 17% in the quarter and 11% year-to-date. Third quarter operating margin rate improved to 10.2% and year-to-date operating margin rates declined slightly to 10.3%, principally due to lower net EAC adjustments. Turning to Slide 7, we’ve updated guidance at all four sectors based on our current assumptions and better than expected year-to-date results. At AS, we now expect sales to grow to the middle $11 billion range, with some potential upside related to additional lower margin sales that may be booked in the fourth quarter. For Defense Systems, we are increasing margin rate to approximately 11%. We’re also increasing our margin rate guidance for Mission Systems. We now expect a mid-14% margin rate this year at MS. And at Space, based on the increase in development work at the sector, we expect sales will increase to the mid $8 billion range with a low 10% margin rate for the year. Moving to consolidated guidance on Slide 8. We’re raising 2020 sales, adjusted EPS and free cash flow guidance to reflect the strength of year-to-date results, 2020 sales are now expected to range between $35.7 billion and $36 billion, a $400 million increase over prior guidance, with top line growth of 6% at the midpoint. We’ve also increased our total net FAS/CAS pension adjustment by $25 million, in part to reflect the updated demographics study that we complete in the third quarter of each year. No change to our expected federal tax rate or year-end weighted average share count. Based on year-to-date results and expectations for the remainder of the year, we’re increasing mark-to-market adjusted EPS to a range of $22.25 to $22.65. For free cash flow, we now expect between $3.3 billion and $3.6 billion for the year or about $20 per share at the midpoint. Slide 9 provides a bridge between July’s guidance and today’s full-year EPS outlook. The increase in guidance reflects $0.25 of third quarter operational improvement. Regarding capital deployment, capital expenditures year-to-date totaled $828 million and as we indicated we retired $1 billion in debt that matured on October 15. As we look ahead to next year on Slide 10, we expect three of our four sectors, Space, Mission Systems and Defense Systems to have top-line trends consistent with 2020. Space should continue low-to-mid teen percent top line growth, supported by a backlog that has more than double this year due to GBSD and robust restricted awards. Mission Systems should generate mid-single digit sales growth, including higher volume from restricted and airborne, and ground radar programs. Defense Systems top line growth will be impacted by the Lake City wind down, which will be a headwind of approximately $400 million in next year. This is a little more than we originally anticipated and reflects the fact that we had more than – more sales than expected in 2020 as we transition these activities over to the new contractor. We expect DS 2021 sales to be comparable to this year. Regarding Aeronautics Systems, we expect several factors will lead to a deceleration from this year’s mid-single-digit growth. In 2021, we believe COVID-19 will continue to impact our commercial programs. F-35 production will begin to plateau and our HALE portfolio will likely experience defense budget funding pressures. These factors lead us to an expectation of low-single digit growth at Aeronautics in 2021 from the mid $11 billion range this year. Given these sector trends, we expect 2021 sales at the company level will be in the low-to-mid $37 billion range, which includes intercompany eliminations of approximately $2 billion. Looking at segment margin trends GBSD will pressure the margin rate at Space, but we expect margin rate performance from the other three businesses will be generally consistent with 2020. As Kathy said, we have opportunities to offset mixed pressure at Space Systems through program performance and cost reductions across the company. We will aggressively drive to capture these opportunities. We do continue to expect higher segment margin dollars in 2021, and we expect next year’s segment margin rate will likely trend toward the low-end of the 2020 guidance range of 11.3% to 11.5%. Our outlook assumes current productivity levels. And although we’re actively pursuing the recovery of COVID related costs, our outlook does not include significant recoveries. Turning to cash, we continue to expect strong cash flow. There will be a 2021 headwind related to the reversal of about half of this year’s $300 million to $400 million deferred payroll tax related benefit, but we expect to have opportunities to offset that with improvements in working capital. Our 2021 capital expenditures are expected to be about $1.35 billion. Regarding 2021 pension items, I would note that in addition to updates for changes in the discount rate at the end of this year and actual 2020 planned asset returns, we’re evaluating our pension assumptions, including our long-term expected rate of return, which is currently 8%. For your modeling purposes, we believe the net effect of these and other pension updates effective 12/31 is likely to lower our annual net FAS/CAS pension adjustment by approximately $150 million to $250 million in both 2021 and 2022 versus estimates of $1.75 billion and $1.8 billion respectively, which we provided on January 30. We will provide our detailed outlook on pension items on our fourth quarter call in January. As discussed more fully in our earnings release and our SEC filings, our guidance for 2020 and our outlook for 2021 assume no significant changes to our productivity, to support for our programs or to the federal corporate tax rate. In addition, our guidance and outlook do not reflect any potential discretionary pension plan contributions that we may choose to make in either year. In closing, we’re very pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date results, particularly new awards and our record backlog. Overall, our portfolio is well-aligned with evolving customer priorities. We continue to execute to deliver value for our shareholders and we continue to invest in the future. With that Todd, I think we’re ready to open the call up for Q&A.
Todd Ernst: Natalia, please remind everyone how to get in the queue and ask questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Research.
Robert Stallard: Thank you so much. Good morning.
Kathy Warden: Good morning.
Robert Stallard: And thanks for all the detail there on the 2021. But Kathy, just on another topic, on GBSD, I was wondering if you could comment about how confident you are about this program staying on track because there has been some commentary, it could be at risk or the change of administration and a tougher budget environment. And in relation to that, as the program progresses, do you think 2021 will be this trough year for space margins? Thank you.
Kathy Warden: Thanks, Rob. Every new administration has conducted an analysis of the triad and we expect that to happen again if after the election or working with the new administration. But I’ll also note that each have reaffirmed. It has a critical role to play in our national security. Since 1994, the DoD has had a formal Nuclear Posture Review process. And in that they evaluate the nation’s strategic deterrent posture and have validated all three legs of the triad as being critically important. And I’ll note that the two most recent Nuclear Posture Reviews, one which was in 2010, was conducted by the Obama-Biden administration. And of course the one in 2018 was conducted by the Trump-Pence administration. But again, both confirmed the need for the triad to include GBSD and the B-21. And historically, if we look back, when defense spending declined and conventional military forces come under budget pressure, the U.S. and the allies have relied even more heavily upon nuclear deterrence to ensure global stability. So we think that this triad is going to be viewed as even more important from a budgetary priority perspective if those conditions exist. So we’re confident that a new administration would recognize that value and continue to support the modernization efforts that are well underway for both GBSD and B-21.
Operator: Your next question from the line of…
Kathy Warden: Natalia, just before we move on, you had a second part to the question, Rob. So let me address that quickly. You asked about space margins and weather 2021 would be the trough given the mixed pressure that we will have from the GBSD program. I’ll remind you that we’re expecting nearly $1 billion of incremental growth from GBSD next year, but we also expect significant growth going from 2021 into 2022, so that mixed pressure will persist. But as Dave noted in his commentary, we are working to offset that pressure at the company level with strong costs reduction and program performance. And Natalia, now we’re ready for the next question. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Carter Copeland with Melius Research.
Carter Copeland: Hey, good morning, everyone.
Kathy Warden: Good morning, Carter.
Carter Copeland: Kathy, I wonder if you could talk about what you expect in terms of backlog growth opportunities in 2021, given that 2019 and 2020 were so strong with some big lumpy awards. Do you think you can still grow backlog next year? Or is that going to be tougher, given the compares? Thanks.
Kathy Warden: We certainly see the opportunity to continue to grow backlogs next year. We have a number of opportunities that we’re pursuing across all sectors. I’ll point to a few next in jammer and Mission Systems, as well as the 3DELRR replacement called SpeedDealer. Also in Mission Systems, we have NGI, the Next Generation Interceptor, which would be in Space. So these are just a few examples of large potential awards, new starts that we could look to, to bolster our book-to-bill next year. But certainly we expect that book-to-bill won’t be as robust as this year, just given the singular effect of the GBSD award and the strong backlog that we have across our sectors. And just to provide a little bit of color on that, we don’t tend to look at awards and book-to-bill on a quarterly basis, we look at on a longer term and we are well above a year of sales in backlog in Space, aerospace – Aeronautics and Mission Systems. Defense Systems tends to run as the short cycle business more with a backlog about equal to sales, but that’s typical. So we see strong backlog in all of our sectors and the opportunity to continue to build backlog at the company level.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein.
Doug Harned: Good morning. I was interested in trying to get a sense for where services are headed. You’ve had some very good top line growth in product sales, but services have really been flat at best. And perhaps you could talk about why that is. And do you expect to see the services revenues grow from here? And do you expect F-35 sustainment to be a significant part of that?
Kathy Warden: Thanks, Doug. So let me start with the last part of the question first, and then I’ll talk more generally about services. We do the F-35 sustainment growth as a contributor to our overall services business, but I’ll also note that some of that F-35 sustainment growth runs through our Aeronautics business and our Mission Systems business. When we’re talking about spares and repairs, those gets done by the businesses that produce the products themselves, not necessarily through our Defense Systems business, where our aircraft modernizations, that team is involved in the sustainment of program for the F-35. So we see sustainment spread across the company and we see that growth contribute to all three of the sectors that I noted. In terms of services growth within Defense Systems, we have seen that business be relatively flat. And we’ve talked about some of the headwinds there that have been running off over the last couple of years based on strategic decisions we’ve made about business to not pursue and that certainly slowed even into our 2021 results. But we’ve also seen some nice new program wins in that business, we talked about our large restricted program earlier in the year. We had a significant award in our services – IT services business in the third quarter. So we are seeing growth, it’s just offset by those headwinds that we’ve been talking about. And as you know, we’ve been executing on that strategic repositioning for our services business in TS and now CS for several years.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Jon Raviv with Citigroup.
Jon Raviv: Thank you, and good morning. Kathy, in your prepared remarks – excuse me, you talked about how there’s uncertainty, but Northrop has strengthening foundation for growth. What about the foundation for strengthening growth? And I ask in the context of really what is the prospect for growth rate to accelerate after 2021, as new programs ramp up, you overcome some headwinds like Lake City. I know in July we talked about Aero unremarkable in 2021 and 2022, but just thinking about growth ahead in sustaining that number as you point to maybe, call it, 3% to 5% in 2021.
Kathy Warden: Yes. Thanks, Jon. Well, as you note, our outlook for 2021 represents another solid year of growth. Growth beyond 2021 will be somewhat dependent on the top line defense budget outlook, but also on our portfolio’s ability to offer the solutions for U.S. governments and our allies field are necessary for their most pressing threats. And our recent success in capturing new work indicates that we do have a strong alignment to those high priority items, but the combination of the budget and portfolio are certainly what will drive our outlook for 2022 and beyond. We’ve seen strong bipartisan support for our key, like B-21, GBSD, F-35 and these two will be the key to continuing to see growth beyond 2021. But given the threat environment, we expect that support to continue for those large programs. And we have a really nice visibility as a result of being on the early end of programs like B-21 and GBSD, which go for many years as you know and have a growth profile in that period. I will acknowledge that flattening budget could lead to fewer new starts, but we feel well positioned and that our backlog has been building over the last couple of years very nicely. And as I noted earlier, in response to your question, we see the potential to continue building that backlog at least into next year.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of David Strauss with Barclays.
David Strauss: Thanks. Good morning.
Kathy Warden: Good morning, David
David Strauss: Kathy and Dave, I want to ask on free cash flow, or I guess first of all on pension, how you’re thinking about that and maybe the potential of the front-end load, some of the pension contributions you’re thinking about in the out years, given the cash balance you’re going to have here. And then thinking about the cash profile from here, it looks like despite everything this year that working capital based on your guidance for the full year, it looks like working capital is going to be fairly neutral. Does that benefit you from here? And then last part of it, your CapEx profile, do you still see that stepping down pretty meaningfully in 2022? Thank you.
Dave Keffer: Sure. Thanks, David. I’m happy to dig into each of those pieces as we look at cash flows in the years 2021 and beyond. I think you’re right that we’ve generated a healthy cash balance at this point with $5 billion at the end of Q3 that certainly enabled us to pay down the $1 billion of debt that we talked about earlier in October. We do continue to plan for a gradual de-leveraging of the balance sheet. So that’s one element of our capital deployment strategy. Investing in the business is certainly – continues to be the hallmark of our capital deployment strategy. On the CapEx side that you asked about, our outlook there is unchanged, $1.35 billion this year and next with a gradual decline in terms of a percentage of sales thereafter. We don’t see anything that would cause us to change that outlook at this point. Returning cash to shareholders remains a priority as well. And as Kathy talked about earlier, we do anticipate restarting our share repurchase program in 2021, and continuing to maintain a competitive dividend. On the pension side, it is something that we look at in terms of the timing of pension contributions that are anticipated to pick up a bit in 2022. As we noted earlier, those are not incorporated into our free cash flow guidance for this year or next, but the opportunity to make voluntary early pension contributions remains a possibility in either of those years. So the bottom line is our intent is not to sit on the current high levels of cash that we have generated over the last couple of years for longer than we believe it’s necessary. And you should expect a nice balanced approach to capital deployment over the next couple of years to continue for us. Digging into the free cash flow question for 2021 a bit further, I think that too is an important topic and I think one to look at on a multi-year basis. So our 2019 cash – free cash flow was up 20 – up 18% from 2018. Our 2020 hire guide that we provided today calls for about 14% growth at the midpoint from 2019, so exceptional growth in that two-year period. 2020 free cash flow benefits about $300 million to $400 million from the payroll tax deferral also benefits a bit from progress payment changes. And then we have some headwinds related to COVID-related delays and the supplier payment accelerations that we’ve done this year, which on an aggregate year-to-date basis total over $800 million. So we continue to support those critical suppliers. As we look at 2021, we’ll have the headwind related to the payroll tax deferral from this year. That’s about 50% of that amount. But we’ll work to offset that to your point through continued working capital management and do feel like we can create a bit of a tailwind there. And with comparable CapEx from 2020 to 2021, when you aggregate all of that, we think the net result for 2021 free cash will be continued strong free cash flow on that multi-year basis, but potentially below the higher 2020 free cash flow guide that we’ve provided today because of that combination of factors.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.
Seth Seifman: Thanks very much, and good morning. I wonder, Kathy, maybe if you could talk a little bit more about the autonomous portfolio and kind of the mechanics and timeframe of – starting to get growth to pick up there. And in particular maybe the Skyborg award and how you guys think about that, given that it’s kind of a different type of program in terms of being a low cost solution and kind of the more high-end stuff that Northrop has been focused on traditionally?
Kathy Warden: Thanks, Seth, I’d be happy to. So let me start by talking about our current autonomous portfolio and looking at tail in particular, so the combination of our Global Hawk and Triton program. We have talked about some budget pressures there. You may be familiar that for Triton the Navy has discussed the production pause for the next two years. And that is what is currently programmed into the Navy’s 2021 budget request. We are working with the Navy and Congress to see what that production pause actually entails in terms of aircraft for next year. But with Australia, we also see some offsets to that production gap that we would experience otherwise with the Navy pause. We do believe the Navy is committed to the program in the long-term based on all of the statements that they’ve made and so this really is a opportunity for the air vehicle to pause and wait for some government provided sensors that would get integrated into the production vehicles going forward. With regard to Global Hawk, the Air Force is contemplating a reduction in their fleet from largely Block 20s and Block 30s and while they’ve signaled that, that is not formal direction at this point. So we really don’t have more color to add on what those pressures might look like for Global Hawk. But we do anticipate that over the next several years that will become more clear and we will have a stronger projection, and that leads to the question that you asked about Skyborg and other analysis of alternatives that are being considered in this case particularly by the air force. But I would note that all of the services, strategic plans, call for a significant contribution by unmanned systems in particular, aerial unmanned systems including not only the air force, but the navy and the Marine Corps. So Skyborg in particular, we look at as an opportunity because of its architectural components more so than just the air vehicle alone. The Skyborg vision is that systems will be operating together instead of on a single platform having the capability to really operate unaided, which is how our HALE platform developed today. That broader range of requirements as you point will be in a lower price point, but have some very sophisticated requirements that need to be addressed in areas like connectivity, vehicle management, all things that across the Northrop Grumman portfolio, we have strong capabilities to contribute. So we’re actually quite excited about opportunities that look beyond the platform itself to the connectivity of other sensors and aircraft, because it starts to engage some of the integration that we can do with our Mission Systems platform – programs and products as well. So really, as we look forward, this is an evolution of unmanned and one that we think is very consistent with what the services have been discussing in systems and systems operating together and the work that we’ve been doing to lead the way in that all-domain command and control of systems unmanned and manned.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen.
Cai von Rumohr: Thank you very much. So Kathy, you mentioned that backlog could grow in 2020 just looking at it doesn’t look like the new opportunities are that huge. Maybe I’m wrong there, but so what would it take to get you, are the existing programs, is there a big increases coming? You’ve already gotten your money on GBSD, but in the other restricted areas what are the key elements that could get you to a higher backlog next year?
Kathy Warden: So Cai I noted a few programs, but as you I’m sure appreciate across our programs sets, the timing of awards of some large like F-35 we expect to have another production, a lot of awards next year, but there are many smaller efforts as well that will just have their natural annual increment particularly production program that will flow in next year that create a significant base and foundation of award. And I just referred to a few of the new awards, the new business that we would see contributing to an ability to get to a one or greater book-to-bill next year. But certainly there are lots of awards that are anticipated in just normal course of business across all four of our sectors.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Hi, good morning, Kathy, Dave and Todd. Just given 10% growth in Mission this quarter and the promotion of Tom Jones to lead Aeronautics, your largest segment from a sub-segment in Mission, how do we think about actual growth drivers of mission growth over the next few years, because outside of GBSD it is your most significant growth contributor in your portfolio?
Kathy Warden: Yes, Sheila and thank you for recognizing that. Certainly Tom Jones at his leadership at Airborne Sensors & Networks inside Mission Systems has contributed to very strong growth for Mission Systems, it has been of the four businesses inside of Mission Systems, the most significant contributor to growth for a couple of years. But I would also note that all of the businesses in Mission Systems contributed to its growth this year. So we have them pleased to see that it isn’t just one of the divisions driving that growth. Speaking to Tom Jones in particular, I have one of the reasons that I’m very pleased to have him stepping into the role at Aeronautics sector is that, in addition to leading our Airborne Sensors & Networks, he was leading our cross-company campaign for Next Generation Air Dominance, which looks at all next generation aircraft and mission systems that would meet the requirements of the government for their sixth-generation fleet. And so in that role, he was already working very closely between our Aeronautics and our Mission Systems sector on how we bring these capabilities together to accomplish the mission that our customers have laid out, both the air force and the navy for their next generation of aircraft and mission program. So that synergy between those two businesses will only get stronger as we have Tom transition into Aeronautics. I’d also note that the team under Tom in Airborne Sensors & Networks is a very strong team. So I fully expect that the growth that we’ve seen there will continue under their leadership.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America.
Ron Epstein: Hey, good morning guys. Thanks. So, Kathy a bigger picture question for you. The classified programs have become such an important piece of Northrop’s business and I guess for important reasons, right there sort of a black box. How do you want investors to think about it? And kind of as follow-on to that or a addendum to that, with the announcement of NGAD and DoD wanting to do more rapid aircraft programs, prototyping the whole Digital Century Series thing, what kind of opportunity does that present for Northrop, because presumably that’s all in the classified world as well.
Kathy Warden: Thanks Ron. So one of the most important things for our performance as the company is the program performance and so what I want our investors to know first and foremost about our classified and restricted work, is that we have the same level of governance over those programs that we do any other program, the appropriate people are cleared into the details of those programs, reviewing them regularly, understanding what they need to perform and providing the resources to them to execute successfully. And so that goes to our ability to continue to have a track record of disciplined and focused performance in our restricted portfolio. Even though, we can’t share as much of that detail with our investor community as we could on our unclassified portfolio. In the second part of your question around digital engineering and the important role that our digital enterprise transformation is going to have on all of our programs going forward, I’d actually start by pointing to GBSD where we are using the digital enterprise as the base for executing that program. The work that we have done with the customer already, even under the tech maturation and risk reduction phase of the program was done in a digital environment. We delivered artifacts for review in a fully-digital environment where they were actually looking at things in a model, not documents produced. This is the first time on a program of this size, where that’s been the case. And we’re very pleased to be pioneering the way in partnership with the air force to make that a reality on the GBSD program. But those investments that we’re making for GBSD are being utilized across our entire portfolio. So as we think about Next Generation Air Dominance and the programs that are part of that overall campaign as I’ll call it, they too will benefit from a full digital engineering thread as being required by our customers. And even in areas like space and mission systems, in addition to aeronautics, each new start is looking at implementing not only the design in a digital way, but a full thread that looks at the producibility and the maintainability through the use of models in the digital environment.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global.
Pete Skibitski: Yes. Thanks. Good morning. Kathy, just to follow-up on Seth’s earlier question regarding HALE UAVs, I know you touched on Australia, but in general, that was a domestic discussion. Can you talk about UAV export policy? Because I thought maybe there had been some changes made to the MTCR, but I don’t know how radical or not those changes have been, but can you give us your updated view there on regulation, around exports for HALEs and maybe whether or not it goes far enough to help exports just given, I think a lot of market share has been seeded to some competitors out there. Thanks.
Kathy Warden: No, I think there were changes to the MTCR and they are very encouraging changes, they will open up more international customers to have potential access. Of course, they still go through the same approval process, but now it looks more favorable upon export of this technology, because it isn’t caught up in the missile technology regime as tightly. And so when we look at this process, we are really pleased that Department of State and the Department of Defense in the U.S. has worked together to make this possible. It will take us some time to work with nations that are now eligible for this technology and get through processes of them requesting it and engaging with them, but it is opening the door that had not been opened before. So over a multiyear period, we do expect us to open up more international sales not just for HALE platform which is what we produce today, but for unmanned systems overall, including ones we might develop in the future
Todd Ernst: And Natalia we have time for one more question.
Operator: The last question is from the line of Myles Walton with UBS.
Myles Walton: Thanks, good morning and thanks for squeezing me in. Maybe a clarification on the pension cash assumptions at 2021 and 2022. Did only FAS move or did CAS and funding respectively changed? And then on Space, your growth there for 2021, I think this year you grew space more than 10% without GBSD, so why the implied deceleration to virtually no growth in 2021 ex-GBSD. Thanks.
Dave Keffer: And Myles, I’ll start on the pension question. We still have a lot of assumptions to finalize there and review internally. And so that’s why it doesn’t make sense for us at this phase to get into a line-by-line detailed review of those assumptions before they’re fully baked. And of course we have to see where discount rates end up as well as a full-year asset performance for this year. It’s possible that there will be movement in both the FAS and the CAS lines, but those are as I mentioned, still in the works, the net result that we’re talking through of 150 to 250 would cover both of those. From a cash perspective, I don’t think you should think of this as being a meaningful change to our 2021 or 2022 outlook. But again, we’ll have more details and we’ll be able to update that on the January call.
Kathy Warden: And I’ll say just very quickly, with strategic space we’ve seen a tremendous amount of growth this year as you pointed to, many of those programs ramped throughout this year and achieved more of a steady state growth into next year. And strategic missiles, as it’s transitioning from GMD to NGI, we’ll see a little bit of flatness until we get through the other side, but all of that is being more than offset by GBSD and some additional growth in strategic space, just not quite as much there in 2021 on a year-over-year compare as we saw in 2020.
Kathy Warden: So why don’t I go ahead and close today’s call by reiterating our thanks to the Northrop Grumman team for another outstanding quarter of performance. It’s especially impressive in light of the challenging conditions that we’ve all faced this year. We are successfully executing on our strategy with solid results through the first three quarters and we’re well-positioned to have a strong finish to this year and continue that momentum into 2021. So thank you for joining us today. We look forward to speaking to you again in late January when we’ll report our full year results and provide 2021 guidance. That concludes our call.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-07-30 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Northrop Grumman’s Second Quarter 2020 Conference Call. Today’s call is being recorded. My name is Shelby and I will be your operator today. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to your host today, Mr. Todd Ernst, Treasurer and Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Ernst, please proceed.
Todd Ernst: Thanks, Shelby. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Northrop Grumman’s second quarter 2020 conference call. We will refer to a PowerPoint presentation that is posted to our IR webpage this morning. Before we start, matters discussed on today’s call, including 2020 guidance and beyond reflect the company’s judgment based on the information available at the time of this call. They constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to Safe Harbor provision of Federal Securities Laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which are noted in today’s press release and our SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties may cause actual company results to differ materially. Today’s call will also include non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to our GAAP results in our earnings release. On the call today are Kathy Warden, our Chairman, CEO and President; and Dave Keffer, our CFO. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Kathy. Kathy?
Kathy Warden: Thank you, Todd. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. We hope you and your families are safe and healthy. I want to start by thanking our employees and recognizing their resiliency and dedication in driving strong second quarter performance in the midst of the COVID pandemic. Along with our customers and suppliers we quickly stood up new work processes and safeguards that allowed us to continue fulfilling customer commitments while strengthening our foundation for the future. And now, as we see new outbreaks of coronavirus in our communities, we continue to prioritize the safety and well-being of our team. This includes flexible work schedules, teleworking, child care assistance, and stringent operating protocols aligned with CDC guidelines to help protect our employees and their loved ones. We also continue to support our suppliers, health care providers, and communities through volunteer time, supplies, and financial resources.  Turning to the results for the quarter, despite the challenges of the coronavirus, we delivered a very strong second quarter operationally and financially. Sales grew 5%, driven by 15% top line growth in space and continued growth at aeronautics and mission systems. Segment operating income grew 4% in line with sales growth, and we generated an 11.6% segment operating margin rate. Cash generation was particularly strong. Cash from operations increased 45% to 2.3 billion and free cash flow increased 53% to 2.1 billion after capital spending of 269 million. Our cash results reflect solid operational performance and benefited from actions taken by our customers to support the industrial base. We have the full supplier benefit of higher progress payments to our suppliers, and we have also instituted our own acceleration of payments to many of our most vulnerable suppliers totaling nearly $500 million year-to-date.  In addition to those financial highlights in the quarter, we continued to execute our long-term growth strategy. Second quarter awards totaled $14.8 billion, a book to bill of 1.7 times sales. And our total backlog has increased 8% since year-end 2019 to more than 70 billion. The strength of our award demonstrates our portfolios alignment with the nation's most critical security priorities including space, nuclear deterrence, advanced weapons, and all domain commands and control. Our innovation and timely investments in these areas are enabling our customer’s vision for future operations.  In space, rapidly evolving threats are driving an urgent need for advanced resilient capabilities and we are competing successfully in this domain. In the second quarter, new awards at space systems totaled $9.2 billion, which included 5.9 billion of restricted awards. In addition to restricted awards, we also booked 1.9 billion to develop two polar orbiting satellites for Next Gen OPIR and approximately 150 million for the preliminary design and development of HALO, the first crew module for NASA's moon orbiting space station as part of Artemis. And we were selected by commercial customers to build four satellites under two separate awards totaling more than 400 million. These awards support the Federal Communication Commission's order to make the lower portion of the C-band spectrum available to mobile network operators, enabling the rollout of critical 5G services.  We are also supporting the modernization of the nation's strategic deterrence with GBSD. GBSD continues to be on track for a late summer award. We expect a booking of between $10 billion to $15 billion for the engineering, manufacturing, and development towards EMD phase of the program, with production to be negotiated at a later date. The successful completion of the preliminary design review in May validates that we are ready to enter the EMD phase. We look forward to delivering a secure, reliable, and effective nuclear deterring capability to our nation. Based on current backlog and future opportunities, we continue to expect space will be our fastest growing business.  In advanced weapons, we are providing innovative solutions that address the need for higher speed, advanced sensors, and precision capabilities. Our broad portfolio of advanced weapons capabilities, including hypersonics, precision systems, directed energy, and advanced munitions [ph] continues to be a source of growth. After completing successful critical design review last quarter, AARGM-ER achieved another milestone in the second quarter. The Navy conducted the first AARGM-ER captive carry flight test on the FA-18 Super Hornet. And we've begun wind tunnel testing. This system provides opportunity to grow our share in the tactical missile market. Also in the quarter, we announced that we surpassed the production and delivery of 50,000 Precision Guidance kits for our 155 millimeter artillery projectiles. And year-to-date, we've booked 154 million in modifications to our big contract for PTK production with the U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps to produce additional kits.  Our overall weapons systems, bookings within our defense system segment are up year-to-date with a 1.2 times book-to-bill. Through our successful integration of Orbital ATK into the Northrop Grumman portfolio we are realizing the strength of the combined team in our space and weapons business performance. We are also proud to be enabling the next generation of battle management. Our networking and computer technology is being incorporated into demonstrations and systems of records showing the value of our open systems, which are affordable and platform agnostic. Next generation programs like joint all domain commands and control, known as JADC2 are aimed at creating an information architecture across all domains. Our experience with the army’s IBCS program and ABMS for the Air Force will help enable the Defense Department to extend the any sensor, any shooter capability across all services. And we are making considerable progress on the IBCS program. Together with the Army, we entered the final round of preparation and training for the system's multi-week limited user test that began shortly after the end of the second quarter. Successful completion of this EMD milestone will support IBCS production, deployment, and fielding to execute the Army's integrated air and missile defense modernization strategy. We are on track for the milestone fee decision later this year, which positions the program to enter production.  For the current generation of mission systems and sensors, we continue to deliver advanced capabilities to address evolving threats. In the mission system sector, we delivered F-35 radars, DAS and C&I in quantities comparable to or better than the second quarter of 2019, despite the impacts of COVID. Our SABR radar upgrades also continue. During the quarter, the Air Force completed integration of our SABR radars on Air National Guard F-16 at its Joint Base Andrews in New Jersey Air National Guard bases. Seven additional bases are scheduled to receive SABR upgrades in the coming months. MS will also be supplying a radio frequency countermeasure systems for the C-130 operated by the Air Force Special Operations Command. Our RFCM system, will help to improve the C-130 aircraft survivability and protect air crews from air and land based enemy radar and missile system. Looking ahead, we are competing for the next generation of electronic warfare capabilities, including Next Gen Jammer Low Band, which should be awarded later this year.  Turning to aeronautics sector, through the end of the second quarter, we delivered 683 F-35 center fuselages and we continue to manufacture at a pace that supports customer deliveries. We adjusted our outlook for F-35 fuselage production volume for AS in the first quarter to account for the anticipated impact of COVID and this has not changed. In addition, during the quarter we also received State Department approval for the future sale of three E2D advanced Hawkeye's and related equipment to France, opening the door to a future award opportunity. And Australia committed to the purchase of three Triton air vehicles. But the B-21 as Air Force public statements indicate we continue to make good progress. And the Air Force currently expect B-21 to move into a low rate production following key development milestones scheduled to complete in 2022.  We are also pleased by the policy changes announced last week regarding the export of unmanned aerial systems. It is critical for our national security that our export policies continue to keep pace with the rapid evolution of technology and support collaboration with our allies. At the half point of the year, we're encouraged that despite the challenge of the pandemic, our team is delivering strong operational results. As we think about our full year guidance, we are assuming that our team's productivity as well as the operations of our customers and suppliers remains at or near current levels. Our update to guidance incorporates the strength of year-to-date results, our current assumptions regarding the continuing pandemic risks and their impact on us, and an expectation that demand for our defense products and services remain strong. Given that context, we are raising 2020 sales, EPS, and free cash flow guidance. Based on our current assumptions, we now expect sales will increase to between $35.3 billion and $35.6 billion and EPS will range between $22 and $22.40. And we are increasing guidance for 2020 free cash flow to a range of $3.15 billion and $3.55 billion after capital spending of approximately $1.35 billion. We are maintaining our guidance for segment operating margin rates at 11.3% to 11.5%, and Dave will discuss each of these items in more detail.  Turning to the U.S. budget environment, we expect to see continued strong bipartisan support for national security. Even under scenarios of flattening or slightly declining defense budgets, we believe our portfolio will remain well aligned to our customer’s highest priority investments. Defense spending is largely threat driven and the threat environment warrants a strong defense. Despite fiscal pressures, emerging threats are intensifying and we believe both political parties are focused on effectively countering these emerging threats. We saw demonstrated bipartisan support for defense spending in the recent House vote to pass the NDAA.  Before I close, I want to highlight that in 2020 Northrop Grumman was once again recognized as a top 50 company for diversity. We are committed to equality, diversity, and inclusion not only in Northrop Grumman but in our supply chain and communities. Our strong performance is enabled by the diversity of our team, which continues to expand. We have hired 8000 new employees in the first half of the year and we expect to hire more than 12,000 by year end. Through their second quarter performance, our team of dedicated men and women in partnership with their suppliers and customers demonstrated their commitment to national security and human advancement. While future impacts of the pandemic remain uncertain, we have a robust pipeline of opportunities and we are strengthening our foundation for growth. Despite the challenges that COVID-19 has presented for every business and individual, the Northrop Grumman team remains committed to the safety and well-being of our people, investing for the future, delivering value to our shareholders, and meeting our commitments to our customers and all of our stakeholders. So now I'll turn it over to Dave.
Dave Keffer: Thanks, Kathy and good morning everyone. I'd also like to thank our employees for their strong performance this quarter. My comments begin with second quarter highlights on Slide 3. We delivered excellent bookings, sales, operating income, EPS, and cash. And we're pleased to be increasing our sales, EPS and free cash flow guidance for the year. I'd also note that as of April 1st, certain unallowable compensation and other costs that we previously reflected in segment results are now in unallocated corporate expense. These are costs that are managed at the corporate level and we made this change as we began to operate within the new sector structure. The Q2 impact of the change was minimal, only increasing second quarter segment operating income by about $1 million. This change has been applied retrospectively and recast results are presented in schedule seven of our earnings release.  Slide 4 provides a bridge between second quarter 2020 and second quarter 2019 earnings per share. EPS increased 19% to $6.01. Operational performance drove $0.26 of the increase. During the quarter we recovered $0.23 of the negative return on marketable securities that we incurred in the first quarter and year-over-year this translated to a $0.17 benefit. Pension also contributed $0.49 of the year-over-year improvement.  I'll begin a review of sector results on Slide 5. Aeronautic sales were up 7% for the quarter and 4% year-to-date. Sales in autonomous systems and manned aircraft were higher in both periods. Higher volume on restricted programs and the E2D drove higher sales in both periods, along with higher Triton volume in the second quarter. Higher volume in these areas was partially offset by lower volume on the F-35 program due to COVID-19 impacts in both periods. At defense systems, sales decreased by 2% for the quarter and are up 2% year-to-date. Mission readiness programs had higher volume in both periods, principally due to higher restricted volume, partially offset by lower volume on the Hunter Sustainment Program as it nears completion. Battle management and missile systems had higher volume in both periods on programs like GMLRs and AARGM-ER but these increases are being offset by programs nearing completion, including Lake City, as that begins to ramp down and an international weapons program that is also winding down.  Mission System sales were up 2% in the second quarter and 4% year-to-date. Higher volume on airborne sensors and networks programs where we had higher volume on radar programs like MESA and SABR drove sales growth in both periods. These increases were partially offset in both periods by lower volume in SABR and intelligence mission solutions due to a program nearing completion. Space system sales rose 15% in the second quarter and 11% year-to-date due to higher volume in both business areas. Higher volume on restricted programs and other space programs like Next Generation OPIR and the Arctic Satellite Broadband Mission or ASBM program contributed to higher sales in both periods. Turning to segment operating income on Slide 6. Aeronautics operating income increased 4 percent and margin rate was 10.6 percent. year-to-date is margin rate is 9.9%. In both periods, the margin rate trend reflects lower net positive EAC adjustments in autonomous programs, as well as a changing contract mix in manned aircraft. These trends were partially offset by a $21 million benefit in the second quarter related to the resolution of a government accounting matter that we had expected might occur later this year. At defense systems, operating income increased by 2% in the quarter and was comparable year-to-date. Operating margin rate increased to 11.5% in the quarter due to improved performance in mission readiness programs. And their year-to-date margin rate of 11% is slightly lower, principally due to favorable adjustments on certain small caliber programs in the first quarter of 2019. Operating income at Mission Systems rose 3% in the quarter and 6% year-to-date. Operating margin rate increased to 14.2% in the quarter and to 14.6% year-to-date, reflecting improved performance in both periods. Space systems operating income rose 8% in the quarter and 7% year-to-date. Second quarter operating margin rate declined to 10.2% due to delays in production on certain commercial space components and year-to-date operating margin rate declined to 10.3%.  Turning to Slide 7, based on better than expected aeronautics sales in the second quarter, we're increasing AS sales guidance to the low to mid $11 billion range. However, as we look beyond this year in AS, we expect to experience continued top line pressure in our commercial aerospace business and budget tightness in certain of our HALE programs. We continue to expect a margin rate of approximately 10% for AS in 2020. Sales and operating margin rate guidance for our defense, mission, and space system sectors are unchanged.  Moving to consolidated guidance on Slide 8, we're raising 2020 sales, adjusted EPS, and free cash flow guidance to reflect the strength of year-to-date results. Driven by the increase in AS we now expect 2020 sales will range between $35.3 billion and $35.6 billion, a $200 million to $300 million increase over prior guidance. Our higher EPS guidance reflects $0.20 of operational improvement that we experienced in the second quarter. No change to expected tax rate or year-end weighted average share count. Based on our second quarter results and current expectations for the remainder of the year, we expect mark-to-market adjusted EPS to be between $22 and $22.40. For free cash flow we're raising the top of our guidance of $100 million to 3.55 billion. Our Q2 cash flow reflected a combined benefit of approximately $300 million for the CARES Act, payroll tax deferrals, and an increase in certain progress payments from our customers. For the year we expect a combined benefit of $400 million to $500 million from these changes. We expect these benefits to working capital will be partially offset by accelerated payments to our suppliers and potential impacts of COVID on the timing of certain collections. But given our expectations for the overall effect of these changes and the strength of our Q2 cash flow results, we have increased the top-end of our free cash flow guidance range.  Slide 9 provides a bridge between April's guidance and today's full year EPS outlook. The increase in guidance reflects $0.20 of second quarter operational improvement. I would note that we're not increasing guidance for this quarter's positive returns on marketable securities as there's still a long way to go until year-end and asset returns may continue to be volatile. Regarding cash deployment, we continue to pursue a balanced capital deployment strategy that includes investing in the business, managing the balance sheet, and returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. During the pandemic we're also especially closely monitoring the health of our supply chain, and we're accelerating certain payments to help us continue to execute on commitments to our customers. Through the end of the second quarter, our year-to-date share repurchases totaled approximately $500 million and we've met our approximate share count target for 2020. Share repurchases remain an important part of our capital deployment strategy. We continue to be committed to paying a competitive dividend and in May we raised our dividend by approximately 10%. We're also focused on deleveraging the balance sheet and we expect to retire $1 billion in maturing debt this fall.  Before closing one topic that I want to touch on is the potential upcoming R&D tax change. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act currently requires a shift from expensing R&D costs for tax purposes to amortizing them over five years starting in 2022. As many of you know, this law would affect Northrop Grumman and many of our industry peers given the substantial R&D investments that we make each year. If the law is not changed before 2022, we would estimate a potential cash flow impact that could be approximately $1 billion that year. We would expect that impact would decline by about 20% each year for the following four years as the amortized costs approach a steady state closer to today's level of expense costs.  In closing, we're very pleased with our second quarter and year-to-date results. While our COVID-19 impacts in Q2 were less significant than we originally expected, the future path of the pandemic and its various related impacts on us remain uncertain, and we continue to monitor the situation closely. Overall, our portfolio is well aligned with evolving customer priorities, we continue to execute to deliver value for our shareholders, and we continue to invest in the future. With that Todd I think we're ready to open up the call for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Ron Epstein of Bank of America.
Ronald Epstein: Good morning. Kathy, could you just give us a quick update if you can on where we stand with the GBSD and when you might expect that decision to come?
Kathy Warden: Yes Ron, thanks. We still expect that the Air Force will meet its schedule of making the award for the EMD phase of the program in late August of this year. And we are in the process of discussions with them to meet that objective.
Operator: Your next question is from Sheila Kahyaoglu of Jefferies.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Good morning everyone and thank you. Kathy, maybe for you. You talked about moving pieces within aeronautics margins, you had a settlement in the quarter but overall profitability was better. Can you talk about some of the puts and takes maybe risk around COVID versus the offsets and then I think you mentioned continued top line pressure in commercial aero which is obvious there and some budget tightening, so if you could elaborate on that?
Dave Keffer: Sure, I'm happy to kick that one off, Sheila. So a few of the points you mentioned, I think are worth talking about now. In As we did have a very strong operational Q2 we talked on our last call about the COVID impacts on the business at the time of the call on a Q2 to date basis. Following that timeline, there was quicker than expected recovery from the business impacts of COVID on our AS business. And as the quarter progressed, we also had favorable timing on some materials that boosted results of the quarter. And the non-operational item that we talked about in our scripted comments and mentioned in our filings around the government accounting matter helped Q2 and we thought that may occur later in the year. So a very strong operational quarter combined with those other factors I mentioned. On an ongoing basis to your point, there are obviously continued pressures on the commercial portion of the business, but we're certainly pleased with the Q2 results of AS.
Operator: Your next question is from Peter Arment of Baird.
Peter Arment: Good morning, Kathy and David, nice quarter. Kathy, can I ask a bigger picture question on the space segment, just kind of touching upon the kind of long-term trends on the margin front. I mean, you're getting all this growth. I assume you're going to have GBSD kind of work flowing through here in a significant way. And given that over 70% of the mix is cost plus, is this a segment that can hold the kind of a 10% margin or how should we think about it just given all the growth and success you've got here?
Kathy Warden: So Peter, as we think about the margins for space, you're hitting on the right point, the mix will be the biggest driver of margins. Great over time but we do expect to see significant growth in that segment. The margin dollar expansions we're expecting to be quite solid. But on the race itself, as you noted, as we see that mix already a heavy preponderance towards cost type contracts and then adding GBSD, which will also be a cost type program for the EMD. For quite a while, we will have a mix that lends itself to a lower margin rate than what we would experience if we had a higher volume of that business in production. But many of the programs in that business will move to production sooner than GBSD. So GBSD is one of the longest cycles of the programs in that portfolio, it will be in EMD through 2029. But with other programs that we are booking into space as we've seen our bookings grow quite nicely, we'll transition to production in a shorter period of time. So we'll see that mix certainly evolve in the near-term, but over the long-term we will still have a considerable amount of cost plus business in that portfolio.
Operator: Your next question is from Seth Seifman of J.P. Morgan.
Seth Seifman: Thanks very much and good morning. Dave you mentioned the headwinds on the top line in aero next year. And just to -- is there a way to calibrate that a little more, should we expect growth in this segment next year and it just will be more moderate because of those headwinds or did those headwinds prevent growth in the segment?
Kathy Warden: So as we think about aero on a go forward basis, I would point to our year-to-date growth of about 4% in that business, which is in line with what we had expected for the year and what we're guiding. And although we're not guiding into next year at this point, to tell you the longer-term trajectory for that business is that it won't be one of our fastest growing segments. We've seen a good bit of that portfolio begin to shift also to cost type work that grew significantly. And now it's leveling out and production also on our key programs there is more in a steady state. So the fastest growing segments in our portfolio will certainly be space, but aero will be a nice contributor to the portfolio in terms of some stable and steady programs that are large contributors not only to growth, but solid margin rate performance.
Operator: Your next question is from Robert Stallard of Vertical Research.
Robert Stallard: Thanks so much. Good morning. You had a very good quarter for order intake in Q2. And I was wondering if any of these awards will result in an increase in self-funded R&D or CAPEX in terms of seed funding at the start?
Dave Keffer: Hey Rob it is Dave. So it was a really strong quarter, particularly for restricted awards and particularly for awards in our space sector. So we're really pleased with the backlog growth in those portions of the business. We haven't changed our CAPEX outlook for the year. Longer term we've said in the past that we expect a similar volume of CAPEX in 2021 before that begins to decline as a percentage of revenue thereafter. We think that CAPEX outlook remains our best information as of today and we'll continue to really focus those CAPEX investments on the portion of our business, the portions of our business with the strongest growth potential, key customers, key capabilities to drive differentiated capability in areas that are consistent with the national defense strategy.
Operator: Your next question is from Jon Raviv of Citi.
Jon Raviv: Thank you and good morning. Kathy, just kind of going back to the big picture here, obviously a lot of conversation that you addressed also in terms of pressured budget environment. But what is your perspective on accelerating growth, not just sales but really EBIT dollar growth segment, EBIT dollar growth going forward, just as the budget slows down, I think that's a little sort of digression that that is not always appreciated that you guys can actually accelerate growth while the market might slow?
Kathy Warden: Thanks. Yes, as our backlog is growing quite nicely, we see that providing a strong foundation for growth. We also are encouraged by our portfolio of alignment with the priorities in the national defense strategy. And I would tell you that goes beyond the defense strategy as it's written today. It really is a look at our portfolio compared to the threats that our nation and our allies are facing. And we certainly see space as a domain where there will continue to be an evolution of capability to address increasingly advanced threats from other nations and just the steps for space as a domain that now can offer much more war fighting capability to our nation and its allies. That's one example. But I could give you the same as we talk about weapons and the evolution of weapon systems or the importance of networking in all of these war fighting assets for advanced commands and control. And so that type of alignment of our portfolio says that if the threat continues to evolve in the way that it is today, there would be durability in our ability to continue to grow. And I would point to one other thing, which is the innovation that we are driving as a company that addresses some of the nation's most critical threats and is allowing us to win the work that you're showing us -- that you're seeing show up in our booking. That innovation is as Dave alluded to, targeted investments that we're making in our R&D and our CAPEX to be able to demonstrate for our customers the maturity of technology to address these evolving threats. And I'm quite proud of how our team is doing that. And it will be an increasingly part of the -- increasing part of the selection process that the government uses to determine the partners they will work with on a go forward basis. So those three elements of how we're executing gives me confidence that this business can continue to thrive even in a flat or slightly declining budget environment if, I think the primary if is the threat vector continues to be aligned with what it is today and we expect that to be the case.
Operator: Your next question is from Doug Harned of Bernstein.
Douglas Harned: Good morning, thank you. I wanted to go to aeronautics and specifically on F-35. And if you think about F-35 as now basically new production, upgrades, sustainment, a lot of this would appear that you'll be topping out kind of a new production, but the upgrades and sustainment are going to be growth opportunities. How does Northrop Grumman play in those three and how do you see that collectively contributing to growth over the next few years?
Kathy Warden: Doug this is Kathy. The F-35 program will continue to be a really important part of our portfolio. We are involved in all three stages of the life cycle on the program and I would characterize those as production, modernization, and sustainment. And for production, as we've noted before we tend to run about 18 months ahead of Lockheed Martin in delivering a center fuselage and ahead also in the delivery of Mission Systems. So we will reach peak production sooner than Lockheed. But if you look at the quantities that they're projecting, we don't reach peak for a while on that program. Modernization is interesting and that for the mission systems, we actually will go back to retrofitting old platforms so the production volume there, once we get through the development stage of the upgrade program, will increase production once again in mission system. And then of course in sustainment, we're seeing that part of the portfolio grow as we get more aircraft fielded. And that's not just in the U.S., but as our global partners are also taking possession of the aircraft. So each of the stages of the program presents opportunity for us in the near-term. In the longer term, it's the modernization and sustainment spaces that will support growth.
Operator: Your next question is from Carter Copeland of Melius Research.
Carter Copeland: Hey, good morning. Kathy, I wanted to ask you about the reimbursement of COVID costs and whatnot. I noted that in the industry's letter on the reimbursement of those costs and Northrop wasn't -- didn't participate in that. And I just wondered, do you guys have a lower COVID impact or you have better ability to absorb those costs, I just found that interesting and wondering if you can give us some color on it? Thanks.
Kathy Warden: So yes, it's true that I chose not to sign onto those letters. I want to make it clear though that we are supportive of a strong national defense and recognize that funds need to be appropriated to support that objective and we are directly engaged in supporting that cause. However, we did see that our impacts from COVID were less significant than we are seeing projected elsewhere. And therefore we have continued to focus on that very issue, making these impacts as small as possible so that we are not in a position where we have an additional bill for taxpayers to get capability delivered and will continue to be focused on that as our primary objective. And that includes everything from keeping our workplaces safe so that our employees can continue to come to work and feel that they can be productive. It is continuing to partner with our suppliers to ensure they have what they need to continue operating effectively and continuing to work with our customers to be innovative in how we continue to get work done even in light of constraints and how we would normally conduct operations. And I would say on all fronts, our team has been both innovative as well as strong partners to our teammates and customers to be able to navigate their way through. And that's allowed us to have this lesser impact than we anticipated as we sat here a quarter ago.
Operator: Your next question is from David Strauss of Barclays.
David Strauss: Thanks. Good morning. Hi, Kathy. It sounded like in the prepared remarks, you highlighted the headwinds that you're seeing as we look out the 2021 in aerospace systems. Anything else, Kathy as we think about modeling 2021, we should think about in terms of modeling headwinds, I think you might still have a bit of a headwind from Lake City and James Webb Space Telescope, just trying to think about that as we look out the 2021? Thanks.
Kathy Warden: So I'll start and then Dave can walk you through some of the details. As we look forward into 2021 there's nothing additional that we haven't already spoken about that present significant headwinds that we know of as we sit here today. The three things that I would point you to and then Dave can walk you through them is Lake City. As you said, the James Webb Space Telescope will launch next year. And so we have expected the volume to continue to decline as we near completion on that satellite. You may have noticed that the dates of the launch moved slightly next year from March to October based on some COVID related impacts. That program is in final integration and test. And as a result, there are a number of observers from NASA and the testing was impacted slightly by people's inability to travel and work full shifts during COVID. So we did see a slight movement there in schedule, but we do still anticipate it to launch next year and as a result, that program will continue to decline in year-over-year sales. And then the third thing that I would point you to that we've spoken about on prior calls are some headwinds in the HALE portfolio with both Triton and Global Hawk. And as we work through this year's budget, we are -- we'll get better clarification on what those headwinds might be. They don't present risk in 2020, but as we look forward into 2021 they could start to present some headwinds. So Dave anything you would like to add on any of those three or anything additional. 
Dave Keffer: Sure just a little more color on each of those topics, on Lake City, just to quantify that a bit further, we think the 2021 headwind is likely to be around 1% of revenue. That's consistent within range we've given in the past or an estimate we've provided before. James Webb, as Kathy mentioned, I think we'll end up being more of a 2022 headwind than a 2021 headwind given the timing. That program is smaller in its annual revenue than Lake City. And then on the HALE portfolio, I think there are more moving pieces and budget determinations to be made and such so I wouldn't begin to quantify that challenge next year or beyond. And of course, all of this should be cast as well with the light of the space program, which is expected -- or the space business expected to be our largest -- I am sorry, our fastest growing business not only this year but beyond the large new development programs in that business that have bolstered its backlog this year and should continue to do so or sources of nice top line opportunity in 2021 and beyond.
Operator: Your next question is from Joseph DeNardi of Stifel.
Joseph DeNardi: Yeah, good morning. Kathy, can you just give us an update on the space logistics, the mission extension vehicle opportunity that you kind of acquired through Orbital maybe what some of the conversations are like there with the customers, I think that's kind of a unique capability for you all? And then could you be a little bit more specific on when peak is for F-35, you said it's a while, can you be any more specific? Thank you.
Kathy Warden: Sure. Let me start with our mission extension vehicle. As some of you may recall, we returned the customer satellite Intelsat 901 to service in April of this year. And it was the first docking of a life extension vehicle to an active satellite ever accomplished. And I'm very proud of the team for that. First of a kind, it's opening up a whole new set of opportunities and mission extension. And under the terms of that contract, we are going to be working with this through space logistics, four or five years to provide the services. At the same time, we have been working on our second mission extension vehicle and it has arrived at its launch site in French Guyana. And we actually expect that launch to occur in the next few days. And then in MEV 2 will dock with another Intelsat satellite to provide life extension services for it. That docking should occur in early 2021, and this just gives you a little color on what's happening on the program. But to the broader point, this is a market area that we are pioneering first in commercial and the application of it also into military grade satellite as the future holds. And this is something that our Orbital ATK team had started, but as we have integrated into Northrop Grumman has continued and we're leveraging the expertise and experience of the whole team as we look at the future set of opportunity.  You also asked about F-35. Really, I would not provide any additional color or guidance. As we do 2021 guidance we'll share some more insight into what we planned for the three components of the program that I spoke about production, sustainment, and modernization. I would say that each of those three pieces of the program and in the two sectors, the two sectors that primarily support the program, and then that there are a number of moving parts on those assumptions due to COVID-19 impact. We're working very closely with Lockheed Martin to understand what those quantities are, and we'll be able to provide you more insight as we guide for 2021.
Operator: Your next question is from Myles Walton of UBS.
Myles Walton: Thanks, good morning. First one is a clarification, Kathy on the 5.9 billion of classified awards in space, was that dominated by a single award and I'm not sure you've ever got one quite that size before? And then the other is, if you can just make a comment on the national security space launch contract outcome or competition outcome and what your intention is for Omega if it doesn't go your way? Thanks.
Kathy Warden: Sure, so the large award in restricted space is indeed driven by a single award and it is quite significant. I can't provide any color on what it is, but suffice it to say, this is a long term program as a result of the size of the effort. And in answer to your second question on national security space launch, we are expecting that award to come later this quarter. And we have been progressing, as you know, to prepare our Omega rocket for the requirements of the award, which would be to launch next year in 2021. We are on track. We would be able to meet those requirements through our offering. And if we are not successful, we would continue to leverage that investment that we and the Air Force have made through the first two phases of the program into other propulsion activities in our GMD business. So this is an area that we like many selected to make this investment not only for the potential of a single contract award, it represented a national security space launch. But because it was a way to share our research and development investments across the product line that we can now utilize for other endeavors.
Operator: Your next question comes from Robert Spingarn of Credit Suisse. 
Robert Spingarn: Hi, good morning. Kathy, I want to try to phrase this question in a way that you can hopefully answer but typically, when you go from EMD to production unmanned aircraft do you tend to see margins on those first few l-RIP plots below equal to or above the margins that you saw towards the end of EMD and is there any reason to think that that behavior would change in the future? Thank you.
Kathy Warden: So Robert it depends on the contract on any given manned aircraft as to whether those first production units are incorporated into what's already been negotiated or whether they are indeed part of a new contract. And so, if they were contracted as part of the initial award, you would not expect to see the booking rate change because their cost for development would already be incorporated into the booking rate of that effort.
Operator: Your next question comes from Cai von Rumohr of Cowen.
Cai von Rumohr: Yes, thank you. Thank you very much. So Kathy started kind of highlighting all the news in space and you also mentioned the GBSD is still expected in August and I think on the first part of the call you said it might be about 200 million added to this year. Given holdings [ph] wins is there a decent chance that we will see space following in the second half and so instead of being a low $8 billion revenue number it could be closer to a mid-$8 billion number? 
Kathy Warden: Well look I'm really comfortable with our guide which is approximately 8. And so if you take first half revenue you get to a number that is slightly below 8. So to your point there is some growth that needs to occur in the second half but as I said we are very comfortable with the guidance that growth is reasonable based on what we know today. 
Operator: Your next question is from Richard Safran of Seaport Global. 
Richard Safran: Good morning Kathy, Dave, and Todd, how are you doing? Listen, I would like to ask you to if you could expand on your comments on contract mixed with space. For the company overall given your knowledge of new programs could you discuss how you see the overall and long-term contract mix changing in terms of fixed price and cost plus, how that might impact margins? And in your answer could you also update us on the expected long-term growth of classified versus unclassified contracts? 
Dave Keffer: Sure, it is Dave. I will be happy to provide that answer. Today as we talked about in the past we are around 50:50 in terms of fixed price versus cost plus in our mix. And that as you know is heavily determined by the phase of lifecycle programs that we happen to be in at any given time and the key drivers of that mix. On a going forward basis given some of the awards we've talked about to date and those that are expected in the second half of the year, in particular those large development efforts in the space business, we would anticipate that the cost plus mix would increase above the 50% level and that the fixed price would decline. These are our figures at the company level as opposed to any particular segment level. Of course cost plus business as well as perhaps more predictable and stable in margin rates in a typical scenario does tend to be at lower margin rates than their overall fixed price business. And so as that mix shifts certainly we are expected to lead to margin dollar growth and we will look to offset a portion of that impact on overall margins through really strong contract performance, program performance, careful management of our costs, etc. So that's the overall kind of trend that I think you should be expecting as we have these large new development programs entering the portfolio. 
Operator: Your next question is from Hunter Keay of Wolfe Research. 
Hunter Keay: Hi everybody, good morning. Kathy can you talk about the potential long-term opportunity for NGAD. I realize this is not a new program concept but it feels like it is kind of coming into form with the air force's digital century series initiative, so can you help me frame how you're thinking about NGAD opportunity through that lens? Thank you. 
Kathy Warden: So if we think about any new development program through a couple of lens; one, do we have the capability that we can offer a value add to the government and two, should we prime the effort or should we partner with the effort. And with our business and the opportunity for us to do work both on the platform itself and to the Mission Systems we sometimes make those decisions together and sometimes make them separately. I would say for digital century series because of the way it is developing and it's meant to be incremental and rapid, we continue to look at each increment and make the determination of where we conduct that value. So both our Mission Systems and our aeronautics sector are engaged in meaningful dialogue with the Air Force on the program and have work associated with the effort. But these increments will each represent different opportunities based on the requirements and whether we would play as the prime at the platform level or as primarily a Mission Systems provider. 
Operator: Your next question is from George Shapiro of Shapiro Research. 
George Shapiro: Yes, good morning. Kathy if you can I wanted some more color on the F-35, it was kind of surprising to me that your revenue was down and Lockheed showed double-digit gain. So is that reflecting the 18 months that you are ahead of them or this quarter was just unique to COVID or any additional color you could provide contrasting the two different numbers? 
Dave Keffer: Sure, we won't go so far as to talk about anyone else's results but we'll give you a sense for ours in the quarter. There were some COVID impacts on the program in the quarter. We talked about the impacts on F-35 among other similar programs on our last call. And experienced those impacts in the quarter which did affect the year-over-year growth rate for the program in the quarter. As Kathy mentioned earlier, the timing of our business related to F-35 in both the aeronautics segment and the Mission Systems segment are different than the prime timing given the nature of the work and so I think you can expect slightly different kind of trends in those businesses over time as we've had in the past. I think COVID impacts were the primary Q2 items of note there. 
Todd Ernst: Alright and we're at the end of the time here, so I would like to turn it over to Kathy for some closing comments. 
Kathy Warden: Thanks Todd. I would like to conclude by thanking the Northrop Grumman team for their dedication and perseverance which enabled us to continue to operate so well during the global pandemic. It has taken innovation, partnership with our suppliers and customers, and just sheer determination and I am really proud of what they have accomplished this quarter and expect they will continue. I want to wish you and your family’s continued good health and thanks for joining us on the call today. I really look forward to engaging with you in the weeks and months ahead. Take care. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen this concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-04-29 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Northrop Grumman’s First Quarter 2020 Conference Call. Today’s call is being recorded. My name is Josh and I will be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host today, Mr. Todd Ernst, Treasurer and Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Ernst, please proceed.
Todd Ernst: Thanks, Josh. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Northrop Grumman’s first quarter 2020 conference call. We will refer to a PowerPoint presentation that is posted to our IR webpage this morning. Before we start, matters discussed on today’s call, including 2020 guidance reflect the company’s judgment based on the information available at the time of this call. They constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to Safe Harbor provision of federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which are noted in today’s press release and our SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties may cause actual company results to differ materially. Matters discussed on today’s call will include non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled in our earnings release and supplemental PowerPoint presentation. Our earnings release contains a reconciliation of non-GAAP operating measures to our GAAP results. On the call today are Kathy Warden, our Chairman, CEO and President; and Dave Keffer, our CFO. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Kathy. Kathy?
Kathy Warden: Thank you, Todd. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. Before turning to our quarterly earnings, I would like to address the COVID-19 impact. I want to thank those who have been working to keep us safe, particularly those on the frontlines in the healthcare and first responder communities. I also want to thank our Northrop Grumman employees. While each of us faces unique challenges, our team’s dedication to the mission is allowing us to continue providing products and services to our customers. Our first priority is protecting the health, safety and well-being of our team. We are requiring telecommuting for those who can do so and we have enhanced the safety of workspaces for those who must come to work in person. Our facilities remain open and we are taking extraordinary measures in an effort to maintain healthy working condition. These include implementing staggered shifts, health monitoring, social distancing, face coverings and more robust cleaning. In addition, we have expanded employee benefits and well-being programs. We are also supporting our suppliers with a particular focus on our small and midsized business partners. We are advancing approximately $30 million of payments per week to critical, small and midsized suppliers and we expect these payment advances will exceed $200 million. In addition, with the actions taken by the Department of Defense to increase progress payments, we are flowing that full supplier benefit to our suppliers in a timely fashion. While we have not had a material supply chain disruption, some are being impacted more than others and our global supply chain team continues to actively engage with our suppliers to address issues and find new opportunities to help them and we are supporting our local communities. We are donating to organizations involved in COVID-19 relief efforts, supporting frontline healthcare workers, first responders and service members, providing funds to food banks and helping students get access to technology for virtual learning. We are also providing in-kind donation. One example is a company-wide initiative to produce headbands and assemble thousands of face shields for hospitals. Turning to first quarter performance, as a result of our employees’ efforts, our company did not experience a material operating impact from the pandemic in the first quarter. We delivered a good operating quarter with 5% sales growth, solid operating margin and a strong backlog. Looking ahead to the remainder of the year, we are adjusting our guidance to reflect our estimate of the pandemic’s impact as we understand it today. We are updating our 2020 guidance for sales to between $35 billion and $35.4 billion, a little less than 1% lower than prior guidance at the midpoint. Our update to sales guidance reflects expected COVID-19 related impacts, primarily at Aeronautics, including their exposure to commercial aerospace markets. We are maintaining our guidance for segment operating margin rate and we continue to expect our segment operating margin will range between 11.3% and 11.5%. Although we now expect a margin rate of approximately 10% at AS, this has been offset by an increase in Mission Systems outlook. We now expect Mission Systems will have a low to mid 14% margin rate. So, as a result of the revenue impact, first quarter marketable securities impact and interest related to the first quarter bond offering, we now expect our EPS will range between $21.80 and $22.20. And Dave will discuss each of these items in more detail. Cash from operations and free cash flow were negative in the quarter as is our typical pattern. We continue to expect 2020 free cash flow will range between $3.15 billion and $3.45 billion after capital spending of approximately $1.35 billion. With additional measures in place to help protect our employees, we continue to execute on our program and I want to highlight a few of our quarter’s achievements. At Aeronautics, through the end of the first quarter, we have delivered 656 F-35 center fuselages. AS delivered 2 E2D Advanced Hawkeyes to Japan in mid-March and two Global Hawks to the Republic of Korea shortly after the end of the quarter and our MQ-4C Triton was deployed to U.S. military commanders in the Pacific to provide greater maritime intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance. At Defense Systems, we completed the critical design review for the EMD phase of AARGM-ER. The program remains on track with the successful CDR and initial testing of subsystems, including the new extended range rocket motor. In addition, DS supported the CDC’s COVID-19 response effort by creating over 400 webpages in three languages that have received over 900 million page views providing important information about the pandemic spread. At Mission Systems, our SABR radar upgrade program for F-16 continues to expand. SABR now has production contracts for approximately 670 systems across multiple customers. The Air Force recently exercised an option for 105 radars under their $1 billion SABR IDIQ contract. This order included 33 radars for Air Combat Command jets, which establishes SABR as the system of record for the active Air Force. And in February, the Marine Corps ordered 2 additional GATOR systems to complete their Lot 2 award. GATOR replaces 5 legacy systems with a single system, providing significant performance improvement in each of its mode, while reducing training, logistics and maintenance costs. At Space Systems, we were awarded 2 small, but strategically significant DARPA contracts. The first is Glide Breaker, an R&D and demonstration program to develop component for a lightweight interceptor to defeat hypersonic boost glide weapons at very long range. We have previously discussed the successful docking of our first mission extension vehicle to the Intelsat 901 spacecraft. This marked the first time two commercial satellites docked in orbit and the first time that satellite life extension services are being provided to a satellite in geosynchronous orbit. This accomplishment laid the groundwork for the second DARPA award, which establishes a partnership between DARPA and Northrop Grumman for the next generation of remote servicing of geosynchronous satellite. Under the agreement, DARPA will provide an advanced robotic payload to integrate with the Northrop Grumman provided spacecraft. This disruptive technology could significantly expand on orbit servicing capability to include robotic services. Under the agreement, we will retain the spacecraft, payload and IP for commercial use. In the quarter, Space Systems was also awarded restricted competitive prime contracts totaling multiple billions of dollars in aggregate. While we and the nation are keenly focused on defeating COVID-19, we must also continue to address the myriad of other national security threats. Our portfolio and investments continue to be closely aligned with the national defense strategy and our customers’ long-term priorities. This is evident in the President’s budget request for fiscal year 2021, which proposes increased funding for strategic deterrence, hypersonic weapons, missile defense, advanced network, cyber and space systems. The Department of Defense, our primary customer, is seeking robust fiscal 2021 funding, which will be the subject of congressional debate later this year. The DoD budget request supports investments in our current capabilities, including B-21, SABR, E-2D, advanced weapons, OPIR and other space programs, while also increasing funding for future opportunities aligned with our investments, including GBSD, Jab C2, and missile defense programs like IBCS and next generation interceptor. Turning to capital deployment, first quarter share repurchases totaled approximately $350 million and we retired approximately 1 million shares. In April, under an established repurchase program, we bought approximately 400,000 shares for $130 million. Combining first quarter repurchases with April amounts, we have met our approximate target for the year. We remain committed to offering a competitive dividend, in addition de-leveraging the balance sheet remains a priority and we expect to retire the $1 billion in maturing debt this fall. In closing, we remain well-positioned to create value going forward. We are fortunate that through the first quarter, our operations have not been materially disrupted. While future impacts of the pandemic remain uncertain, we have a robust pipeline of opportunities, including GBSD, which continues on track for an award later this year. We also continue to lay the foundation for the future. We are actively recruiting for 10,000 open positions and we hired more than 3,500 people in the first quarter, which included more than 1,300 new hires in March. We appreciate the government’s action to support the industry’s most vulnerable businesses, including increasing progress payments, COVID related cost recovery through the CARES Act, accelerated and timely award and support for essential work designation. Despite the challenges that COVID-19 has presented for every business and individual, through the dedication of our talented workforce, we remain committed to investing for the future, delivering value to our shareholders and meeting our commitments to our customers and all of our stakeholders. Now, I will turn it over to Dave.
Dave Keffer: Thanks, Kathy and good morning, everyone. Before I begin my comments, I would call your attention to this morning’s 8-K filing that recast certain sections of our 2019 Form 10-K to reflect our new sector alignment. We also provided a schedule in our earnings release that provides recast sales and operating income by sector for the last 3 years in each of the quarters in 2019. My comments begin with first quarter highlights on Slide 3. Excluding the impacts of the pandemic, our first quarter results were about as expected. Sales were up 5%, reflecting top line growth in all four of our businesses. Segment OM was solid at 11.1% and net awards totaled $7.9 billion. Awards were particularly strong at space, where total backlog increased 3%. Earnings per share increased 2% to $5.15. Slide 4 provides a bridge between first quarter 2019 EPS and first quarter 2020 EPS. While we did not have material COVID-19 operational impacts in Q1 and our businesses performed largely as expected, the volatility in capital markets did impact earnings as losses on marketable securities and the related tax impacts reduced this year’s first quarter earnings. I will begin a review of sector results on Slide 5. Aeronautics sales were up 1% for the quarter with higher volume at both autonomous systems and manned aircraft. Higher volume on restricted programs and Global Hawk drove the increase partially offset by ramp-downs in B-2 DMS and NATO AGS as those programs near completion. While not a significant factor in first quarter results, later in March we did begin to see COVID-19 related volume pressure in the supply chain and in employee attendance, particularly at certain manufacturing facilities. I will talk more about this when we cover guidance. At Defense Systems, sales rose 6% due to higher volume in both its business areas. Battle Management and Missile Systems growth was driven by higher volume for GMLRS, AARGM, and other missile products. Higher sales at Mission Readiness reflect higher volume on an international training program and higher volume on SEMA, an aircraft sustainment program. Mission Systems sales Part 2 Mission Systems sales were also up 6%. Higher volume for airborne radar programs, including F-35 and SABR drove higher sales in our airborne sensors and networks business. Maritime/Land Systems and Sensors also grew sales due to higher volume on marine systems and restricted programs. Space Systems sales rose 8% due to higher volume on restricted programs and other space programs like next-generation OPIR and the Arctic Satellite Broadband Mission program. Increases in space programs were partially offset by lower volume in launch and strategic missiles. Trends in that business reflect lower volume for the ground-based Midcourse Defense program and SLS booster partially offset by increases in hypersonic activities and the GBSD Technology Maturation Risk Reduction program. Turning to segment operating income on Slide 6, Aeronautics operating income declined 16% and margin rate declined to 9.1%. Lower net positive EAC adjustments in autonomous systems programs as well as the timing of F-35 risk retirements and contract mix in manned aircraft programs were the primary drivers of the operating income trend at Aeronautics. At Defense Systems, operating income decreased 3% and operating margin rate declined to 10.4%. This trend reflects a difficult comparison to the prior year’s quarter in which we had favorable adjustments on certain small caliber ammunition programs. Operating income at Mission Systems rose 9% and operating margin rate increased 40 basis points to 14.8%. Higher operating income reflects higher sales as well as improved performance on airborne sensors and networks programs partially offset by contract mix at Maritime/Land Systems and Sensors and the timing of risk retirements for navigation, targeting and survivability programs. Space Systems operating income rose 6% and operating margin rate was comparable to last year at 10.2%. In addition to higher sales, space operating income also reflects the timing of favorable negotiations on certain commercial contracts in 2019. Turning to Slide 7, you can see that we have updated guidance for Aeronautics and Mission Systems. The volume impacts we are projecting at AS are associated with commercial aerostructures customers, risks in our supply chain and changes in employee attendance and productivity in certain areas. We expect that the supply chain and employee attendance impacts of COVID-19 that we began to see towards the end of March will be significant enough to impact our financial performance in certain production areas, particularly in Q2. We are also now planning for weakened commercial aerostructure demand. Commercial aerostructures represents about 1% of total company revenue and demand has declined as global travel has been impacted by the pandemic. The decrease in total company sales guidance is driven by the expected COVID-19 related impacts at AS. I would also note that our guidance continues to contemplate growth in restricted activities in manned aircraft partially offset by lower growth in F-35 due to the pandemic. We now expect sales in the low $11 billion range at Aeronautics. Regarding AS 2020 margin rate guidance, we do expect our margin rate to return to the 10% plus range in the second half of the year. We currently expect a margin rate of approximately 10% at Aeronautics this year. Based on strong Q1 performance at Mission Systems, we now expect their 2020 margin rate will be in the low to mid 14% range and will offset much of the decline in Aeronautics. Our prior guidance for Defense Systems and Space Systems sales and margin rates is unchanged. Moving to consolidated guidance on Slide 8, the update to sales guidance reflects the AS impacts we have discussed. We are reaffirming our segment operating margin rate guidance of 11.3% to 11.5% as we expect better performance at MS will largely offset margin pressure at AS. We also continue to expect total operating margin rate in the 10.8% to 11% range, with no change to unallocated corporate expense in other items. As you are aware, we issued $2.25 billion in debt in March and we now expect interest expense of $590 million. No change to expected tax rate or year end weighted average share count. Based on first quarter results and expectations for the remainder of the year, we expect mark-to-market adjusted EPS to range between $21.80 and $22.20. Slide 9 summarizes our expected COVID-19 impacts on our outlook. While there can be no assurances as to the future impacts of the pandemic, our guidance assumes that we are able to offset higher COVID-19 related costs with other cost reductions. It also assumes that supply chain and labor impacts are greatest in the second quarter and that operational pace recovers in the second half of the year. This means we currently expect the second quarter sales and margin rate will be more impacted by COVID-19 related factors than the other quarters of 2020. As Kathy said, we are maintaining our free cash flow guidance as we assume our government customers and other prime contractors will continue to make timely payments. We expect the positive impacts of higher progress payments and payroll tax benefits to offset currently anticipated COVID-19 related impacts and higher interest expense. Slide 10 provides a bridge between our January guidance and today’s full year EPS outlook. Operational impacts represent approximately $0.35 driven by the expected COVID-19 related revenue decline. We are assuming that the marketable securities loss in Q1 carries through the year and reduces our EPS by approximately $0.30. And higher interest expense as a result of our recent debt offering is expected to add another $0.30. The debt offering should give us some additional flexibility to support our customers, employees and suppliers during the pandemic and to position our company well for the long-term. We have upcoming debt maturities, including $1 billion later this year and $700 million in early 2021 and we expect to utilize excess cash to retire these. In closing, while we didn’t experience significant COVID-19 impacts in Q1 our outlook contemplates our current estimate of the potential impact for the balance of the year. We will continue to monitor the situation closely. Overall, our portfolio is well aligned with evolving customer priorities. We continue to execute to deliver value for our shareholders while managing the COVID-19 risk and we continue to invest in the future. With that, Todd, I think we are ready to open the call up for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. You may proceed with your question.
Robert Stallard: Thanks so much. Good morning.
Kathy Warden: Good morning, Rob.
Robert Stallard: A question I have on GBSD, there has been some talk that the Air Force may move a bit quicker in awarding this contract, I was wondering if this might make any sort of material impact on your results in 2020 or does this really flow through in later years? Thank you.
Kathy Warden: So, Rob, yes, we are working with the Air Force and negotiating the contract now. And we are prepared through actions we have been taking to move if the Air Force is able to accelerate this award. But it would be a modest acceleration. We anticipate the award was already planned for the quarter of this year and what we see is that it would likely be only a month or two of acceleration if acceleration happens. We don’t expect that to have a material impact on 2020, but certainly getting started more quickly de-risks the program to some extent and allows us to be more confident in meeting those milestones along the path to the 2029 IOC dates for the program.
Robert Stallard: That’s great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jon Raviv with Citi.
Jon Raviv: Thank you and good morning. Just kind of big picture here. How are you guys thinking about the business positioning on not only the current environment, but sort of what the environment is going to be going forward understanding you have a lot of products and capabilities that’s still aligned with current national defense strategy requirements. By anyway, how would you align to maybe future government spending priorities, you mentioned your work with the CDC, for example, in recent weeks, how do you think about where you aligned – where you put a line elsewhere going forward?
Kathy Warden: Well, certainly, Jon, we see the demand for our product remaining strong and that’s primarily driven by the threat environment. And I noted a few areas where we are seeing the Presidential budget for ‘21 reflect significant increases in areas like space, missile defense, hypersonics and other advanced weapons. And so those areas we expect to continue to be in focus as well as the deterrent strategy of our nation which depends on the triad and has obviously modernization happening across all three legs of the triad. So those areas are going to continue to be areas of both strength in our portfolio, but areas of importance as we look at demand near and long term. We are very pleased to be supporting the government in other areas that has become increasingly important in dealing with the pandemic. I noted the work that we’re doing currently for the CDC and we’re very proud of that work. We’ve been doing that for a number of years and while it has been relevant, previously, it’s never been as relevant as it is today. And the amount of information that we’re able to share around the globe to help people make informed decisions about this pandemic spread and how to reduce the spread is certainly something that we’ll continue to do and work that we are very proud of.
Jon Raviv: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse.
Robert Spingarn: Good morning. Kathy, I wanted to ask you just a high-level question about the budget now that we’ve had it, and what you might be hearing from the hill in terms of your programs and how they’re doing and specifically, if you could touch on Triton and the fact that that program was zeroed out at least from a procurement quantity perspective?
Kathy Warden: Thanks, Rob. So we are overall pleased with the ‘21 budget request. As I noted in the previous question, there are areas of significant budget increase that are well aligned with our priorities and certainly we were pleased to see that. We also have a number of programs that are well-supported in the budget. I noted a few of those in my opening comments, areas like SABR, E-2D, certainly F-35 continues to be well-supported as well. As we look at areas where we saw some provision on our programs, Triton being an example, what we see in the budget request is the pause in production with the intent of putting resources toward R&D on new sensor. And we had anticipated that. So it will be somewhat of an offset to the production pause, the works that we’ll do in the R&D. We also have the sale in Triton which will provide some quantity that bridge the US production pause as well. And of course we continue to work with Congress as they deliberate on the budget to determine if we can get those two aircraft added back. So those are some of the actions that we’re taking with Triton, but we do see that it is not just a production pause. This is the continued commitment to the program and investment in additional sensors to make the program and the make [Phonetic] the platform more robust.
Robert Spingarn: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.
Seth Seifman: Oh, thanks very much and good morning. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about, you mentioned higher second half margins in Aeronautics and its implied by the guidance as well. So I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more specifically about what gives you the confidence after the kind of 9%ish in Q1, and what seems like operationally it will be more challenging Q2 because of the virus, kind of, what gives you that confidence in the second half?
Dave Keffer: Hey Seth, it’s Dave. I’ll get started on that one. The – Our outlook for the year for AS margins and for total Company margins is that we expect the second half to be stronger than the first, largely because of the easing of COVID impacts in the second half, particularly compared to Q2. In AS, in particular a lot of the margin rate movement from quarter to quarter in that business is timing related. On a year-over-year basis, we saw that the timing of some risk reductions, particularly around F-35 made for a tough compare year-over-year, and we do see opportunity for greater margins going forward in that business both near and long-term than those that it delivered in the first quarter. And so, we expect that kind of strength in the second half of the year to materialize in AS. I think of it as largely timing driven around key program profit milestones and risk reductions that we see more likely coming in the second half than the first.
Seth Seifman: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Peter Arment with Baird.
Peter Arment: Yeah, thanks. Good morning, Kathy and Dave. Kathy, just you mentioned some of these supplier disruptions, or you started to see that a little bit from COVID-19. Maybe just give us a little more color on kind of your assessment of the supply chain and your confidence around whether there is alternative sources or what kind of audits you went through to kind of assess the impacts going forward? Thanks.
Kathy Warden: Yes. Thank you, Peter. As I mentioned, our supply chain management team has been very active in monitoring our supply chain for risks and mitigation strategies that can counter those risk. We have not seen significant disruption to this point, but every supplier has unique circumstances with some we have worked to enable them to continue operations by sharing best practices for social distancing and other safety protocols. With others, we have advanced payment to help with liquidity concerns as I noted in my script. And then, in addition, we have continued to monitor for disruption in the supply chain to our production lines. We’ve seen a few modest impacts at this point in time, nothing that is causing us considerable program interruption. But as I said, the Q2 impact is where we expect to see the most significant, so we’re not through the disruption at this point in time, but we are seeing positive trends both in our own facilities and with our suppliers. We are starting to see absenteeism reduce and more people coming to work in the production facilities. We are seeing small businesses that had to pause operations for a short period of time resuming their operations. And so, I would say that the trajectory is positive, but we still have uncertainty ahead.
Peter Arment: Appreciate it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Hi, good morning Kathy and welcome Dave. Kathy, a question for you please. Your overall business is set to grow at 3% to 5% this year. And given restricted is a higher proportion relative to peers, how do you think about the trajectory of restricted growth and are there areas, specific areas outside of space that you have higher confidence in the growth outlook, irrespective of what happens with the budget?
Kathy Warden: Sheila, good morning and thank you for the question. We do see restricted continuing to grow faster than the remainder of our business. And in the first quarter is just an indicator, we saw 1.3 book-to-bill in our restricted portfolio. This was largely driven by space awards as you know, we have significant restricted work across the portfolio. We’ve in the past talked a good deal about the Aeronautics restricted business, that space is also growing rapidly as is Mission Systems. And so, it really is a widespread that we are seeing that restricted growth. And we anticipate that continuing, as we look forward at opportunities that we have for the remainder of the year as well as programs in the portfolio today. And their growth rate, we anticipate that share of restricted business to continue to grow. It’s up to about 28% now and as we have previously said, we expect that to go even higher.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Strauss with Barclays.
David Strauss: Thanks. Good morning.
Kathy Warden: Good morning.
David Strauss: Kathy wanted to ask you, so you comment on the impact from commercial aerospace. I assume that’s all A350, can you just touch on that? And then on GBSD, I think you talked about $250 million in revenue this year. Can you give us some color on how that’s going to ramp over the course of the next couple of years and when does that program become bigger than B-21? Thanks.
Kathy Warden: So David, I’ll start on the question about commercial aero. Our commercial aero work is actually spread over three different efforts, the largest of which is the A350. And we are expecting the impact across all of those efforts. And we will begin to see that in Q2, but it will persist. It’s largely driven by the demand in commercial aero. And so that is why in particular, Aeronautics sector is contributing to the slight decline that we have in our revenue guide for the year. In response to your question about GBSD and the ramp, we expect that to be a gradual ramp as is the case when you start E&P contract, the engineering phase tends to be very label driven and we will be adding headcounts and driving activities over the next several years. And we wouldn’t see a peak in that program for a while. I am not going to specifically address the part of the question, but when it becomes larger than B-21. I know what you are trying to do there is give a little bit more information on B-21 than I could do. But certainly, GBSD will be a significant program in our portfolio as will B-21.
David Strauss: Okay, thanks.
Kathy Warden: Okay. Good try.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe DeNardi with Stifel.
Joe DeNardi: Hey, good morning. Kathy, can you just talk a little bit about the opportunities for the in-orbit servicing work that you are doing, I think that was a program we are not considering that Orbital was pretty excited about longer term. Are there certain milestones that you are looking for there and then just kind of what’s the optimistic scenario for what could look like eventually? Thank you.
Kathy Warden: Yes. And we continue to be excited about that opportunity. And as I noted, this award from DARPA that we received in the first quarter now will add capability to what we can do with the servicing mission. So at this point, we are able to do life extension as we are doing on the Intelsat 901 satellite with our first operation, but the robotic servicing will allow us to provide other servicing functionality. So it opens up the market in that regard and clearly is an indicator that we would be able to service not only commercial, but potentially government satellites as well. So when we look at the market, we are bullish, but cautious and that this is the first of a kind and we want to continue to march through milestones of succession that would lead us to believe that we can accomplish this much broader set of servicing missions that certainly life extensions servicing which we have already accomplished with the Intelsat satellite is something we feel comfortable will be a robust and growing market for us.
Joe DeNardi: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Harnett with Bernstein.
Doug Harnett: Yes. Good morning. Thank you. In the new organization structure and I am interested in understand what – how this works now, in other words, those in terms of the costs you are still working through on integration, but then also in the structure what should we now see as the benefits going forward? And I would say that on two sides, one in revenue synergies and the other in the ability to actually improve margins a little bit as you look at the next couple of years?
Kathy Warden: So Doug, certainly with the integration that we are doing, we have already met our cost targets for the integration of Orbital ATK. And the next logical step that we took at the beginning of this year was realigning the sector structure, we see continued opportunity for cost reduction through the new sector alignment and that is a clear objective that we had for doing that realignments at the beginning of this year one of the other and I would say that more important is the ability to capture the revenue synergy and successfully execute on those programs. So that is the primary reason why we took the new sector alignment, but certainly, cost reduction was also a part of our objective help for the team. And I am pleased with the progress that we are making there as a matter of fact as we look at this year we have some increased COVID-19 related costs as company does as we do more of the safety protocols, cleaning, social distancing and we fully expect as we have said in our guidance that we can offset those through other cost reduction measures that we anticipate taking this year. So we are looking ahead and believe that not only the sector realignment, but actions that we will continue to take as the sector is operate in this new structure will allow us some cost reduction opportunities. Dave, anything else you would like to add?
Dave Keffer: As you mentioned, Doug, we are going through the standard process now around realigning systems and rate pools and such kind of on the administrative side of the realignment. But I think the bigger picture Kathy mentions is the important one which is that the realignment enables both top line synergy going forward as well as further improvements in cost management around the business and that those are timely given the environment we find ourselves in, in 2020.
Doug Harnett: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Myles Walton with UBS.
Myles Walton: Thanks. Good morning. Kathy, I wanted to hone in on a comment you made about hiring actually, which was 10,000 jobs unfilled that were posted and 3,500 hires in the first quarter. On a 90,000 employee base, I’m just wondering how much of this is going to be net growth and should we use that as a calibration as to the speed of revenue growth, as you look into 2021? Thanks.
Kathy Warden: Thanks, Myles. So, as we look at our hiring, we have a number of open positions both to support existing business, but also anticipation of future awards. So I would tell you that we only do that hiring if we indeed get those awards as we look forward. So, open positions are not necessarily a direct correlation to the number of hires that we will ultimately make. And as we look at this year in particular, we go into a year with an assumption around attrition. So that gets us to net head, and the labor market was very tight at the beginning of this year. As we are working through the last two months, we’re seeing that attrition is dropping as you might expect as other opportunities are becoming more scarce. And so, we are in the process of looking at what that may present, it’s both challenge and opportunity for us going forward. And so, we are actively working on hiring and being very successful in hiring as I noted. Still even as we were dealing with the challenges of the pandemic in March, we saw 1,300 plus hires and April continues to also be strong where we’ve moved to virtual as you might expect to accommodate most of that hiring. And so, as we look forward, the net head, I wouldn’t put a number on it, but we do expect significant headcount growth this year because of the program volume increases that we have, the sales growth as well as the anticipated awards in the latter half of this year.
Myles Walton: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Carter Copeland with Melius Research.
Carter Copeland: Hey, good morning. I wondered if you could just expand briefly on the hiring. It looks like obviously the classified portion of the business is increasing in its share. And I wondered if you might just speak to what portion of that hiring that you mentioned, the 10,000 jobs is cleared personnel and maybe just give us a sense of, if there is a challenge given the growth in restricted work that you expect in terms of getting either clear personnel on or getting folks hired and then getting them cleared, just help us understand kind of that dynamic and how you are dealing with it? Thanks.
Kathy Warden: Thanks, Carter. Yes, a significant portion of that hiring is for cleared personnel. We don’t always hire an individual who is already cleared. We have other opportunities that we are able to put people on while they await their clearance. And we’ve also seen the department take actions that have accelerated clearance processing. And those have been very helpful. We still obviously have a waiting period for those individuals, but it is getting shorter through the actions that the government is taking. And so, what we do is, we do both hiring of individuals who already have clearance directly onto those restricted programs as well as pipelining through our unclassified work with the intention of moving those individuals on restricted programs once their clearance comes through. And we have been doing that for years, and it has worked well for us, it’s not something that’s driving an inordinate amount of increased costs to our business because we have this portfolio, that has so much both unclassified and classified work. And I’ll note that classification is relative to their different levels, of clearances required and so people can step through those clearance levels as well.
Carter Copeland: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.
Cai von Rumohr: Yes. Thank you very much. So, could you give us any color on the significant classified space awards in the first quarter? And secondly, you know, it was a little stronger for first quarter in terms of total bookings than maybe some of us expected. Where do you see the backlog going by year end and what are the key drivers to get it there?
Kathy Warden: So, Cai, in terms of backlog for the year, we still anticipate it to be above one even without GBSD. Clearly GBSD, we expect to be a sizable award if we receive it. And so, that would drive book to bill well above one. As we look at the first quarter, we did have less than one book to bill, but we had anticipated, that as you said and it signals that we expected, most of our significant awards to happen later in the year. We did have the large space restricted awards that we noted. And while we can’t provide any detail about what they are, who they are for, or the value of them, they were ones that we have been working for a period of time and did anticipate getting, but they were competitive. So we clearly had factored them to some extent in our plans for the year and we are very pleased to be selected and awarded those contracts for the quarter.
Cai von Rumohr: Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.
Hunter Keay: Hey, good morning.
Kathy Warden: Good morning.
Hunter Keay: Thank you. So I was wondering, if you could follow up to the exchange we had with Doug earlier. I’m kind of curious about – can you maybe give me some examples or even better quantify the amount of costs you’re taking out specifically from coronavirus and this is obviously primarily an Aerospace conversation, how many of those – how much of those costs can you actually keep out once you resume normal production rates? And again, if you could maybe quantify the margin potential, just basically trying to figure out if you can use this as an opportunity to take out cost that you wanted to take out before and maybe keep them out, if you understand. Thank you.
Dave Keffer: So, I’ll be happy to start on that one, Hunter. It’s tough to quantify that specific volumes of cost take out that are possible both near-term and then on a permanent basis as you mentioned. Certainly, there is an opportunity to reduce costs during the pandemic related to travel and conferences and trade shows and other kind of low hanging fruit like that, that are naturally declining in the business. And we’ll look to harvest those cost savings and continue to manage those areas throughout the rest of the year. But then, we’re also taking this opportunity to look around at the business and find other areas of efficiency. Kathy has been clear over the past year about driving increased efficiencies, strong performance around the business, being an agile Company that moves quickly and reduces bureaucracy. And so, that’s part and parcel of what we’re looking at today and that’s not in any one sector more than others nor more than at the corporate level. At all levels we’re taking a look at those opportunities. The margin impacts will depend to a degree on the business mix by segment. And so, those that have more cost-plus work have less margin impact, but greater impact on the competitiveness of their businesses as we look for opportunities to take out cost. So those are different impact depending on the segment, but a broad Company effort to drive that efficiency this year.
Hunter Keay: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.
Noah Poponak: Hey, good morning everybody.
Kathy Warden: Hi, Noah.
Noah Poponak: Just want to make sure I fully understand all the moving pieces and the Aeronautics margin in the quarter. In the release it cites the EAC move in autonomous, F-35 risk retirement and then some mix. Is it may be possible to size those in terms of how much of the year-over-year change came from each of them? Was there any one-time kind of charge related to the commercial aerospace pieces? Just want to fully understand that year-over-year change. And then, if you have any thoughts you could share on where that segment’s profitability can go longer term three years to five years out, would love to hear that. Thank you.
Dave Keffer: Sure. Thanks Noah. I’ll get started on that one. The two buckets you mentioned were approximately even in overall size. What I think is important to note is that, no one specific program had a material enough impact to be called out individually. And so year-over-year, it was a tough compare quarter for AS given that there was, the timing of some of those risk reductions in last year’s Q1 created a tough compare. But in this year’s Q1, there were pressures on a few programs, fewer upsides on others than we might typically see in a given quarter, again much of that is timing related, and we try to take that into account as we look at the rest of the year. I think the other thing that’s important to note there is, in a more typical year, we would have expected to see more opportunity to mitigate those Q1 challenges in Q2 through Q4. But of course, our timing is increasingly short there given the impacts of the COVID pandemic on Q2, particularly in the volume pressures that we’re seeing in AS. And so that makes it more difficult to mitigate those Q1 pressures than a typical year would provide.
Kathy Warden: And Noah, on your question about the longer term and where we think AS margins can go. Certainly, all things being equal, we expect three years to five years out to have a higher production mix than we have today, because we have some significant development program in Aeronautics as we sit here today. And that would naturally create opportunity for margin improvement during that period.
Noah Poponak: Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.
George Shapiro: Yes, good morning. I had wanted to know, the expectation has been that your sales would grow faster than other people. But it hasn’t happened that way. Can you point to some inflection point or what quarter or year we might start to see the sales growth to better than others or much better than the budget that’s going to decline over the next several years?
Kathy Warden: So, you know, George, I wouldn’t want to try to predict a quarter, at which point we would see an inflection compared to peers because I don’t have the insight into our peers. I do feel like we’ve performed well relative to the market. We have increased our competitive win rate and that’s a strong indicator of performance in the competitive marketplace. We have also shown significant improvement in our backlog and we’re pleased with where it sits and also have a number of opportunities that we’ve outlined to build that backlog this year, and we anticipate doing so. So, what I really focus on is looking forward, how are we positioned regardless of what defense budget do in this country and around the globe. Do we have a portfolio that’s well aligned to the highest growth areas? And the answer to that is yes, as we sit here today and we believe will continue to be areas of exposure like the strategic deterrence programs that – in the case of B-21, we’ve already captured, in the case of GBSD we anticipate being awarded later this year. In the case of Space, which is the fastest growing in the President’s ‘21 budget for this year, we certainly have good exposure with hypersonics and other advanced weapons now in the portfolio and expect that we can continue to grow off of what is today a small base, but an area where we expect to have significant demand. And we believe those areas of demand will be key regardless of what the top line budget looks like, because they are based on the advancement of our adversaries capabilities and the threats that they impose. So based on that, we feel positive about how our portfolio is positioned for growth. And we anticipate that we can continue to create strong shareholder value through that growth, successful execution and turning that into earnings.
Todd Ernst: Operator, we have time for one more question.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question comes from Ron Epstein with Bank of America.
Ron Epstein: Yes, good morning everyone. Kathy…
Kathy Warden: Hi, Ron.
Ron Epstein: There has been discussion in the industrial policy office in the DoD about accelerating progress payments and then getting that pushed down in the supply chain. How is that impacting you, and when you think about your supply base, particularly those suppliers who have significant commercial aerospace businesses, do you worry about disruptions there and how are you handling that?
Kathy Warden: Yes, Ron. We have seen the impact of the increase in progress payments to 90% that the Department has offered. And we are flowing that full supplier benefit down to our suppliers in a timely fashion. And as I noted earlier in my comments, in addition to that, we are also doing some advances for suppliers paying in advance, because we want to help them with the challenges they are having, particularly those suppliers that straddle both defense programs and commercial aerospace programs. And so we believe that our suppliers are well supported by us today, but we monitor that on a daily basis, because it’s an evolving situation for them, particularly those that are exposed on that demand side to the commercial aero market.
Dave Keffer: And what I would add to that is we have fewer progress payment contracts than some of our similarly sized peers do and that we are being sure to quickly flow through to our suppliers their portion of that benefit. So, when you aggregate the net benefit to Northrop Grumman certainly we appreciate the work of our customers to increase that benefit, but it doesn’t change our cash flow guidance for the year. The upside we have some additional benefit from the progress payments as well as potential tax benefits we mentioned on the call. And offsetting those, we have the impacts of COVID that we discussed to include the interest on the new bond. So, that keeps us in the same range of cash flow that we were projecting previously.
Ron Epstein: Okay, great. Thank you.
Todd Ernst: Alright, great. Well, thank you. I now turn it over to Kathy for closing comments.
Kathy Warden: Thanks, Todd. Well, I am very pleased to have Dave on our team and helping to lead through the challenges of the pandemic. We and the entire Northrop Grumman team remain resolute in managing through these challenges and being well-positioned for the future. So, we look forward to speaking with you again in July. And until then, please stay well.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2019 Q4  (2020-01-30 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Northrop Grumman's Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2019 Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. My name is Regina, and I will be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Todd Ernst, Treasurer and Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Ernst, please proceed.
Todd Ernst: Thank you, Regina and good morning everyone. Welcome to Northrop Grumman's fourth quarter and full year 2019 conference call. We will refer to conference slide that are posted on our IR website this morning. Before we start, matters discussed on today's call including 2019 guidance and beyond reflect the company's judgment based on information available at the time of this call. They constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities Laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which are noted in today's earnings release and our SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties may also because actual company results to differ materially. Matters discussed on today's call include non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled in our earnings release and supplemental PowerPoint presentation. Our GAAP results reflect the mark-to-market method of accounting for our pension and other post-retirement benefits. For consistency and comparability of our results in 2020 guidance, our references to adjusted net earnings and adjusted earnings per share on today's call will refer to earnings and EPS adjusted for mark-to-market impact. These are non-GAAP measures. Our earnings release contained a reconciliation of these non-GAAP operating majors to our GAAP results. On today's call are Kathy Warden, our Chairman, CEO and President, and Ken Bedingfield, our CFO. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kathy. Kathy?
Kathy Warden: Thank you, Todd. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. We had a strong fourth quarter and good finish to the year. I want to thank the Northrop Grumman team for their continued focus on performance, innovation and agility. It's the dedication of our employees to these priorities that enables us to meet the commitments we make to our shareholders and our customers. Turning to our results, we met our guidance for segment OM and exceeded our adjusted EPS and cash guidance. Our new business capture drove a 21% backlog increase in 2019, providing a strong foundation for future growth. 2019 sales grew 12% to $33.8 billion benefiting from a full year of innovation system, as well as continued growth at Aerospace Systems and Mission Systems. Full year sales reflect double-digit growth on the F-35 program and growth in restricted activities at all four sectors. Restricted work accounted for more than a quarter of 2019 sales, a double-digit increased over 2018. Our segment margin rate for the year increased to 11.6%. Strong program performance and cost synergies more than offset margin pressure from early phase development work. Adjusted earnings per share also exceeded guidance at $21.21 for the year. Turning to cash, I want to congratulate the team on a very strong year. Fourth quarter cash from operations totaled $2.5 billion, and free cash flow was approximately $2 billion. For the full year, cash from operations increased to $4.3 billion and free cash flow was more than $3 billion exceeding the top of our guidance range. Strong cash enabled effective capital deployment. We invested $1.3 billion in our businesses through capital expenditures, strengthened our balance sheet by retiring $500 million of debt and return $1.6 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We increased our quarterly dividend by 10% last May and reduce their weighted average share count by approximately 3%. Business capture was a key highlight of 2019 performance. Net awards totaled more than $45 billion- or 1.3-times sales, and we delivered double-digit backlog growth at all four sectors. At the macro level, defense spending continues to be a national priority. The fiscal year 2020 investment accounts are up 3% to $251 billion. This increase shows the emphasis being placed on modernization, as called for in the national defense strategy. The development of capabilities to counter peer adversaries continues to be a priority. Our customers are increasingly focused on rapidly evolving multi domain peer threats in areas like space, hypersonics and missile defense. Our growing share of restricted work demonstrates that our customers are turning to Northrop Grumman for these capabilities. In 2019, restricted awards totalled nearly $11 billion with approximately $7 billion for restricted space. In addition to restricted awards, we receive several multi-billion-dollar awards for large legacy franchise programs like F-35 and E2D. We also received awards to transition development programs like Triton, GATOR, IBCS and Kirkum [ph] to work full rate production. We're also pursuing and winning the early phase development work that is the seed corn for the next generation of franchise program.
ER, : On January 1st of this year, we began operating in a new sector structure to further align our unique capabilities in space, missile, counter hypersonics, cyber and stealth. It's the next logical step after the acquisition of Orbital ATK to enable capture of revenue synergy and drive profitable growth. In the new structure, we're bringing together and integrating the relevant capabilities to solve many of the nation's toughest problem. We also introduced our new defining profitable brand, to reinforce the value we're providing through performance, agility, and innovation. Discovery and innovation are at the heart of what we do. We show our customers what is possible, and then deliver through performance framework and culture that balance agility and affordability with quality and safety. We're investing in innovative concepts and technologies that align with the priorities of our customers. I'm pleased with the progress we are making. And I'll share four examples of demonstrations we completed in the fourth quarter, each of which offers innovation to support our customer's vision for future operation. First, as we work closely with the Department on the joint all domain command and control effort, we are leveraging our experience with the Army's IBCS. We recently conducted a successful test using air and ground-based sensors against multiple fast-moving airborne targets. We are using agile development methods to integrate sensors and the sectors to rapidly and more precisely address new complex threats. Second, we participated in the first advanced battle management systems demonstration using feeds for multiple domains to find, track and destroy cruise missiles. Here we integrated the communication suite necessary to connect the F-22 and the F-35 platform enabling this integrated battle management solution. A third example is our development and integration of a world record 150-kilowatt class high energy laser weapon system on board the USS Portland. The laser system is undergoing final verification testing before deploying later this year, at which time the Navy will gain apps [ph] experience with directed energy systems in support, the future fleet operations. And lastly, we successfully flight tested a rapid prototype conventionally configured hypersonic ground launched ballistic missile in response to an urgent capability request from DoD. The launch vehicle met a highly aggressive eight months design, integration and launch schedule achieving flawless flight results. These accomplishments are the results of our investments to address our customers emerging requirements with the ability they require. These investments are solid 2019 financial results and successful business capture provided strong foundation for continued growth and sustained performance. Our 2020 guidance called for sales to grow to between $35.3 billion and $35.8 billion with a segment operating margin rate of 11.3% to 11.5%. We expect 2020 adjusted EPS will range between $22.75, and $23.15. After capital spending of approximately $1.35 billion, we expect free cash flow of $3.15 billion to $3.45 billion. 2020 guidance contemplates that we are selected for the next phase of the GBSD program in accordance with the Air Force's current acquisition Timeline, which calls for an award in August. We submitted our proposal in December, and we are in active discussions with the Air Force as they work through this Force selection process. We are continuing to perform well on the technology maturation and risk reduction phase of the contract. And together with our nationwide team, we are investing in technologies and facilities necessary to be ready for day one of EMD. We anticipate the EMD phase of this multi-billion-dollar decade long recapitalization of the nation's ICBM to sub capability would be accretive to 2020 sales and slightly dilutive to OM rate, as well as free cash flow due to higher capital expenditures. Ken will review the detailed guidance for the sectors, but I wanted to provide some context around 2020 sector performance. First, sector guidance under the new structure is consistent with the trends we've been talking about in our businesses. We expect space systems will be our fastest growing sector. Beyond 2020 in addition to GBSD we have large opportunities in Space 3 architecture, hypersonics, intermediate range ballistic missiles and national safe launch. In civil space, we're well aligned for NASA's Artemis program. For Aeronautics System, we have resident technology and integration expertise and critical domains like stealth and autonomy to support growth over the long-term. On an apples-to-apples basis, the businesses comprising aeronautics grew backlog 24% in 2019, which provides a solid foundation for sustained growth. For Mission Systems, competitive opportunities in airborne and ground-based radar system create opportunity for enhanced growth. In addition, Mission Systems advanced capabilities and domain expertise, are key competitive differentiators that we leverage across the entire company as we pursued new business. Mission Systems to continue to have attractive top line growth coupled with strong margin rates. And for Defense System, over the long-term, key growth drivers include high speed weaponry programs like AARGM-ER and our C2 and cross domain C2 program. We expect stable to growing revenue from legacy technology services businesses, as they're focused on the defense and intelligence market continue to generate results. So, in summary, we have strong performance in 2019 and we expect continued top-line growth and sustained performance in 2020 and beyond. We also expect continued strong cash generation that will support our capital deployment strategy and create value for our shareholders and customers. I'll turn the call over to Ken now for a more detailed discussion of our financial results, guidance and trends. Ken?
Ken Bedingfield: Thanks, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. I also want to congratulate the team on strong performance this year. I'll spend a few minutes on 2019 results and discuss our 2020 guidance in more detail. We will be providing guidance in our news sector structure with some broad year-over-year trend information. Our first quarter earnings release in April will include a schedule that recast prior period results for comparison. Referring to slides five and six in our PowerPoint deck, I'll turn to sector results. Airspace System sales rose 10% for the quarter and 6% for the year, largely due to higher levels of restricted activity. In addition, sales were higher in both periods for all three business areas. Restricted activities, F-35 production increases and higher E-2D volume where the growth drivers at manned aircraft. Next gen OPIR activities where a growth driver at space, autonomous systems reflect higher volume across several programs, including Global Hawk and Triton. AS operating income increased by 9% in the quarter and 2% for the full year. Fourth quarter operating margin rate was comparable to last year. 2019 operating margin rate of 10.3% reflects lower net favorable EAC adjustments related to several programs nearing completion. Turning to innovation systems, fourth quarter sales rose 9% and full year sales increased 10% on a pro forma basis. Sales were higher at all three business areas for both periods. In space this was driven by higher volume for national security satellite systems. At flight systems fourth quarter growth reflects higher volume on propulsion systems and full year results reflect increased volume on aerostructures and launch vehicles. Higher volume on tactical missiles and subsystems including GMLRS and our new AARGM-ER program drove higher defense sales in both periods. Fourth quarter operating income increased 20% due to improve performance at flight systems and space systems. For the full year, operating income totaled $671 million or 11% margin rate, which exceeded our guidance. Turning to mission systems, fourth quarter and full year sales rose 6% and 5% respectively. Like AS and IS all three business areas within mission systems had higher sales in both periods. At advanced capabilities, higher volume for restricted activities and Marine systems drove growth in both periods. And the fourth quarter also benefited from higher volume on Poland IBCS as that program ramps up. Growth at cyber and ISR was driven by higher volume for space and restricted programs. And at sensors and processing, fourth quarter growth reflects higher volume for airborne radar programs. For the full year, sensors and processing sales growth is being driven by higher volume for airborne radars and new restricted programs. Mission system, fourth quarter operating income rose 13% and operating margin rate increased in 90 basis points to 14%. For the full year, operating income rose 8% and operating margin rate increased 40 basis points to 13.4% exceeding our guidance. Mission systems margin rate reflects improved performance on advanced capabilities and sensors and processing programs as well as a $20 million gain on sale of property. Technology services fourth quarter and full year 2019 sales were 4% lower as expected. Fourth quarter 2018 sales included an approximately $30 million favorable EAC adjustment for completion of an IT outsourcing contract. The 2019 year over year revenue comparison was negatively impacted by this adjustment and completion of the GRDC and KC10 programs partially offset by growth in other programs. Technology services, fourth quarter operating income declined 8% and operating margin rate was 10.4% again, the quarter over quarter comparison reflects with favorable Q4 2018 impacted by items related to the close out of the state IT outsourcing contract. For 2019 operating income increased 3% and operating margin rates increased 80 basis points to 11.1% exceeding our high 10% guidance. At the total company level 2019 segment operating income increased 13% to $3.9 billion and segment operating margin rate was 11.6% versus our mid-11% guidance. Total operating income was approximately $4 billion with an operating margin rate of 11.7% this was largely due to unallocated corporate expense which came in lower than we expected due to an $89 million benefit for resolution of a cost claim accounting matter, which was not contemplated in our guidance. A couple of comments on our mark to market adjustment, our discount rate declined 92 basis points to 3.39% which drove a $4 billion increase in our pension liability. We also changed our assumptions to reflect updated society of actuaries’ mortality data, as well as an updated evaluation of our plan population. This increased our pension liability by $800 million. These increases were partially offset by plan asset returns that exceeded assumptions, increasing assets by approximately 3 billion. So that's how we get to the $1.8 billion pretax expense. Our cash prepayment credit is approximately $1.6 billion as of January 1st of this year. Turning to cash as is our typical pattern, we had a strong fourth quarter. For the year cash from operations was approximately $4.3 billion and after capital expenditures of about $1.25 billion, our free cash flow grew 18% to more than $3 billion exceeding our guidance. Now, looking ahead to 2020, I'll mention that our news sector and reporting structure is laid out on Slide 11 of the PowerPoint deck. I'll refer you to a discussion of sector guidance on slide 12. At Aeronautics Systems, we expect solid mid-single-digit sales growth to the mid to high $11 billion range with a low to mid 10% margin rate, stable versus 2019. About half of the 2020 sales growth is expected from a restricted program in manned aircraft. And we also expect mid-single-digit growth on the F-35 program. For defense systems, we expect sales to be comparable to 2019 in the mid-$7 billion range, as Lake City transition offsets growth and other areas of the business. We expect an operating margin rate in the mid-10% range up slightly from 2019. At the new mission system sector, we expect solid mid-single-digit sales growth to the high $9 billion range with a low 14% margin rate. Sales growth is supported by F-35 activities and production ramps and GATOR, Kirkum [ph] SABR as well as restricted development work. The 2020 margin rate expectation at MS is down slightly due to the $20 million gain on property sale in 2019. And the changing mix that reflects a growing percentage of development work. At Space Systems, we expect low-double-digit sales growth to the low $8 billion range with a low to mid 10% margin rate. This represents continued strong margin rate performance. I would note that Space System sales and margin rate guidance contemplate more early phase development work, including GBSD, which is expected to be accretive to sales, but slightly diluted to the margin rate of the existing portfolio. Our sector guidance rolls up to 2020 sales of $35.3 billion to $35.8 billion. And I would note that under the new structure, we expect inner segment eliminations to decline to about $1.8 billion. I would point out the first quarter 2020 sales are expected to be a bit less than 25% of full year sales. As Mission Systems and Space Systems revenue is weighted towards the second half of the year. We expect segment operating margin rate of 11.3% to 11.5%. We expect 2020, total operating margin rate will range between 10.8% and 11% reflecting $390 million for the operating portion of the net FAS/CAS pension benefit, and unallocated corporate expense of approximately $565 million, which includes $315 million non-cash and tangible asset amortization and PP&E step-up depreciation and $250 million of other estimated unallocated items. Moving to pension, slide 13 provides our 2020 pension assumptions. These assumptions exclude any 2020 mark-to-market impact. Slide 14 summarizes our pension estimates for years '20 through 2022. And slide 15 summarizes sensitivities to changes to our 2020 assumptions. Our guidance systems $500 million of interest expense, de minimis interest income and an effective tax rate of approximately 16.5%. I'll remind you that our 2019 reported effective tax rate reflected the mark-to-market expense. So, please don't use that as a baseline as you think about our 2020 effective tax rate. Based on all that, we expect adjusted earnings per share will increase to a range of $22.75 to $23.15, or about 8% growth at the midpoint. EPS growth reflects higher sales and higher segment operating income, as well as pension benefit, partially offset by higher corporate unallocated expense and a higher tax rate. I'd also note EPS guidance is based on $168 million weighted average shares outstanding, a reduction from 2019 of about 1% for 2020 after capital expenditures of approximately $1.35 billion. We expect free cash flow will range between $3.15 billion and $3.45 billion or about 9% growth at the midpoint. CapEx includes the required early capital investment for GBSD. And we expect the cash flows will continue to be heavily weighted to the second half of the year. I'll also mention that our cash continues to be driven significantly by operations with net pension defined as CAS less funding, expected to be about 11% at the midpoint of implied 2020 cash from operations. Our capital deployment strategy continues to call for investing in our businesses, strengthening of the balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders through share repurchases and a competitive dividend. In addition, we do have $1 billion of debt maturing this fall, which we are currently planning to retire. In summary, we expect to continue strong value creation through a combination of growth, performance, and robust cash generation as well as thoughtful capital allocation. I think we're ready for Q&A. Todd?
Todd Ernst: Regina, please open the line for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of the Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.
Seth Seifman: Okay, thanks very much. Good morning. So, I just wanted to ask, maybe one question Ken about working capital. Like very strong performance in the quarter and, whether you expect working capital to grow in 2020. It looks like it was maybe even down a hair in 2019. And whether, you think you can keep it flat or not. And then, secondly you mentioned the $1.6 billion CAS credit and it looks like over the next three years that pretty much gets eaten up. And so, should we assume in the out years beyond your forecast that CAS contributions are roughly in line?
Ken Bedingfield: Sure. Thanks, Seth. I'll start with the working capital question and then head to pension. I would say from a working capital perspective, we did have better than expected performance in 2019. We've been really focused on working capital and trying to maximize the benefit there. And we did see that that performance exceeded our expectations and 2019. So, we're pleased about that. As we look at our ability to generate cash in 2020. We're certainly looking at kind of the growth of the company, the strong margin profile, delivering the ability to convert that margin into cash as the primary driver of the cash flow growth. But certainly, managing working capital as efficiently as possible will be a part of that as well. So, I think that, from a working capital perspective, it's something where it's not going to be a headwind. We don't necessarily expect the continued tailwind that we had in 2019. But as we look at 2020, I think that strong growth and converting our margins in the cash is probably the biggest driver of cash. And again, strong performance by the team in 2018 and we look forward to maximizing again in 2020. From a pension perspective, you're correct Seth. The current assumptions on pension would result in the prepayment credit getting burned down in 2022. And that would therefore result in CAS and funding being pretty similar as we look beyond 2022. And I would just comment that, as we look at the pension assumptions, we've laid out for 2021 and 2022. We've got a scenario where generally the cash - net pension cash, CAS less funding is relatively in a box, I would say. There's not a lot of a lot worse it can get. You'll notice that in 2022 CAS is about 150-160 greater than funding that would say that as we look at our performance, it is kind of in a box. And on the opportunity side, if we can outperform or other assumptions change, then we have the ability to drive down that 22 funding that is required under the current assumptions.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ronald Epstein with Bank of America.
Todd Ernst: Operator, please clear the line with Ron. It's been static.
Operator: The line has been cleared. Your next question will come from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Thank you very much. Kathy, you mentioned restricted - the restricted portfolio is about a quarter of the business and it grew double-digits in 2019 so you're clearly taking share. How long do you think that's sustainable? And what are parts of the business that are may be underperforming your expectations and do they expect to pick up?
Kathy Warden: Thanks, Sheila. I did mention restricted being our key growth area, both in our sales in 2019, as well as the awards that we received with $11 billion awards and $7 billion of that coming in restricted states. So, we clearly still see space being a growth driver for us into the future. And we also had noted in our third quarter call that we had received $1.3 billion in awards and hypersonic, we continue to see that as a growth area for the business as well. And I mentioned in my comments today, a demonstration that we conducted in the fourth quarter and hypersonic missiles as well. So, those are a couple of the areas that I would notice key growth drivers going forward in our restricted portfolio. As I look across the business, we clearly have headwinds as we exit the Lake City contract. This year, we have noted us about 300 million of headwinds in 2020. We basically now have exited the small caliber business. And so that's a headwind that will largely be behind us as we get past 2020. And so as we look at Aerospace Mission Systems and space, we see strong growth expected in each of those sectors, Aeronautics ambition, in the mid to high-single-digit space to low-double-digits, its defense systems where we have those Lake City headwinds that we see more of a stable growth profile, but really not looking at any part of the portfolio was under performing with those headwind the exception as more caliber.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Great, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from a line of a Peter Arment with Baird.
Peter Arment: Yes. Good morning, Kathy and Ken. Kathy, just kind of going back to the legacy innovation systems segment. I know it's now obviously space, but, we've been tracking the kind of the synergy number that you had laid out previously. And then also the revenue synergy, I think was something that originally wasn't a number that got quoted, but maybe just talk about some of the opportunities you're seeing there and how that's progressing? Thanks.
Kathy Warden: We'll do. Thanks Peter. So, in costs energy, I noted in my comments that we exceeded their cost synergy target in 2019. And that helped us to generate higher than expected segment operating margin rate. So that area of commitment is certainly one, where we feel, we did what we said we were going to do and even had some opportunity to over perform in driving costs out of the business. And that not only generates near-term margin, but it also helps us to position the business more competitively to win in the future, which gets to the part of your question around revenue synergy. We have been realized the revenue synergy ahead of the estimates we had in by plan for the Orbital ATK business. And we see that continuing as we look into the future. I had noted previously that space and missiles are the two areas where we are seeing the greatest synergy and I gave a few examples in each including AARGM-ER which I talked about again today and the opportunity that we see there not just domestically, but also internationally. We still see those two areas space and missile seeing the ones that will be the key drivers of revenue synergy over the plan.
Operator: Your next question comes from over Robert Stallard with Vertical Research.
Robert Stallard: Thanks so much. Good morning.
Ken Bedingfield: Good morning, Rob.
Robert Stallard: Ken, quick question for you on capital deployment. You commented that you intend to pay off a billion dollars of debt later this year. I certainly could work walk us through the thinking on that, because obviously, with interest rates being very low, you've already got a strong balance sheet. Would it not make sense to keep the debt, refinance the debt and perhaps return more cash to shareholders?
Ken Bedingfield: Sure. Let me walk through that. And as we look at 2020 and our capital deployment plans. We continue to think about it in the same way we have historically and that is invest in the business, which we're doing in 2020, including what we expect to invest in GBSD, as Kathy talked about. Certainly, paying a competitive dividend. And then also managing the balance sheet and share repurchase. And we've got an amount of repurchase that we're planning for 2020 and with that, behind us, we've got the cash to pay off the debt. As we look forward, there's more debt that's coming due and we'll certainly evaluate whether or not we continue to delever through paying off debt where we just delever through growing our EBITDA. And I wouldn't necessarily assume that because we're paying off the 2020 debt that means that we're going to continue to pay off more debt, we've got optionality and obviously we'll continue to evaluate what the best use of the cash is, as we look at all those options, the capital deployment. But we're in a good position of with our strong cash flow being able to deploy all of those avenues of capital deployment.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss with Barclays.
David Strauss: Thanks, good morning.
Ken Bedingfield: Good morning, David.
David Strauss: Want to ask about CapEx. It sounds like GBSD is adding a bit to that to this year, maybe 50 basis points as a percent of sales. I think you previously talked about CapEx stepping down in 2021 to like 2.5% of sales. How does GBSD kind of impact that, Ken? Thanks.
Ken Bedingfield: Sure, let me start on that one. From a CapEx perspective, we were at 3.7% of revenue in 2019. We had talked about the profile that we were expecting, as we were looking forward into 2020 and 2021. For 2020, we have updated our outlook to include GBSD that's for CapEx as well as revenue, certainly at the high end of the guide. And, that was not included in the numbers that we talked about last fall. So, the GBSD now included, we're looking at CapEx of about $1.35 billion for 2020 and probably $1.35 billion for 2021. And then kind of continuing to decrease so the percentage of sales beyond that. And I maybe would also just note that, as we look at 2020, we do have the CapEx in for GBSD and only maybe $250 million or so of sales given the award, expected to come in August.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse.
Robert Spingarn: Hi, good morning.
Kathy Warden: Good morning.
Robert Spingarn: Kathy, this one's I thought I'd ask you about open architecture, which I think you've discussed in the past. What I was wondering if you might walk through how you're positioning Northrop to benefit from do these increased emphases on that design paradigm. And, do you think you can leverage that to drive market share gains at Mission Systems over the long-term?
Kathy Warden: Thanks for the question. I'm glad that you picked up on that Rob, because we have been talking about it for a while, particularly as we discussed, what we have done on IBCS as a program, but I've also talked about that being more of an architecture. And we're now beginning to demonstrate that to the Department of Defense as we participated in demos in the fourth quarter, at least two of them. The one I noted around IBCS, for joint all domain command and control, as well as the one that we did to connect F-22 and F-35 in communications to enable the battle command system. So as we think about what the future holds, the ability to have an architecture that rapidly integrate both sensors and the sectors, and allows the department to tie these systems that have been built in more of a stovepipe fashion to communicate and to share information will be critical to their vision for future operations. And we are able to rapidly do this because we have been working for in these open architectures for a number of years. And we have ready to go solutions that enable this demonstration of capability.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jon Raviv with Citi.
Jon Raviv: Good morning, everyone. Just thinking about GBSD being a major change, I think, from the 3Q outlook in the fall, I think you talked on mid-single digit sales and flat margin, your GBSD is less than 1% of sales, but second largest now down in 2020. Can you just sort of put all those pieces together for us and sort of add a little more color as to what's going on with 2020 versus what you said in the fall and then really with the opportunity to accelerate on simply GBSD going forward. Thank you.
Ken Bedingfield: Sure. John, let me, let me start on that one. I would say that as we look at 2020, based on the guide that we've laid out, you call it 4.5% to 6% or so growth given the range and again, that does include a GBSD, proceeding as expected in the August timeframe. From a margin perspective, I would say that as we think about it, in the new sector structure, again aeronautics would be relatively comparable to 2019. Space Systems would be down a little bit some of that is GBSD and some of that is just other mix changes as it continues to win new business and take on additional development work. And as we've talked about a low double-digit growth rate there at Space Systems. At MS, we did have the property gain in 2019. So, we see that as having a little bit of an impact on margins at MS, we mentioned that would result in a little bit of a margin, reduction into 2020, on a comparative basis. And then at the new defense systems, we are projecting that margin will be slightly up and as that business performs well. So, you know, look, we always incentivize the team to perform and to outperform our peers and we look forward to a 2020 where the team will hopefully continue to step up to the challenge as I've seen them do and drive the best margin outcome that we can get to.
Kathy Warden: And Jon, I believe the second part of your question was around the possibility of acceleration of award on GBSD. So, let me just comment briefly on that. As you know, the air force has made it clear that GBSD needs to be in fielding in 2029 and that the time to do so is short. And it's essential that we get started on the critical requirement. So, we've been investing in the people in facilities that we need to ensure that our team is ready to start upon award and that we could support for an accelerated award schedule if they are able to do so.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen.
Cai von Rumohr: Terrific. Thank you very much. So, could you update us on your strategy and hypersonic? I think at one point you talked about focusing predominantly on propulsion. Are you also going for a major push in the systems integration role and then maybe update us on the outlook for a counter hypersonics? Thanks.
Kathy Warden: Yes. So, in hypersonics we do have a dual path strategy, the first being to support all of the primes in propulsion. And we've talked openly about the relationship that we have with both Lockheed and Raytheon in that regard. We also are a system integrator. And the demonstration that I mentioned in my comments earlier in the call was an example of where we were the integrator for that demonstrator. So, we do see ourselves following both paths. We want to be a good provider to the primes in propulsion and that means making investments that support multiple technology paths. But at the same time, we do have the capability ourselves to prime efforts and be an integrator for certain types of systems. I also will talk briefly about counter hypersonics and there we see really our expertise in space and the capabilities that we have in space being a key enabler to the future counter hypersonic mission sets. And we have looked at the space business that we are assembling and view ourselves as both a capable prime and payload provider in that space. So again, a similar strategy that we can be both a merchant supplier to other primes with payloads of importance in that space, but also the ability to integrate systems and provide end to end capability ourselves.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harnett with Bernstein.
Doug Harnett: Thank you. Good morning. If I go back a few years and look at autonomous systems, my understanding was that a big advantage that Northrop Grumman had was on its common operating systems that they could be applied to multiple programs say in many different classes of UAVs But today, it appears that the dominant autonomous programs is still really built off of Hale Systems, Global Hawk variants, Triton. So, is there a broader platform for growth in autonomous systems that we're yet to see. Because either they're in early stage development or they're restricted or as - or should we think of this is still likely to grow off of these large Hale Systems in the future.
Kathy Warden: So, Doug, we certainly do see growth opportunity in hale systems. I would also point to examples that were working in the medium altitude space programs like Fire Scout. And then we have also areas of new technology developments that will allow us these scales the system down even further. But I would suggest to that the high altitude that you hear a speak about in the context of surveillance is the best coverage that can be provided. And so, it's quite economical for these high-altitude systems, at least in the surveillance mission to fly in high range. So, it all depends on the mission requirements. And that's what drives the system design. But we do have system architectures that allow us to scale as the mission requires.
Operator: Your next question comes from a line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America.
Ron Epstein: Good morning. Hopefully this connection is a little better.
Ken Bedingfield: That is better, Ron.
Ron Epstein: Yeah. Great. Cool. Thanks. So, Kathy, just a big picture question for you. You've been in the rollout for a little over a year. And when you think about where the Northrop Grumman is now? Is it where you wanted to be? And, if it's not what are some of the challenges you see for you over the next couple of years?
Kathy Warden: Well, thanks for the question, Ron, I appreciate the opportunity to talk about both my macro assessment and outlook. I am pleased with where we are. One of my priorities when I stepped into the role was to Orion and the team toward several high growth campaigns and align our investments there. We of course, more recently have aligned the organization to execute that strategy. And as I look to the evidence of success, I point to the backlog growth that we saw in 2019. I would also say that being a head on our revenue synergy projections came from a lot of hard work from the team on a successful Orbital ATK integration, but also very rapidly integrating them into our strategy for these mission campaigns and the growth that we see there. I also focus the team on performance and agility. And there we continue to perform well in our program even as we take on a number of new development efforts and scale production, which are difficult challenges that they come with the opportunity of long term, sustained growth as well as strong operating margins. And I'm pleased with what the team is doing there because laying the foundation not only for our near-term future, but our long-term future. We realize the cost synergy from a successful Orbital ATK integration. And again, while that's generating some short-term margin enhancement, really the opportunity there is that we're more competitive over the long term with better rates. And just overall, I feel that we've over the last year enhanced our competitiveness. The demonstrations that I talked about were very rapidly put together as a result of making smart technology investments, understanding the missions that would be needed by our customers under the national defence strategy, and rapidly aligning our portfolio to bring forward together analogies that meet those needs. So overall, I feel good about where we are. And I think we're deploying our capital in a way that not only invest in the business but return a lot of the cash we're generating to shareholders and positions us well for future optionality.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with UBS.
Myles Walton: Thanks. Good morning, I had two questions that relate to margins. The first one is on R&D; it looks like it was a couple hundred million dollars or 25%. Just curious what that looks like for 2020 in which business absorb that. And then on EACs, it looks particularly low, but the margins actually were pretty in line, despite that low EAC contribution. So, I'm curious, did you change the booking rates underlying on a systematic basis similar to kind of what you did in 2015 to reduce some of the volatility. Thanks.
Ken Bedingfield: Myles, let me take those questions at least, to start. From an R&D perspective, the biggest impact, the additional R&D was the full year of NGIS. You remember we closed that acquisition in June of 2018. So, we only had a little more than six months of their R&D, and certainly is a strong investor in technology and R&D to drive that future growth. So that's the biggest impact. I would say that this is a company that's always invested in R&D. And certainly as we look at our growth here, and our ability to grow over the long-term, I think the fact that we continue to invest in R&D through the downturn is one of the strengths that drives us today, and we will continue to do that. So, not going to put a number on it for 2020. But continued strong investment in a technology that will drive the growth that Kathy's been talking about is certainly where we're thinking about it. From your question on the EAC perspectives, I would just say that, look, a lot of the EAC adjustments are about timing. And as we think about 2019, and strong margin performance, some of that did come out of some of the more mature programs, where we have a bit of a stronger baseline margin rate rather than seeing it come through adjusted or EAC adjustments. And that's really how we think about the business, is what the programs can deliver and how the programs can perform rather than an EAC adjustment. So, as we look at 2020, and the programs and the sectors we see continued strong performance and that's how we generate that segment margin rate that we talked about in our guidance.
Kathy Warden: And Myles, as we look at net EAC adjustments in recent years, we had a high watermark in 2018, with over $0.5 billion of net favorable adjustments this year at 480, still very strong. And so, I look at our program performance and just one indicator of that is our net EAC adjustments and feel that we've been doing quite well over the last couple of years.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.
Hunter Keay: Thank you. Good morning, everybody.
Ken Bedingfield: Good morning.
Hunter Keay: Good morning. Kathy, could you talk about E-2 for a minute. Just give us an update on where you are in terms of total program size and margins. And then can you talk about growth in the program as you portion it out between domestic and international opportunities through both new potential customers and upgrades. Thank you.
Kathy Warden: Absolutely. So, as we look at the program, both domestically and internationally, we see growth. We are delivering more E-2Ds to the Navy, we also have the Japan orders that we booked in 2019, which will be deliveries over the next several years. I'll ask Ken to give you some more of the specifics on the financials, both revenue and margin rate expectations.
Ken Bedingfield: Hunter, I would just say that as we look at our awards and backlog in 2019, E-2D, contributed over $5 billion of awards as we look at both the Navy as well as Japan orders. And it's a solid contributor to revenue as well, around $1.5 billion in sales and strong margins. So really a solid program for us and one that we see as contributing nicely to our growth at Aeronautics in 2020 as well.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.
Noah Poponak: Hey, good morning, everyone.
Kathy Warden: Good morning.
Noah Poponak: So, a lot of things below the top line matter, profits and returns on capital matter, obviously. But when we speak to investors, there's still just a lot of focus on the top line, because of there seems to be a differentiation in the programs you've won, and what you've put in the backlog. And so, we kind of here two camps, one is, yes, they have the programs, but it's very diversified and there's always moving pieces. So, they're just going to grow top line 5% forever. And the second campus, no, you have to be patient and all of the large new wins start to ramp 2021 and beyond, and the growth rates going to accelerate significantly. And so, can you speak to which of those it is, and does 5% for 2020, does that meet the criteria of outpacing your end market or does that definition that you’ve provided in the past means something much faster.
Kathy Warden: So, let me take a crack at, there are in two ways. First, as we think about outpacing the end market, the investment accounts in the 2020 budgets are up 3%, and we're projecting a 5% growth. So, if you looked in the near-term, you could suggest that that is outgrowing. But as you and I both know; it takes a while for backlog in these long cycle businesses to manifest in sales. And so that goes to the premise that it does take a while to these awards that we've booked in 2019 will come into sales over a multiyear period and therefore, is derisking growth in those out years and creating the opportunity for acceleration of growth. To answer your question a little more explicitly in our portfolio, we have opportunities like GBSD, which will if awarded to us, creates a sizable ramp over the next several years. So, it's had the opportunity to create an outsized growth for our portfolio. We also have talked about space and we see space as one of the fastest growing elements of the budget. But those awards are not yet manifesting themselves in sales. And we have other rewards that we anticipate this year, depending on how successful we are, that also creates opportunity for outpaced growth. So, I think the scenario that you paint is one where there absolutely is opportunity for us to continue over the long-term to outgrow the budget growth. But that requires us to continue to win business executed successfully, just like any other organization, and you'll make the assumptions as to the confidence that you have that we'll do not operate.
Todd Ernst: Operator, we have time for one more question.
Operator: Our final question will come from the line of Carter Copeland with Melius.
Carter Copeland: Just made it in. Thanks, everybody.
Kathy Warden: Thanks Carter.
Carter Copeland: Hi, Kathy. Question on the bookings. I'm not sure, I heard it correctly, but it sounded like you said $7 billion of the $11 billion were restricted space. And if that's in a legacy restricted space organization, that would be a very large book-to-bill. So, I wondered if that was broad based or if there was anything chunky in there that we should consider as transformational in terms of how you think about the growth rate. I just - any color you can provide there would be appreciated.
Kathy Warden: Yes, I did say that of the $11 billion unrestricted award $7 billion was insane. And that spanned the three sectors in the 2019 structure that operated in space. So Aerospace Systems, Mission Systems and Innovation Systems all contributed to that $7 billion of awards that I mentioned. As we look forward in the new operating structure. All of those businesses will be together in Space System.
Todd Ernst: I like to turn the call over to Kathy for closing remarks.
Kathy Warden: Very good. Well, thank you everyone for joining us on today's call. I want to conclude by just reiterating my thanks to the team for an outstanding 2019. We're positioned well as we start the year-end 2020. With the backlog growth that we've experienced, the strong performance and our commitment to continued thoughtful capital deployment that allows us to grow this business for the long-term for our shareholders. So, thank you all for being with us today. We look forward to talking to you after our first quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-10-24 12:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Northrop Grumman's Third Quarter 2019 Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. My name is Erica, and I will be your operator today. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Todd Ernst, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Ernst, please proceed.
Todd Ernst: Thank you, Erica. Welcome to Northrop Grumman's third quarter 2019 conference call. Before we start, matters discussed on today's call including 2019 guidance and any outlook or expectations for 2020 reflect the Company's judgment based on information available at the time of this call. They constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities Laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which are noted in today's earnings release and our SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties may also cause actual Company results to differ materially. Matters discussed on today's call include non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled in our earnings release. Additional information can be found in the supplemental presentation posted on our Investor Relations website. On the call today are Kathy Warden, our Chairman, CEO and President, and Ken Bedingfield, our CFO. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kathy. Kathy?
Kathy Warden: Thank you, Todd. We're pleased to have you aboard as our Vice President of Investor Relations and I also want to thank Steve Movius for his many years of service in that role. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to our third quarter 2019 earnings call. I want to thank the entire Northrop Grumman team for another solid quarter. We delivered strong business capture and backlog growth, higher sales at all four sectors, strong earnings and healthy cash flow. Year-to-date results supported a substantial increase in our EPS guidance, as well as an increase to the lower end of our free cash flow guidance, and we are on track to achieve the other major elements of guidance. Before discussing the quarter in more detail, I want to touch on the realignment we announced in September. Beginning in January, we will have four operating sectors that more closely align with our customers' priority investment areas. Our new sectors are Aeronautics Systems, Defense Systems, Mission Systems and Space Systems. These changes will enable our teams to quickly identify and deliver solutions for rapidly evolving national security challenges. The realignment is also aimed at driving continued strong execution, sustained profitable growth and operational efficiency. Under the new structure, Aerospace Systems becomes Aeronautics Systems and continues under the leadership of Janis Pamiljans. In addition to long-duration franchise manned and unmanned program, the sector will also include the aerostructures work currently being performed at Innovation Systems. A new sector, Defense Systems brings together Technology Services, the defense businesses of Innovation Systems and select capabilities for Mission Systems. In addition to being our global sustainment and modernization business, Defense Systems includes tactical missiles, munitions and our Integrated Air and Missile Defense program. Defense Systems will focus on products and services that address evolving threats and quick-turn requirements for a wide variety of national security, military, civil and international customers. Chris Jones, the President of Technology Services has announced his intention to retire. I want to thank Chris for his many contributions to Northrop Grumman particularly for leading the effort to position Technology Services for the future. We wish him the best. Mary Petryszyn, who currently heads Land and Avionics C4ISR within Mission Systems will lead the new sector. Mission Systems remains largely intact, but with a sharpened focus on growing its leadership position in open, cyber-secure, software-defined systems for defense and intelligence application. Mark Caylor will continue to lead Mission Systems. The fourth and final sector, Space Systems brings together our significant space and launch capabilities from across the company into one organization. Space Systems will be a robust platform to accelerate the development of innovative and affordable offerings for our national security, military, civil, commercial and international customer. We expect Space Systems will be the fastest growing sector in our new structure. Blake Larson, currently the President of Innovation Systems will lead Space Systems. This realignment is the next logical step to maximize the powerful revenue synergy opportunity we envision from our combination with Orbital ATK. It also further enabled strong execution and our organization's agility. Turning to financial highlights for the quarter. Sales rose 5% to approximately $8.5 billion and included sales growth at all four sectors. Our year-to-date segment operating margin rate of 11.5% is tracking to our guidance of approximately 11.5% for the year reflecting solid operational results. Cash from operations increased $327 million to $1.1 billion in the third quarter and free cash flow increased to $882 million. Year-to-date, operations have generated $1.8 billion of cash. After capital expenditures of approximately $800 million, year-to-date free cash flow increased to approximately $1 billion. New awards remained robust and demonstrate our strong competitive position in critical national security domain. In the third quarter, we booked more than $10 billion in new award or 1.2 times sale. Book-to-bill was above 1 times at Innovation Systems, Mission Systems, and Technology Services. At Aerospace Systems, year-to-date, book-to-bill is 1.6 times sale and backlog is up 28%. During the third quarter, Japan exercised an option for nine additional E-2D Advanced Hawkeyes for approximately $1.4 billion. This is in addition to the $3.3 billion multi-year award we booked last quarter. I would also note that France has indicated they're interested in purchasing three E-2Ds. At Innovation Systems, we booked the initial $300 million of $1.1 billion Missile Defense Agency competitive award to supply new targets and countermeasures used to test the Ballistic Missile Defense System. Our offering provides a new solution to the complex threat scenarios our customers face. I also note that IS has been awarded approximately $1.3 billion for hypersonic and counter-hypersonic activities, as both the prime and subcontractor. At Mission Systems, we were awarded a 13-year IDIQ to -- contract to produce and sustain next-generation navigation systems for the US Air Force and international customers. The Sole Source Award has a potential value of $1.4 billion. Mission Systems also booked a six-year $375 million order to provide surveillance radars for the Navy's Triton Aircraft, and a $200 million IDIQ Award for our layer front [Phonetic] systems and related support. And at Technology Services, in addition to winning two large recompete, TS won a competitive restricted award valued in the hundreds of millions of dollars. We're particularly pleased with this award as it demonstrates the sector's ability to win new restricted work and expand our national security services portfolio. A good indicator of our company's portfolio alignment to the national defense strategy is our growing share of restricted work. Year-to-date, restricted awards totaled $8.5 billion. At the Company level, restricted work across multiple domains continues to grow as a percent of total revenue. As of September 30th, total restricted backlog has grown 22% since year-end, and new awards of approximately $36 billion or 1.4 times year-to-date sales. Looking ahead, we have large opportunities across our portfolio in four sectors -- in all four sectors and program execution remains solid. Turning to Aerospace Systems. F-35 production continues to ramp up. Year-to-date, AS has delivered 100 center fuselage units and we are on pace to deliver a total of 134 units in 2019, 13 more than last year. As we celebrate the 30th anniversary of our B-2 Spirit, the world's first stealth bomber, we continue to perform well on the B-21 radar, our nation's next-generation stealth bomber. Last month the then acting Secretary of the Air Force, Matt Donovan noted that the development program is on schedule and production will occur in Palmdale, California. At Mission Systems, our IBCS Systems successfully intercepted a cruise missile at an extended range with Sentinel and Patriot System. The flight test demonstrated the value of IBCS to detect, track and engage low-flying threats at a distance well beyond the range limitation of the current Patriot System. In August, Innovation Systems submitted our proposal for the National Security Space Launch, down-select, which is currently planned for the third quarter of 2020. Our OmegA vehicle is on track to meet the customers' requirement for a first launch in 2021 and operational launches of national security payloads in 2022. On GBSD, we have assembled an exceptional nationwide industry team, that is ready to meet the Air Force's technical and schedule requirements. We are successfully executing on the TMMR phase of the program and we look forward to submitting our proposal for the next phase of the competition. The Air Force has been clear that our nation urgently needs to modernize the ICBM System, and that it is critical that this acquisition remains on schedule. Turning to the US defense budget. We're now working under a continuing resolution that expires on November 21st. More often than not, we begin each fiscal year under a CR and we don't expect this to cause a significant disruption to our fourth quarter activities or our outlook for next year as long as there is not a prolonged CR. Our customers need predictable funding that is not constrained by continuing resolution limits. This enables investment in the critical technologies we need to stay ahead of rapidly advancing global threat. We believe our nation's leaders will provide the necessary resources to modernize key capabilities and therefore we are hopeful that the government will act quickly to finalize appropriations. In closing, based on a solid quarter, strong year-to-date performance and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we are again increasing 2019 earnings per share guidance. We now expect mark-to-market EPS will range between $20.10 and $20.35. We are maintaining our sales guidance of approximately $34 billion, and we are updating our free cash flow guidance by raising the bottom end of the range by $100 million. We now expect free cash flow of $2.7 billion to $3 billion for the year. Regarding the 2020 outlook, we will provide detailed guidance in January. We expect mid-single-digit sales growth in 2020, which now includes the impact of the Lake City contract winding down in the latter part of the year. We also expect segment margin rates consistent with 2019 and strong and growing free cash flow. So now, I'll turn the call over to Ken for a more detailed discussion of our financial results and guidance. Ken?
Ken Bedingfield: Thanks, Kathy, and good afternoon, everyone. I also want to thank the team for another solid quarter. We had excellent awards, strong book-to-bill, and higher sales at all four sectors. Year-to-date awards support our outlook for continued top-line growth. And as Kathy said, we are tracking to our segment margin rate guidance. Turning to the sectors. Aerospace Systems sales rose 5%. Higher manned aircraft reflects volume increases on the E-2D and F-35 programs. Space sales also increased reflecting growing activity on next-gen OPIR programs. Autonomous Systems sales were also higher due to volume increases in multiple areas, including Global Hawk. AS third quarter operating income declined to $324 million and operating margin rate was 9.4%. This was driven by lower net favorable EAC adjustments. AS had fewer favorable adjustments this quarter primarily due to timing. We also had negative performance adjustments on two activities. The B-2 Defensive Management System Modernization program is experiencing schedule delays. Although the upgrade has taken longer than planned, installation of DMS has been completed on the first test aircraft and aircraft checkout is underway. AS has now completed most milestones on the program and are well along toward completion. We also experienced production delays for certain commercial space components. We have introduced new leadership and processes in this business in order to successfully complete these contracts. In both cases, we believe our current EACs have captured the cost to complete the required work. Excluding these two adjustments, AS third quarter margin rate would have been in the mid 10% range. We continue to expect AS sales for the year in the high $13 billion range. We are maintaining operating margin rate guidance of mid-to-high 10% with a bias toward the lower end of the range. At Innovation Systems, third quarter sales rose 12% in its first full quarter comparison. In Space, we had higher volume on national security satellite systems. Defense Systems had higher volume on precision munitions, armaments and tactical missiles, including the AARGM-ER program. Flight Systems had increased volume on military and commercial aerospace structures. IS operating income increased 2%, reflecting higher sales. Operating margin rate for the quarter was solid at 10.4%. The prior year period benefited from favorable indirect performance and the recovery of an insurance claim. Year-to-date, operating margin rate is 11.1%. For the year, we continue to expect IS sales of approximately $6 billion with a high 10% operating margin rate. No change to prior guidance. Turning to Mission Systems. Third quarter sales grew 4% and operating income was comparable to last year. Advanced capabilities had higher volume on marine programs. Cyber and ISR had higher volume on space and restricted programs. Sensors and Processing had increased activity on airborne radar and electronic warfare programs, including F-35 and radars [Phonetic]. Based on year-to-date results, we continue to expect MS revenue to grow to the low-to-mid $12 billion range. And we are raising margin rate guidance to the low 13% range. At Technology Services, sales rose 3% and operating income rose 23% with an operating margin rate of 12.7%. As we discussed last quarter, program headwinds are moderating and we are now seeing the underlying sales growth in both TS businesses. Operating income benefited from a focus on cost reduction, as well as a favorable adjustment on a sustainment program. We continue to expect TS sales in the low $4 billion range, no change to prior guidance. And based on strong year-to-date performance, we are raising guidance for TS operating margin rate. We now expect a high 10% range versus prior guidance of low 10%. As we roll all that up, we continue to expect 2019 sales of approximately $34 billion with a total segment operating margin rate of approximately 11.5%. Below segment OM, we continue to expect unallocated corporate expense of $225 million. Unallocated corporate expense is typically higher in the fourth quarter and our guidance contemplates an estimate for state deferred taxes and year-end accruals. We are increasing our guidance for total operating margin rate to approximately 11%, largely due to updated cash pension estimates as we completed our annual demographic study. The presentation materials we posted this morning include updated estimates for CAS, net FAS/CAS pension adjustment and required funding for 2019 through 2021. Our 2019 estimates do not include the mark-to-market adjustment we will be recording in the fourth quarter. 2020 and 2021 estimates are based on year-to-date trends and assume a discount rate of 3.31%, 12% planned asset return in 2019 and 8% planned asset returns thereafter. Through September 30, our actual returns were about 14%. I'd also note that our CAS prepayment credit approximates $2 billion. The demographic study increased 2019 CAS and net FAS/CAS adjustment by $60 million. For 2020 and 2021, our updated assumptions increased net FAS/CAS adjustments by $140 million and $80 million respectively. And over the three-year period, our required funding is about $100 million lower. Moving to taxes. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 11.6%. Based on year-to-date results and our updated fourth quarter analysis, we now expect the tax rate in the low 16% range for the year. Wrapping all that up and considering year-to-date results, we are increasing our mark-to-market adjusted earnings per share guidance to a range of $20.10 to $20.35. This continues to be based on approximately $170 million weighted average shares outstanding. Free cash flow increased $352 million in the quarter. Year-to-date, we've generated more than $1 billion in free cash flow. Based on year-to-date results and our fourth quarter outlook, we are raising the bottom end of the free cash flow range by $100 million. We now expect $2.7 billion to $3 billion for the year. We continue to expect capital expenditures of approximately $1.2 billion, as well as share repurchases of approximately $750 million. And as planned, we retired $500 million of debt in the third quarter. Beyond this year, we expect growing cash flows driven by higher sales and earnings, some improvements in working capital and modest required pension funding. Regarding capital expenditures, we continue to invest in growth opportunities as robust backlog growth continues. We are still targeting capex at about 2.5% of sales in 2021. In summary, we had a solid third quarter and we expect strong results for the remainder of the year. I think we're ready for Q&A. Todd?
Todd Ernst: Erica, we're ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Peter Arment with Baird.
Peter Arment: Afternoon, Kathy, Ken, Todd welcome.
Ken Bedingfield: Yes, thanks.
Peter Arment: Kathy, thanks for the -- all the details on the realignment. Could you maybe give us just your thoughts on, sometimes when you do a realignment, you do shine a bright light on something that doesn't fit. Is this going to result in any portfolio shaping and just any updated thoughts on that? Thanks.
Kathy Warden: Yes, thanks for the question. And you're absolutely right, as we did this realignment, we've looked in depth of what we had in the portfolio to ensure that we were getting things aligned in a way that would create the most value for the company going forward. And I'm really pleased with the structure we're putting in place, it seizes the opportunity that we knew we had in space to bring the portfolio together in the new Space sector. I'm also excited about the creation of the Defense Systems sector, as it brings together some of our munitions and integrated air and missile defense capabilities in a tighter way along with our sustainment strategies, which deal with customers' very quick-turn requirement. So, this has really been about the forward look in our company and seizing those opportunities that exist. And as we did shine a light on the whole of the portfolio, there wasn't anything that didn't fit within the structure that we created. But, of course, I continue to look at that on a regular basis and as we execute the strategies that we defined in this newer realignment, we'll continue to assess just that question.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, good afternoon, everyone. This is Kristine [ph] dialing in for Ron today. And -- yes. I just wanted to follow up on the B-2 Defensive Management System Modernization effort. Are the operating issues you're facing there related to the re-baselining of the program, and then also, should we expect lower margins in this program to continue to your B-2 contracts going forward or is this issue kind of a one-time thing?
Kathy Warden: So, Kristine, I'll start and then hand it over to Ken to talk about the financial implications of what we saw on B-2 this quarter. We are managing thousands of contracts across the company and delivering very strong performance. And sometimes contracts are re-baselined as we did report earlier in the year, the B-2 program. What we saw this quarter was an adjustment there that Ken outlined in his comments related to the performance on that program. We feel very good about where we are in completing major milestones on our way to finalizing and executing the B-2 program. It is complex to update a system of that type, but we now have our arms around those challenges. So, I'll turn it over to Ken to talk a little bit more about the financial implications.
Ken Bedingfield: Thanks, Kathy and Kristine, I appreciate the question. Let me just say that, as I mentioned in my comments, we do believe that our EAC reflects the cost that we think will be required to complete the program. And as we look at our portfolio and I'll just go back to Kathy's comments, a portfolio of many different programs and contracts across not just the Aerospace sector, but across the company. We don't expect this program as it will book essentially a lower margin from now until completion to have any material impact on our overall segment margin rate at either AS or in total for the company, again, given the very diverse portfolio that we manage on a day-to-day basis.
Operator: Your next question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.
Seth Seifman: Hey, good morning. Thanks. Ken, maybe if you could talk about -- you mentioned repaying some of the debt. When you look out beyond this year, there's some debt coming due each of the next couple of years. Can you talk about the approach that you plan to take there?
Ken Bedingfield: Sure, Seth. I would say as we look forward, we do have debt coming due. We also have a growing EBITDA as we look at growing the business, growing the top-line and maintaining strong margins, and that growing EBITDA gives us some naturally deleveraging there. So, as we look at that, I would say, we've got some optionality on what to do and depending on the value-creating opportunities that we see in front of us will very much shape what we do in terms of that debt repayment strategy, and we'll continue to evaluate what are the most value-creating uses of our capital and that will really shape it.
Operator: Your next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Thank you. Good afternoon, Kathy and Ken. Kathy, you made some preliminary comments on 2020. Can you talk about your comments regarding margin mix and having it consistent or margins being consistent, can you talk about mix within the portfolio, how you see it transitioning from mature to development programs, if you could give some color?
Kathy Warden: So, we'll be giving detailed guidance in January in our new structural alignment, but my comments did apply to the company as a whole seeing our segment operating margin rate stay consistent with 2019 guidance. And as we look at what's happening within our segment operating margin rate, we are taking on additional development work and there is some downward pressure on margin rates as a result, but we're also having very good cost management, which is offsetting our rates and allowing us to keep both competitive rates to win new business, but also healthy segment operating margin rate, and we expect that trend to continue into 2020. So, it's like a duck on water. While we're remaining consistent, there is a lot happening beneath to keep the margin rates consistent even as we take on additional development work.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from David Strauss with Barclays.
David Strauss: Thanks, good afternoon, everyone. Wanted to -- on the mid-single-digit sales growth guidance, Ken, you had been hinting potentially something higher than that on the last call, I know you talked about Lake City. How much does Lake City's -- was Lake City kind of the only change versus what you said prior and how does that impact things in '20 and I guess in the '21 as well? Thanks.
Ken Bedingfield: Of course. Yes, as we look at our sales growth for 2020, really Lake City has the biggest impact that we see versus the previous outlook that we had provided. We look at Lake City as probably having about a 1% impact on what we had expected for 2020 sales. And certainly, as we look forward, we see -- again, after the Lake -- after Lake City coming out, mid-single sales growth, solid margins and then again that growing cash. So, we're looking forward to performing on the existing portfolio driving that growth and turning that into margin cash.
Operator: Your next question comes from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley.
Rajeev Lalwani: Hi, good afternoon. Ken, a question for you just coming back to the couple of comments you made on cash. I appreciate the color on easing capex and improving working capital. Can you maybe take it a step further and give us an idea of what conversion looks like over the next few years and maybe in 2021 and in particular given your comments there on capex levels?
Ken Bedingfield: Sure, Rajeev. Let me first comment -- from a conversion perspective, I would just say, you really need to be careful as you think about conversion for a number of reasons. I mean, first of all, the pension impact, as well as the amortization of PI and things like that. So, let me really focus on kind of how we're looking at cash and as we look forward to 2020 and beyond, we'll provide detailed guidance in January and walk you through all that. I'll just say that we've been clear that this business is going to be a strong generator of cash as we look forward. And let me just kind of walk through some of the drivers there. As I said, we continue to expect solid sales growth for several years and that's really driven by our portfolio alignment to customer needs. And I would say it's demonstrated by the strong backlog that we've been generating and quite frankly, we continue to expect to generate in Q4 and 2020. And as I mentioned, we continue to expect to generate strong margins and convert those margins into cash.
Rajeev Lalwani: Yes, that's what he asked just about kind of taking an [Phonetic] answer, do you want to say it or just kind of ...
Kathy Warden: Well.
Ken Bedingfield: Erica, can you mute the other line, please? given our confidence -- given our confidence on our expected 2019 cash performance, we did increase the bottom end of the range, as Kathy mentioned to $2.7 billion, and we continue to be confident on our 2020 free cash flow growth. So, as we've been investing in the business to drive growth and a lot of that investment at AS, where we've grown the business 30% in three years, and at IS, that will grow double-digits in 2019, we continue to expect about $1.2 billion of capex this year or about 3.5% of sales. And looking at 2020, we expect capex to be in the range of 3% to 3.5% of sales as we trend down to the 2.5% range in 2021. And I'd just say these investments continue to support our growing backlog and a robust set of near-term opportunities across multiple domains, including restricted space. So, just moving on from capex, again, pensions are well funded, some of the best funded plans in the industry, and that offers us structural advantage in our new business captures. Working capital as I mentioned, should moderate a bit starting in 2020, a bit more opportunity probably in the out-years, some of that being timing of cash receipt milestones and some of that continued focus on solid working capital management.
Operator: Your next question is from Doug Harnett with Bernstein.
Doug Harnett: Thank you, good afternoon. I want -- I wanted to understand a little bit better the growth trajectory in -- on the AS side, and if you look at the elements of this, I mean, you have F-35, clearly, there is some restricted space growth, but on autonomous systems in the release you refer to Global Hawk, but when we look at autonomous systems, it looks heavily biased toward Hail Systems, and those appear -- appear to be somewhat episodic in nature, I mean, on Global Hawk, NATO AGS, Triton. Can you talk about how we should think about this as more of a long-term trajectory with autonomous platforms?
Kathy Warden: Yes, Doug. So, as I think about the opportunity for unmanned systems, we've clearly seen some adoption for unmanned in applications like intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance. As we look into the future, we believe unmanned systems will be utilized for more missions and we also see the opportunity for more international sales of unmanned systems as export regulations are considered and perhaps addressed to allow more of its capability to get into the hands of our allied nation. So, when we think about UAS under over a long-term trajectory, we see a continued evolution of these platforms into additional mission, we see them continuing to evolve in terms of their technical capabilities and these are the areas that we are investing in as a company. Today, there's everything from remotely piloted to truly autonomous systems, as you know, we tend to operate on the high end of that sector and we believe more missions will continue to evolve to that higher end capability as well.
Operator: Your next question comes from Myles Walton with UBS.
Myles Walton: Thanks, good afternoon. Kathy, I know that in the -- Kathy in the 10-Q, you alluded to the FTC disclosure specifically as the rates of the competition for GBSD. I'm just curious in your conversations with the customer, how they may or may not view this as an impediment to kind of bids being received, which I guess have a December -- mid-December is I guess the timeline for that?
Kathy Warden: Yes, thanks, Myles. So, we did indeed receive an inquiry from the FTC, and I want to note that we've been working with the FTC and the Department of Defense to ensure our compliance with the FTC decision in order that were -- that governs our ability to enter into the transaction of acquiring Orbital ATK and we're going to continue to do so. This is just a more formal inquiry that we are responding to as part of this latest request and that's why we disclosed it in the Q. With regard to the GBSD competition, we haven't seen any changes regarding the RFP process since the [Phonetic] final RFP was released this summer. As you know, we have established a nationwide team and it's ready to go in meeting the Air Force's technical and schedule requirements for the competition. So, we're looking forward to supporting and submitting our proposal in December, and we've had no indications that there will be any change to the acquisition strategy at this point, and both the Department and the Air Force has made statements as recently as this week about their support for the program.
Operator: Your next question comes from Carter Copeland with Melius Research.
Carter Copeland: Good afternoon, team. Kathy, I just wanted to ask about more broadly program performance. I mean, this is I think the only -- only the second quarter I can recall on a decade, where there were more than one negative performance call-out, and I just -- I think the last one was a little more than a year ago. So, I just wanted to make sure there is not some sort of trend here that especially, with the realignment, you guys will have some stuff moving around, and I wonder as we go through that, if you can just talk about your confidence level that you have that other stuff may not emerge as you go through that process because it's got a lot of complexity and you guys are managing a lot right now. So just broadly, if you could speak to program performance, I'd appreciate it?
Kathy Warden: Yes, thanks, Carter. As I look at our program performance, it continues to be very strong. I'm particularly proud with some of the large development efforts that we've undertaken, as well as our ramp on major production programs that we are delivering on those very well, you've seen some public statements by our customers about how pleased they are with our performance on some of those, so I won't rehash them here. But every year, we do have a small number of programs that require negative EAC adjustments based on performance out of the thousands of contracts that we're managing and sometimes the timing of those adjustments causes a particular segment's operating margin rate to fall below our expectations in that quarter. You're referring to that this quarter with AS and a little over a year ago with Mission Systems. But as you've seen over time, our performance management has remained strong and we're yielding good margins as a result of these circumstances being few and far between and fairly isolated. So, that was the case that you saw in AS this quarter. I'll also note, we had positive EAC adjustments that delivered to both expected segment operating margins and that happened in TS this quarter and is driving the increase in segment operating margin guidance at both MS and TS for the year. So, performance overall is still very strong in our company, and as a result, we're continuing to hold our guidance for the year on operating margin performance. Carter, if I could just add, I would say that in terms of the items that we called out this quarter, we were really trying to indicate what was the trend between last year's third quarter and this year's third quarter and help you understand the movement there as opposed to trying to identify the two items as having a longer impact on our performance. So, really it was a comment with respect to just the trend between Q3 '18 and Q3 '19.
Operator: Your next question comes from Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse.
Robert Spingarn: Hi, good afternoon. I wanted to turn to -- hey, guys, I wanted to turn to TS, especially since we really won't be able to see it in the future, but it seems like under the hood, it's accelerating here with high single-digit growth to the US government, double-digit growth internationally. And since the headwinds are dissipating here in Q4, could this business despite the -- in its old form, for example, see mid-to-high single-digit sales growth next year if we thought about it in its present form because I think that's going to be a little bit obscured, so I'm curious?
Kathy Warden: So Rob, certainly, this year we have worked to reposition TS to be more competitive, that's been some good cost management, it's then rebuilding a stronger pipeline, and I'm really proud of what the team has done there and you see in the third quarter, a return to growth year-over-year and a strong operating margin. I believe that can persist and as we said, we do expect this to be a growing segment of our business in 2020. I would not go with far to say high single-digits, I would see it more in the low-to mid-single-digits, it is on a bit of a ramp and we still have some VITA burning off through the remainder of this year. So, that would be my macro outlook, and I'll hand it to Ken for any other comments he wants to make.
Ken Bedingfield: Yes, let me -- I guess, what I would say is, just to kind of frame up TS for the quarter and just to make sure we're all on the same page. We did see 3% growth at TS quarter-over-quarter, and I think you might be referring to in the schedules in the footnotes, there were some higher sales to the US government as opposed to some inter-segment sales and we've been working at TS to make -- essentially for TS to be the prime on certain international programs and particularly, International Hail and some others, where they were previously a sub to AS. So what you, I think are seeing somewhat there is, they are priming some of those programs that are some FMS, some through the US government as well, there were some B-2 work, where they were previously through AS, where now they are the prime. But as we look at it at a top level 3% growth this quarter. We look forward to the continued growth of the TS sector in 2020 as it's a part of the Defense Systems. But broadly, we would -- wouldn't necessarily see it in that, that high single-digit range that you -- high single-digit range that you were referring to. I think some of that is just movement in the different parts between -- in our segment and the prime work.
Operator: Your next question comes from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.
Noah Poponak: Hi, good afternoon, everyone. Ken, just going back to the segment margins for 2020, I think you've talked about the possibility of expanding margins modestly over time here, because you've mixed down a bunch over the past few years and maybe have hit a floor in that mixing down. And in 2020 you'll be -- at AS you'll be now comping against this -- the issue in this quarter hopefully not repeating it, Lake City out, I think helps the margin compare. Mission Systems is your largest earnings contributor and highest margin segment and I think may grow the fastest next year, actually, would love to hear your thoughts on that since that one's maybe not accelerating as quickly as we thought. But, so -- it seems like there are some margin uppers next year. Am I not appreciating how much development or classified work is still coming in or should we be thinking about flat as a floor with some upside potential?
Ken Bedingfield: So as we look at 2020 margins, I would say, first of all, as we think about 2019, we are essentially for the full-year still projecting where we expect it to be for 2019 from a segment margin basis, and each of the sectors is consistent to where it's been with the exception of TS, where we're looking at that increasing. You had some questions about AS and I would say, again, their forecast for '19 is consistent with where it is today. And -- so I don't necessarily think of that differently from a Lake City perspective, certainly, we don't see that as having a significant impact overall on the portfolio. And just kind of thinking through it, we're -- we'll provide guidance in January when we get to that point. We certainly will work in 2020 to continue to perform on our portfolio and see the ability to drive up those margin rates as we work through the year and we've tried to do in the past, but we do continue to have some early-phase development work in particular, IS has some early-phase development work in the restricted space area or in the national security space as we call it. And that will be one of the drivers to what you will see, I think to your question about the fastest grower what I think you will ultimately see as the Space sector as the fastest grower in 2020. But again, we'll provide more detail and guidance when we get to the January call.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jon Raviv with Citi.
Jon Raviv: Thank you. Just following up on margin question in 2020, but a big -- bit bigger picture. Ken, you -- Ken, you started talking about the IS classified being some of the pressure there, can you just identify some other areas of the business that are seeing more of that development pressure? And then on a related note, is there something different about the development that you're doing today versus what you're doing maybe a few years ago that might be putting a little more pressure on early-on rates perhaps anything to do with contract structures requiring more risk upfront or anything like that? Thank you.
Ken Bedingfield: So, as we look at it, I don't see anything different honestly, Jon, with respect to what we're doing today. I mean, simply when we start in the early phase of a long development program, we're identifying the risks and therefore we're tending to book a lower rate as we try to burn down those risks over time. So, no change in how that's worked over the years. I think the biggest change being that we're seeing more opportunities for early development growth. And those are opportunities that we're more than willing to take on, and those will lead to those next-generation production programs that will provide that additional opportunity for margin expansion down the road. So, I don't see any change. I mean, as I think about some of the restricted programs, they may not be multi-year awards, but many of them are multi-year in periods of performance. And so we're just managing risk over that long-term period of performance and again trying to create those opportunities as we look forward.
Operator: Your next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.
Cai von Rumohr: Thank you very much. Maybe going back to Myles's question, the FTC investigation. Do you expect it to have any impact on when the GBSD decision might be made and roughly when might that be? And have you had any pressure or kind of suggestion from the customer that maybe you might consider the national team proposal that Boeing has made?
Kathy Warden: So, Cai, we do not currently expect any change to the Air Force acquisition strategy as a result of this inquiry. They do you plan to award next August, so there is some time. Our proposal is due in December, and so obviously we will continue to monitor that, but right now, we do not see any impact. And in terms of the question about any pressure, we are not receiving any pressure to engage in a national team, because I would point out that we do have a, what we're calling nationwide team that includes many large and small companies across the country, who are bringing strong capability that will support our GBSD bid.
Operator: Your next question comes from Richard [ph] with Buckingham.
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks. Kathy, Ken, Todd, good afternoon. How are you?
Ken Bedingfield: Good. How are you, Rich?
Kathy Warden: Well, thanks.
Unidentified Analyst: So, an F-35 question with just a few parts to it as usual partly based on your opening remarks. So, the House and Senate fiscal 2021 mark-up has an increase in the F-35 quantities by 12 or 18 aircraft depending on which version you believe impacting I think Lot 14. So to the best you Ken as always, could you tell us what's being assumed in your 2020 guide for F-35 quantities? Now Kathy, you mentioned no disruption to your guide from the CR, but I wanted to know and maybe it's pressing you a little bit here. Is it possible that you could alter your guide depending on what happens in November when the CR expires and we potentially have a budget with possibly higher F-35 quantities, what do you think you likely captured all the -- all likely scenarios? And then finally, you've had enviable margins on the program, just wanting to know if that continues with the block buy? Thanks.
Kathy Warden: Great. So, I'll start with some of your more macro questions and then turn it to Ken on the quantity specifically. As I noted in my comments, we do not see an impact on our guide for a for a short-term CR. If we were to sustain a longer-term CR, that would impact to cause us to revisit our guidance, and I would include F-35 quantity in that statement. We have contemplated the possible quantities on F-35 changing through the appropriations process and feel that that's adequately reflected in our guide for '20 -- will be in our guide for 2020, because of course at this point, we've just given 2020 outlook. The other thing that I'll note is on F-35, we continue to focus on performing and driving down the cost curve and being a good partner to Lockheed Martin, but we also have opportunities on the program that are causing some growth for us over the next several years. One, of course, is increased sustainment work on the program, which I've spoken to before. And we're also seeing growth from the Block IV modernization program. We're working new development on our sensors specifically, radar, comms, navigation and identification sensors, and this will yield production opportunity in the long-term. So, we think lots 14 and beyond, and we have some production growth to support additional bearing with quantities increasing between lots 12 and 14. So, those aren't significant drivers. They're not nearly as significant as the production quantity itself, but those are some additional opportunities that we have in both the near and the longer-term on the program. And I'll turn it to Ken to add anything he'd like.
Ken Bedingfield: I think you -- you've nailed it there, Kathy. I would say, we certainly wouldn't want to go into the quantities that we've assumed for our 2020 outlook at this point, Rich, but we are continuing to perform on the program, proud of the performance that we've seen at both really at all of the sectors, who are supporting the program, supporting our customers. And we have continued to increase quantities and we'll see some continued ramp, and then Kathy kind of talked about what that longer-term profile looks like. So, I think that's -- that really captures it.
Todd Ernst: Erica, we have time for one more question.
Operator: Your final question comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.
George Shapiro: Yes. You made a comment that Lake City would be about 1% sales impact next year, that says to me that you may still -- you may have Lake City for half of the year, because I would have thought the total impact would have been about 2% of sales? And then my second question is, how long does the current B-2 contract for which you took would look like a pretty sizable hit in the quarter last? Thanks.
Ken Bedingfield: Sure. Thanks, George. On Lake City, you are correct. We do have a transition from ourselves to the new provider of that service and so we will be performing on that program for at least the first half of the year for 2020. And so we will see some volume on that and the 1%, I was referring to was actually the reduction that we see to the previous outlook we had for sales, so, about a 1% reduction to our previous outlook relative to Lake City. From a B-2 perspective, George, I would say that I wouldn't want to comment extensively on the period of performance other than to say that, as I mentioned in my remarks, we're well along on program. We're making good progress. We're passing milestones. And I would just point out to your question about the substantial amount of the adjustment, I would just say that in regards to the adjustments at Aerospace Systems this quarter, neither one of them was in excess of $20 million. Again, we largely highlighted those as having an impact on the trend from our Q3 margin rate of 2018 to our Q3 margin rate of 2019. So, just a little color there for you.
Todd Ernst: Okay. I'd like to turn the call over to Kathy for final remarks.
Kathy Warden: Thank you, Todd. One correction from my commentary that I want to make sure I convey is the total backlog, not total restricted backlog growth year-to-date is 22%. So again, I want to thank our team for another strong quarter of financial and operating performance. We're executing well, building on our backlog for profitable growth and strategically aligned to our customers' highest priorities. And all of this provides us an exceptional platform for sustained value creation. So, we're focused on delivering a solid finish to 2019 and a strong start to 2020 with our new organization alignment. I look forward to updating you again in January and providing detailed 2020 guidance in that call. Thank you for joining our call today.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-07-24 12:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to Northrop Grumman’s Second Quarter 2019 Conference Call. Today’s call is being recorded. My name is Natalia, and I will be your operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Steve Movius, Treasurer and Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Movius, please proceed.
Steve Movius: Thanks, Natalia, and welcome to Northrop Grumman’s second quarter 2019 conference call. Before we start, please understand that matters discussed on today’s call constitute forward-looking statements, pursuant to Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which are noted in today’s earnings release and our SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties may cause actual Company results to differ materially. Matters discussed on today’s call will also include non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled in our earnings release and supplemental presentation. On the call today are Kathy Warden, our CEO and President; and Ken Bedingfield, our CFO. At this time, I’d like to turn the call over to Kathy.
Kathy Warden: Thank you, Steve. Hello, everyone, and welcome to today’s call. We had an excellent second quarter results across the board, including business capture, backlog growth, sales, earnings and cash. Based on our strong performance and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we are increasing 2019 guidance. I want to thank the Northrop Grumman team. I’m particularly proud of our ability to deliver innovative, quality products and services, which enable global security and human advancement. Starting with Space, as we celebrate the 50th anniversary of our nation’s Apollo 11 lunar landing, we are proud of our strong legacy in supporting each of our nation’s manned space flights to-date. Looking forward, we are poised to continue supporting manned space flight through NASA’s Artemis program, which is expected to return humans to the moon by 2024. In addition, this quarter, Innovation Systems has passed its one-year anniversary as our fourth sector, and I’m delighted with the progress we’re making. Costs and operational synergies are on track and our margin rates across the Company are benefiting from the synergies realized since the acquisition. We are also realizing revenue synergies sooner than we expected. A good indicator of our success in capturing revenue synergies is our growing share of restricted work. We booked $843 million in restricted space awards during the second quarter and $4.5 billion in the first quarter. At the Company level, restricted work across multiple domains continues to grow as a percent of total revenue. This demonstrates our strong alignment to the national defense strategy and our ability to leverage our entire portfolio to create innovative solutions for our customers. We booked net awards of $13.5 billion in the second quarter and $25.8 billion year-to-date. Now, net awards are approximately 1.6 times sales and our total backlog is up 18% to $63 billion. The large multi-year awards we are capturing across the Company are the building blocks for sustainable long-term profitable growth. Year-to-date, Aerospace Systems has booked net awards of approximately $13 billion and total backlog has increased 28% since year-end. In the second quarter, we booked $3.6 billion for the E-2D. Approximately $3.3 billion was booked at AS for the U.S. Navy’s next 24 Advanced Hawkeyes and associated deliverables, with the balance awarded at Mission Systems. In addition to U.S. Navy Aircraft, the multi-year includes an option for the nine additional E-2Ds for Japan. In the second quarter, we delivered the first four E-2Ds currently under contract for Japan. And we anticipate being under contract for the additional nine by the end of this year. On the F-35 program, we booked awards of over $4 billion in the quarter across our four sectors. At Aerospace Systems, we finalized to $4.9 billion agreement for production lots 12 through 14 center fuselage units, and booked an award of approximately $3 billion, net of previous incremental funding. Mission Systems added $1 billion of award for additional F-35 radar CNI and DAS production. And IS and TS together, were awarded approximately $100 million for their scope on the program. Moving to Innovation Systems, year-to-date net awards totaled approximately $3 billion. In addition to our prime role of supporting U.S. government hypersonic weapon systems development efforts, we are also supporting Lockheed Martin and Raytheon program. In the second quarter, Lockheed Martin awarded us $265 million for the Intermediate Range Conventional Prompt Strike program and IS is working with Raytheon on the Hypersonic Air-Breathing Weapon Concept or HAWC program. Shortly after the end of the quarter, Space Norway awarded IS a $250 million contract for its Arctic Satellite Broadband Mission to provide critical ground infrastructure and to design, manufacture and integrate two satellites. This activity increases utilization of our hot production line enhancing affordability and production efficiency across our customer base. In addition, Aerospace Systems is developing payloads for the Space Norway satellite, which will be hosted on the IS bus. This is another example of revenue synergy in the space domain, and it highlights our industry-leading end-to-end capability. Now moving to Mission Systems. We signed a $1 billion contract to begin full-rate production on our G/ATOR program after achieving initial operating capability in the first quarter. G/ATOR is our first ground-based gallium nitride or GaN radar to be operationally fielded. It combines five legacy systems into a single solution, improving mission performance and reducing customer costs. G/ATOR provides real-time 360 degree situational awareness against a broad array of threats and we see the system, having strong opportunity for international sales. Mission Systems is also supplying the upgraded integrated avionics suite for the Black Hawk program, which entered LRIP in April. An initial 25 kits were ordered under this LRIP and the Army plans to upgrade 760 Black Hawks with this avionic suite. And lastly, the Army awarded us an OTA for agile software development of their next incremental build with the IBCS capability. This competitive win signifies our customers’ confidence in our ability and commitment to accelerate delivery of critical new war fighting capabilities. Mission Systems, year-to-date net awards totaled approximately $8 billion and backlog is up 14% from year-end. The common thread running through our successful efforts on G/ATOR, Black Hawk as well as IBCS is our modular multi-mission, open architecture approach to next-generation defense electronics. We are reaping the benefit of substantial technology investments we’ve made to support development of solutions that give the customer advanced performance and greater affordability, as well as the ability to rapidly address future threats. Turning to Technology Services. Global Services booked $223 million for an international training program, a $70 million task order to support the Joint Chiefs of Staff and a $59 million contract to provide enterprise defense cyber operations for the Marine Corps. In Global Logistics and Modernization, we secured a $162 million Army award for sustainment of the Hunter unmanned aircraft system. And on EA PUP, our Electronic Attack Pod Upgrade Program, the Air Force exercised a $44 million option. Our business capture has been outstanding year-to-date and we expect strong bookings to continue. We have a robust opportunity set across the Corporation with large potential awards in restricted space, National Security Space Launch, GBSD and product line expansion in airborne radar and electronic warfare. In May, on the National Security Space Launch program, Innovation Systems successfully conducted a full scale of static fire test of the first stage of our new OmegA rocket. This milestone keeps OmegA on track to performance first launch in 2021 and begin operational launches of National Security payloads in 2022, meeting the congressional mandate and U.S. Air Force requirements. And as you know, the final RFP for GBSD was released last week. Northrop Grumman has been a trusted systems engineering partner for every new ICBM system over the last 60 years. We look forward to offering a highly capable, technically measured and affordable solution that addresses evolving threats and fulfills our nation’s critical nuclear deterrence mission. Turning to P&L. At the midpoint of the year, sales were up 20%. As we indicated last quarter, Mission Systems sales growth is accelerating and the top line is stabilizing at Technology Services. Looking ahead, we continue to expect sales of approximately $34 billion for 2019. In addition to solid top line results, our sectors generated a 26% increase in second quarter segment operating income and 70 basis point increase in our segment margin rate, driven by strong performance and cost synergies. Year-to-date, our segment OM rate is up 60 basis points, and we are raising our guidance for the year to approximately 11.5% from low-to-mid 11%. EPS rose 12% on the quarter and we now expect full-year earnings per share to range between $19.30 and $19.55. Cash generation was also a highlight this quarter. Our businesses generated $1.6 billion and after capital expenditures of $252 million, free cash flow totaled approximately $1.4 billion. For the year, we continue to expect 2019 free cash flow of $2.6 billion to $3 billion. And beyond this year, we expect to continue generating strong cash as we grow the business. We continue to execute a balanced cash deployment strategy. In addition to capital expenditures, we increased our quarterly dividend by 10%, we continued repurchasing shares toward our 2019 target, and we will retire $500 million in debt in August. Now turning to the U.S. budget. We are pleased by reports the Congress and the Administration have reached an agreement on fiscal years 2020 and 2021. This should prevent harmful budget cuts and disruption. Predictable funding enabled our customers to increase investment in critical technologies needed to stay ahead of rapidly advancing global threats. We believe our nation’s leaders understand the threats we face and will act to provide the necessary resources to modernize key capabilities. Northrop Grumman continues to invest in advanced capabilities to enable long-term value creation. Our new franchise programs and leading technologies demonstrate the success of our investments and an approach that combines innovation with affordability. We believe that our portfolio and cost structure, our competitive differentiators that is evidenced by our business capture success, will continue creating value for our customers and shareholders. Now, I’ll turn the call over to Ken for a more detailed discussion of our financial results and guidance. Ken?
Ken Bedingfield: Thanks, Kathy and good afternoon, everyone. I also want to thank our team for a strong second quarter. I’d note that our presentation includes an EPS bridge from second quarter 2018 to second quarter 2019, and the bridge to our updated 2019 EPS guidance. As you can see from the bridge on Slide 6, the majority of the EPS increase is driven by a strong year-to-date operational performance and full-year expectations with the remaining $0.10, primarily reflecting lower expected unallocated corporate expense. Let’s turn to the sectors. Aerospace Systems rose 2% in the quarter, reflecting higher F-35 volume in Manned Aircraft and increased civil space activity in space systems. Autonomous sales were comparable to the prior period. I will note, second quarter sales were also unfavorably impacted by the timing of supplier costs. Operating income rose slightly and AS operating margin rate was comparable to last year’s second quarter. We continue to expect AS sales for the year in the high $13 billion range with a mid-to-high 10% operating margin rate. No change to prior guidance. At Innovation Systems, based on pro forma sales comparisons, second quarter sales rose 8% due to higher volume at Flight Systems and Defense Systems. Flight Systems had increased volume on military aerospace structures and launch vehicles. Defense Systems had higher volume in tactical missiles, including the AARGM program. IS operating income was $169 million with a strong operating margin rate of 11.3%. IS year-to-date margin rate reflects several favorable adjustments and the risk [Audio Gap] (15:01) the largest of the businesses grew above the sector growth rate. Increased volume on infrared countermeasures, airborne radar and restricted programs, drove the sensors and processing growth. And higher volume on restricted programs drove growth at advanced capabilities. At Cyber and ISR, we had increased volume on space programs. With previously discussed program completion headwinds behind us, Mission Systems growth rate has accelerated as we ramp up on a number of programs, such as F-35, G/ATOR, CIRCM and IBCS, to name just a few. We continue to expect MS revenue to grow in the low-to-mid $12 billion range this year with a margin rate of approximately 13%. No change to prior guidance. At Technology Services, I’m pleased to report sales were comparable to the prior year period. TS operating profit increased 19% and operating margin rate increased 170 basis points to 10.8%. Looking ahead, previously discussed program completion headwinds moderate in the second half, and we expect TS sales will continue to stabilize. We continue to expect TS sales in the low $4 billion range, no change to prior guidance. And based on strong first half performance, we are again, raising guidance for TS operating margin rates. We now expect a low 10% range versus prior guidance of approximately 10%. As we roll all that up, we continue to expect 2019 sales of approximately $34 billion, and based on strong year-to-date performance and sector guidance increases, we are increasing guidance for total segment operating margin rate to approximately 11.5%. Below segment OM, we now expect unallocated corporate expense of $225 million versus prior guidance of $250 million. Higher segment OM, along with a lower unallocated corporate expense, moves our full-year guidance for the total operating margin rate to the high 10% range. Through the first half of the year, our effective tax rate is 16.4% versus 17.5% at this time last year. Our year-to-date effective tax rate reflects a higher level of research credits than we currently anticipate for the second half of the year. So no change to our guidance for 2019 effective tax rate. As a result of improved performance, we are increasing our mark-to-market adjusted earnings per share guidance to a range of $19.30 to $19.55. This continues to be based on approximately 170 million weighted average shares outstanding. Turning to cash. It was a very strong quarter. Second quarter cash from operations reflects improved trade working capital and higher earnings. Improved trade working capital includes the recovery of first quarter delayed billings that resulted from our ERP conversion to a single instance of SAP covering a majority of our businesses. For the year, no change to prior guidance of $3.8 billion to $4.2 billion cash from operations and $2.6 billion to $3 billion of free cash flow, after capital expenditures of about $1.2 billion. We continue to plan share repurchases of approximately $750 million this year, subject to market conditions. And as previously discussed, we intend to retire about $500 million of debt in the third quarter. Beyond this year, we expect growing cash flows as a result of growing earnings, some improvements in working capital, and our well-funded pension plans. As a result, we expect to have increasing capacity for value-creating capital deployment. In summary, it was a strong quarter, a good first half, and we expect strong results for the remainder of the year. I think we’re ready for Q&A. Steve?
Steve Movius: Thanks, Ken. I would ask each participant to limit themselves to a single question. Natalia, would you please open the line for Q&A?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Myles Walton with UBS.
Myles Walton: Thanks, good morning.
Kathy Warden: Good morning.
Ken Bedingfield: Hey Myles.
Myles Walton: I was wondering on the bookings front, obviously, extremely strong in the first half and particularly here in the second quarter. But I think in the 10-Q you filed, it also shows a slower burn of that backlog, about 40% over the next 12 months as opposed to the 50% over the next 12 months for the last several quarters not a couple of years. Can you talk about how indicative that growth in backlog is about your acceleration of growth given that kind of reduced burn rate, if that’s accurate?
Ken Bedingfield: Yes, let me start with that, Myles. I would just say that we are really happy to see the awards in the backlog that we’ve been able to get in the first half of the year. And as Kathy mentioned, we do expect to see continued strong awards in the second half of the year. I would just point out that a number of the awards we’ve been booking like the B-21, E-2D, which is a five-year multi-year contract, F-35 lots 12 to 14, many of these programs are going to support multiple years of revenue. And so given in particular, the awards booked in the first part of the year, first half of this year, the biggest ones being E-2D, as well as F-35 and then some restricted space activity, we expect those awards to result in sales for a multi-year period and give us really good visibility into strong sales growth for a number of years to come. And so given those – the impact of those large, kind of multi-year awards, we do see that those will result in our backlog turning into sales and about 40% in the next 12 months versus our previous average of about 50%. But it does not give us any pause as to any guidance we have given with respect to 2019 sales or with any indication we have given you about where we think we can be on 2020 sales. And I’ll just remind you, we talked about a mid-single digit range on 2020, but given our awards activity and the opportunities we see in front of us, we think we’ve got opportunity to be in the higher end of that range for 2020. So we think it’s really a good new story and supports, again, this – while we’ve been talking about the level of visibility we have into some long range sales growth for this business.
Myles Walton: That’s great color. Thank you, Ken.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America.
Ron Epstein: Hey, good morning, guys. Good afternoon, actually. Quick question, it’s my understanding that the RFP came out for – through the next phase of GBSD. Can you share any thoughts on what you guys are thinking about it and how you feel about it?
Kathy Warden: Yes. Thanks, Ron. This is Kathy. And as we look at the RFP, which did come out Monday, a week ago, we are really seeing what we expected to see and we are positioned to be able to support the U.S. Air Force requirements and view this as a strong opportunity for our Company as I noted in my own remarks, we have been supporting the ICBM system for over 60 years. So we have the knowledge and the expertise needed to put together a strong offer for the U.S. Air Force, and we look forward to doing that. There is a 150-day response period, so we will be submitting the proposal late this year and still expect an award in the mid-to-late part of 2020.
Ron Epstein: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Peter Arment with Baird.
Peter Arment: Hi, guys. Good afternoon, Kathy, Ken. Kathy, you mentioned the revenue synergies that you’re starting to book. Obviously, a lot has been restricted, so you can’t really talk about it. But I just wanted to talk about how that flows through to growth. Do we expect to start to see that layer in kind of the way Ken described, the burn rate on the backlog or is it something that happens faster? Maybe just some color there. Thank you.
Kathy Warden: Yes. We had talked about revenue synergy really not starting to kick in earnest to 2020, and as mentioned in last quarter’s call, as well as this one, that we are seeing those revenue synergies sooner than we expected. They are on efforts that are restricted and developmental largely, and therefore, you see a fairly slow ramp of that revenue in 2019. You’ll see it more materially happening in the 2020 and 2021 time frame as we’ve talked about previously. As you noted, it is in restricted space and today I shared the Space Norway award because it’s something that’s unclassified and that we can talk about, that demonstrates how in that case Innovation Systems and Aerospace Systems are working together, with IS providing the bus and the integrated ground, and then AS building the payloads for the satellite. And so we’re going to continue to see those kinds of opportunities that are pulling end-to-end capabilities from across our various sectors together in multiple mission areas. But certainly, we’re seeing more of that in space than any other domain.
Peter Arment: Appreciate the color. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Doug Harnett with Bernstein.
Doug Harnett: Thank you. Innovation Systems, and you had what as we would consider to be very good margin performance in the quarter. At the same time, you reported that the percentage of cost-type work had gone up to 29% from 26%. So when you look – first, can you talk about what’s been driving the good performance – the good margin performance that at Innovation Systems? And then as you look forward and think about how you take parts of that business and link it to other – to Aerospace and to Mission Systems to capture revenue synergies, how do you ensure that you can continue to improve margin there?
Kathy Warden: So Doug, let me start and then I’m going to ask Ken to provide some color on some activities in the first half of the year, which won’t be recurring, that did have a positive impact on the IS margins. But more broadly, the good margin performance we’re seeing at Innovation Systems is due in part to their strong performance, and also in part to the cost synergies that we are realizing across the Company. And the more that we’re able to utilize the facilities, the footprint and the infrastructure that we have across the business as a whole, IS and other sectors are benefiting from that. So it’s not just the costs that we’re taking out that I referred to as cost synergy, but also starting to realize some of the operational synergy that’s having a positive impact on margins as well. In terms of our outlook for IS, we expect that strong performance to continue. But as I noted, there were a couple of events in the first half that increased their operating margins. And Ken, I’ll ask you to share – shed some light on that.
Ken Bedingfield: Yes, I would just add that – you may remember, Doug, in the first quarter, we talked about the contribution of some commercial negotiations that we had planned to occur in 2019, but which occurred earlier than we expected driving the Q1 margin up. And then in Q2 largely, we had some positive adjustments on some of our contracts that drove some additional margin rate. And obviously, as we look at the second half of the year, we will work hard to manage risk and realize opportunities to try to continue to drive upside to margin rate, but we’ve had a real successful first half of the year so far, and still need to fill it in for the full year. In terms of the question specifically about the 26% versus the 29%, I would just remind you that the previous-year period only included about three plus weeks of activity. So probably not a material change in terms of the revenue then versus revenue now. But certainly we can perform on cost-type contracts and drive favorably as EAC adjustments there as well.
Doug Harnett: Okay, great. Very good. Thank you.
Ken Bedingfield: Thanks, Doug.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.
Seth Seifman: Thanks very much, and good afternoon. In Aerospace Systems, I guess, in the first quarter, we saw a step up in sales to about $3.5 billion and what you’ve done in the first half and the guidance sort of implies that we’re going to stay at about that level through the end of the year. When do we see the next leg-up in Aerospace revenue? And then, Kathy, on the fourth quarter call, I think you talked in a little bit more detail about the three pieces, Manned, Unmanned and Space. And so maybe if you could talk qualitatively about the outlook, now that you’ve got a few more of these words under your belt for the next couple of years for each of those?
Kathy Warden: I’m going to ask Ken to start with giving you the outlook for the remainder of the year, and then I’ll talk to our overall view of the three segments.
Ken Bedingfield: Yes. So Seth, just a couple of comments, I guess, I would make for AS. I would say that as I referenced in my remarks, we did have that some timing of some supplier costs that moves the rate a little bit from Q2 into the second half of the year. We did have a relatively tough compare for AS growth, which had grown 11% Q2 of 2018 on top of 11% the Q2 before that. So AS has been a solidly growing business and we continue to be comfortable that it continues to grow as we look forward. We’re comfortable with our full-year guidance for AS, and feel good about where we are and where that business is going to be going in the next few years. And I’ll let comment – I’ll let Kathy comment more specifically on kind of the divisions within AS.
Kathy Warden: Yes. So we’ve been seeing growth across the three segments of AS Manned, Unmanned and Space, and each quarter that varies a bit. This quarter, Manned and Space were up offsetting some slight declines and Unmanned, just largely timing of deliveries in that business. As we look forward and over the long-term, we see Space as likely the fastest growing segment of Aerospace. In that we see budget increases in that area, it’s a key area where we’re identifying and executing revenue synergies across the entire portfolio. So I do see that being one of our fastest growing segments in the Company over time. I would say that Manned continues to benefit from a number of key franchise programs like E-2D, the additional work there with the U.S. Navy, but also it will be fueled by the international growth that we noted with Japan. And then of course, we continue with F-35 to see some decent growth in that Manned segment as well. But Unmanned too, will has a nice growth outlook as we take Triton to early operating capability later this year. We’ll be ramping up production on that program over time and we also as you know have strong international demand there with units going to Australia and some interest in Germany as well. So I really see nice opportunity across all three elements for the Aerospace portfolio.
Seth Seifman: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Research.
Robert Stallard: Thanks so much. Good afternoon.
Kathy Warden: Good afternoon.
Robert Stallard: Ken, you mentioned that next year you should have some more flexibility for value-added capital deployment. I was wondering what your priorities might be in that area, and whether pre-funding the pension might have moved up the agenda there?
Ken Bedingfield: Sure. I’ll comment on that. I would say that as we look at the value-creating capital deployment opportunities, I’m probably not going to lay out the specifics for what 2020 might look like until we actually give guidance for 2020, but I would probably reference you to our consistent allocation over the past number of years. In particular, I would note that we’ve been repurchaser of our shares for many years, dating back to 2003. We certainly expect that to continue. We’ve talked about what our CapEx profile looks like. Certainly, we continue to invest in technology through R&D investment and things like that. In terms of pension, pre-funding, I haven’t seen that really rise too high on my radar screen at this point. I would say that we’ve had pretty solid pension returns year-to-date and that should help us from a required funding perspective. And I think if you think back to our previous discussion, we didn’t have a whole lot of funding required for the next couple of years on pension, so not necessarily high on my radar screen. My previous commentary on the debt pay-off in August of this year, we do expect that after we pay that off and then we look forward at our growing EBITDA and cash flows, we have the opportunity to get back to our preferred BBB+ credit rating at that point. So lots of optionality on kind of managing the balance sheet, I would say, from that perspective and just lots of opportunity as we see again a growing set of cash flows to think about what the most value-creating capital deployment is.
Robert Stallard: That’s great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse.
Robert Spingarn: Good afternoon.
Ken Bedingfield: Hey, Rob.
Robert Spingarn: So – hey there. Ken, just on that growing set of cash flows, you talked earlier about the strength of the multi-year awards, and that 2020 revenues could be at the high end of expectations. So it’s becoming clear the double-digit growth for free cash flow per share is possible. So I wanted to – I know you don’t want to get too far ahead of yourself, but how do you feel about the 15% to 20% growth implied in the consensus free cash flow for 2020 of $20 per share?
Ken Bedingfield: Great. Thanks for the question. As I mentioned previously, we’re not ready to give guidance for 2020 at this point. But I think we’ve been clear and I’ll continue to be clear that this is a business that will be a strong generator of cash as we look forward. And let me just walk through a few of the drivers of that for 2020 and beyond. First, as you mentioned, we expect to continue to see solid growth and that’s for multiple years, given our portfolio alignment to what – our customers’ needs and the changing threats, and also as evidenced by our strong backlog. We continue to expect to generate strong margins and convert those margins into cash. We invested ahead of the curve and we continue to expect our CapEx will moderate in future years. Pension plans are well funded to Rob’s question previously, some of the best funded plans in industry, to be frank. And as we look forward, we continue to think that working capital should moderate a bit starting in 2020, and with more opportunity in the out years. So with kind of that framework, I think you’re hitting on the right issues or the right thoughts, and I wouldn’t argue with your thesis or assumptions on solid free cash flow growth.
Robert Spingarn: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Thank you. Good afternoon, Kathy and Ken.
Kathy Warden: Hi, Sheila.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Just on the missiles market, it’s been a big focus lately. Maybe can you talk about Orbital ATK, what it’s thought incrementally in terms of technology and the exposure? And how do you think about the opportunities going forward and maybe your market share today?
Kathy Warden: Thanks. So as we look at the missile space, there is clearly opportunity for us to continue to be key suppliers to Raytheon and Lockheed, which we’ve been doing in more traditional cruise missile space. And as I noted on today’s call, we continue with that partnering in the hypersonic weapons space as well. And then there are some select instances and I pointed to some of those in our prior discussions, AARGM-ER is a good example, where we are the prime provider for the missile. We can provide that full integration and delivery capability, but we also have clearly the specialization and propulsion for other prime missile systems. And so when we think about the business, we really do focus ourselves on continuing to evolve the technology in not only the propulsion systems, but our ability to provide guidance and the other elements of the system, the composite structures, that we can offer to others or in select instances, provide through our own prime offering. We see that area growing for IS, as we see it growing for the other primes as well. And so we think that there is plenty of market opportunity for the three of us in that arena.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of David Strauss with Barclays.
David Strauss: Thanks, good afternoon. Kathy, could you address your competitive win rate within TS, and whether you still think that TS as a whole, can return to growth in 2020? And could you also address your positioning within LTAM’s competition and a sense of that’s going on there? Thanks.
Kathy Warden: Sure. Let me start with Technology Services. Our win rate there in the first half of the year has been very solid, particularly on recompete for we’ve been able to defend the business that we have. And as you know, at the beginning of the year, we laid out a trajectory for that business. The actions that we’ve taken have stopped – stabilized the top line and you’ll also see that we’re increasing the margin rate in that business because the team is executing to that plan quite well. As our guidance indicates, I expect that, that sector is going to be flattish for the remainder of the year and we still expect that the sector will return to growth in 2020. It’s largely driven by still having some headwinds from programs that have exited the Global Services part of the portfolio, while we are growing the global sustainment and modernization part of the TS business. And I just want to also note that TS is providing us affordable life cycle support and modernization for systems and platforms that we build as well. And so they’re an integral part of many of the programs that we have and they offer us affordable options for that services component of the program execution for the bid. So now, turning to the second part of your question around LTAMs, we are in an active competition there with submit to bid. And we feel confident that we have an offer that is competitive and is based on mature GaN technology. So we’ll wait to see what the Army thinks. But we certainly are pleased to be able to participate in that competition and bring forward what we think is a good offer.
Steve Movius: Hey, Natalia, next question.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Jon Raviv with Citi.
Jon Raviv: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. Kathy, I know investments are very important part of the thesis and a differentiator for Northrop. One of your near peers would say, has engagement in M&A where investment is also a part of their thesis too. So, any thoughts or perspectives on size and scale in light of some of those M&A moves and the importance of size and scale in being competitive going forward in the defense market?
Kathy Warden: We’re certainly assessing the implications of the consolidation in our market, but let me share how we think about our own strategy. I see that we have a strong portfolio, especially now with the addition of Innovation Systems, and the portfolio is well aligned to our customers’ highest priority investment areas. As you noted, we have been investing to support value creation. We’ve been investing in technology. I gave one example today, of a multi-year investment stream we’ve had in open Mission Systems Electronics and some of the programs that we’re now winning in Mission Systems as a result of those investments. We, of course, have been investing in the facilities and equipment we need. Many of you have seen the expansion that we’ve done at Palmdale and across our other aerospace centers of excellence over the last several years. And we have a competitive cost structure as witnessed by some of our recent wins and the fighting of our cost advantages in those. So when I look at where we are today, we have that portfolio and a strong basis to support business capture. We also have a strong and improving balance sheet that’s going to continue to allow us this investment optionality into the future. And we’ve demonstrated the ability to compete and win at our current scale. So I see often that the quality of investment choices is even more important than the pure size of the investment itself. And looking at where we are with a focused strategy, well aligned investments to that strategy, I feel good about where we’re positioned.
Jon Raviv: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.
George Shapiro: Yes, good afternoon. I was wondering Kathy or Ken, if you could go through some of the programs that are in unfunded backlog for Aerospace, since that was a big part of the jump in backlog this quarter?
Ken Bedingfield: George, to be honest with you on that one, I don’t have the data in front of me, so I’d have to get Steve to follow-up to you with the specifics on that after the call today. Is there another question, you wanted to go through?
George Shapiro: Yes. The EACs in Aerospace were down – were 54 versus 95 last year. Can you talk through what might have been negative in the quarter, or why it was down by as much as it was?
Ken Bedingfield: Yes, I’d be happy to go through that George. I don’t think there were really negatives of any significant consequence in this year’s second quarter. You may remember that last year’s second quarter, we did have an – a pick up EAC positive adjustments of about $69 million on a couple of restricted programs. So really, if you look at it, it was more positives in last year’s second quarter. And if you think about this year’s second quarter with a similar margin rate, that would tell you that the underlying baseline EAC rates that we’re booking at is stronger than it was for last year’s second quarter. So we feel good about where we are. I’m always careful to put too much credence into the EAC adjustments, because there’s always timing and fluctuations and ups and downs. And I think the most important thing is, we continue to perform. We have not seen an uptick in negative adjustments and continue to deliver consistent, strong performance at each of the sectors.
George Shapiro: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley.
Rajeev Lalwani: Hi, Kathy. Hi, Ken.
Ken Bedingfield: Hey, Rajeev.
Kathy Warden: Hi.
Rajeev Lalwani: Just an F-35 question, Lockheed’s been pretty vocal about getting the price down and it seems like they are successfully doing so, given that it’s one of your biggest programs. How is that faltering down to you on the revenue and/or margin side? And as a follow-up, can you just highlight any contracts that are maybe rolling over the next six months, 12 months, 18 months that could create a little bit of noise, if you will, as we start looking at growth rates moving ahead?
Ken Bedingfield: Sure, Rajeev. I’ll start on that one, and then Kathy can add any color. But from an F-35 perspective, I would just say that we are performing well, we’ve been delivering quality product on time or ahead of schedule. We do have four contracts across a number of sectors, actually we have more than – more than four contracts now with IS and TS starting to see some of the logistics activity and sustainment. So it’s a significant program for us and we’ve been really working hard to support our customer Lockheed Martin, as well as the U.S. government to deliver to that target that has been established from a price per unit perspective. And clearly our cost is a part of the cost reduction that our customer is seeing. So we feel really good about where we are on that program and we’ve seen really solid operational performance and we’re pleased with where that program is at this point. And then with...
Kathy Warden: I think Rajeev, your second question was related to any recompetes coming up in the second half of the year, is that right?
Rajeev Lalwani: Yep, or just simply contracts that are rolling off. Yes, you got the right idea.
Kathy Warden: Right. So we have the remaining headwinds from the Virginia state outsourcing contract that is still in TS through the third quarter, and then we have in our Innovation Systems sector, a contract for Lake City Ammunition Plant and that is expected to be awarded in September of this year. That would be about 10% of the revenue in Innovation Systems and it does not currently have economic value. So there would not be a profit impact, but we are positioning to compete for that contract and are expecting to hear in the next couple of months.
Ken Bedingfield: I would just add that the Ammunition contract that Kathy talked about, has a bit of a longer phasing than most contracts. So probably start – it would start to transition in kind of mid-to-late 2020, although we’ve put together a competitive bid and we’ve got a lot of confidence that we’ll see that production continue to be a part of our business. And on VITA, I would just say that it’s had a more significant impact in the first half of the year and we see it really only about $75 million of headwind as we look at the second half for TS. So not a significant set of contracts that could sort of move against us.
Rajeev Lalwani: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.
Hunter Keay: Thank you. Good afternoon. I’ve got a follow-up on GBSD. Can you help us frame the long-term opportunity for that program, including some of the sustainment work? And then also, please tell me I’m being too nitpicky, but Kathy, why did you include the phrase "technically mature" when you’re talking about the offering in your prepared remarks? And the nature of the question is basically, now that you’ve got a chance to review the RFP, is this less of a science project, if you will? Is there anything in there that would suggest that the customer is looking for proven technology as opposed to more sort of ambitious development work as they think about the award? Thanks.
Kathy Warden: So to frame out the opportunity for you, it clearly starts with the development of the modernized ICBM system and then moves into a production phase over a number of years to actually produce the capability and then would move to sustainment. But that sustainment scope is not part of the RFP for this offering. That’s really – it’s about the development and the production phase of the contract and transition to sustainment. My phrasing on "technically mature" is because we’ve been executing tech maturation and risk reduction program for the last several years on GBSD. And through that process, we have been able to retire risk and really mature our offering, and so we do feel that at this point in time, what we’re able to offer has wrung some of that risk that we would have identified at the early stage of our designed concept out of our offerings.
Hunter Keay: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global.
Pete Skibitski: Good afternoon. Kathy, I wanted to get your thoughts on this idea from kind of early on in the Administration that, we’ve got to look at export control reform that could help with UAV exports. I think it gets to the Missile Technology Control Regime or some other controlling agreement. I was wondering, have you guys seen progress on that or is it still to come, or did it just kind of fall off the table in terms of a major priority for the Administration? So initially I thought that maybe it could be a big opportunity for you guys.
Kathy Warden: Pete, it certainly hasn’t fallen off the table. We’re still engaged actively with the State department and looking at MTCR, and also specifically looking at certain countries that have requested our unmanned systems capability. And I would say that we see much more opening to have that dialog and request from us to come forward with areas that have expressed interest and put some ideas on the table. It is slow to develop those into actual approval for export. And so, we’re still working through a process that requires a lot of steps for us to get there. And so – look at MTCR also requires multi-national engagement to make a change to that policy. So that too, we expected and are seeing that’ll take some time.
Pete Skibitski: Okay. So we should be patient on that front. Okay, thanks guys.
Kathy Warden: We are being patient, but not patient. We’re pushing.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.
Cai von Rumohr: Thank you very much. So Kathy, you mentioned you’re supporting two of your peers on hypersonics. With IS, you now have capability and propulsion, you have capability and guidance. Are you aspiring to become a bigger prime yourself and if not, why not? And also, one of your peers talks about defensive hypersonics as a bigger market. Is that an area that you’re focused on, because there you also looked like you have the technology capability?
Kathy Warden: Yes. Why don’t I start with the second part of your question, because in the counter-hypersonics part of the market, we are establishing ourselves as the prime. We have capabilities in the Missile Defense Regime today and in the space regime that we believe will be highly relevant to counter-hypersonics. So that is an area that we are aggressively pursuing. In the case of hypersonics, thinking of the offense of weapon systems themselves. As I noted today, we do have prime effort. We also are supporting both Lockheed and Raytheon, and that’s an important part of our strategy. We have done an Orbital ATK prior to joining Northrop Grumman, had been a merchant supplier to Raytheon and Lockheed. We got into agreements to support them on certain programs and we are very committed to uphold those agreements and continue to support them with our best and brightest people and technology. As we look forward over the long-term, we certainly will look at every new opportunity as one that we would make a decision, is it right for us to pursue that as a prime or continue to have partnerships and work through the prime of Raytheon, Lockheed and perhaps others that might emerge in this space as well, or both, and offer capability to everyone who is choosing to pursue the marketplace. And so those are decisions we’ll take one by one. We are certainly not looking to take an aggressive stance in that marketplace, because as I said, it’s a growing market and it’s one that we feel is big enough for three parties to adequately play, and we want to make sure that our technology is getting into the hands of the war fighter and that we’re giving them the best capabilities in a timely fashion. And sometimes it makes sense for us to work with our competitors to do that.
Cai von Rumohr: Thank you very much.
Steve Movius: There’s time for one more question.
Cai von Rumohr: Thanks, Kathy.
Operator: Yes. Your final question is from the line of Joseph DeNardi with the Stifel Nicholas.
Joseph DeNardi: Yes, good afternoon. Ken, you talked about your confidence in the cash flow generation of the business and kind of the capital deployment strategy. You guys have one of the lowest dividend yields in the industry. Obviously there two components to that equation. But can you talk about how you think about the dividend either as a percent of kind of free cash flow or total capital deployed, and whether you have a more ambitious plans for that going forward? Thank you.
Ken Bedingfield: Sure, I’d be happy to talk about that. Thanks, Joe. From a dividend perspective, I guess I’ll start with – we simply don’t chase yield and can’t chase yield. That being said, we’ve seen significant increases in our dividend every year for the last number of years. I think it’s been six years or so with double-digit increases. And in fact, two increases. I guess, it was in 2018, two 10% increases or 10% plus increases in 2018. So we’ve been seeing a significant increase in our dividend per share. And I will say that you’re going to think of us as – certainly continue to think about what our future dividend increase would look like. But again, that being said, we don’t – we don’t chase yield and it remains an important part of our capital deployment strategy. We’ve tended to think of it as kind of a range of 30% to 40% of our pension adjusted net earnings. And we’ve tended to be in the middle of the pack to our peers in terms of looking at our dividend based on that measure. And so we think from a yield perspective, we may be a little bit low. But we think from a – again, looking at relative to our pension adjusted net earnings, that we’re pretty squarely in the range in terms of making sure that we have a competitive dividend.
Joseph DeNardi: Thank you.
Steve Movius: Kathy, I would like to turn the call over to you for final remarks.
Kathy Warden: Thanks, Steve. I, once again, want to thank our team for their outstanding performance. Our business capture, our growing backlog, our fruitful investments, they continue to provide the opportunity for long-term value creation for our customers and our shareholders. I also want to thank all of you for joining us for the call today. I hope that you enjoy the remainder of your summer, and I look forward to talking to you again in October. Natalia, that concludes our call.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-04-24 12:45:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's First Quarter 2019 Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. My name is Shelby, and I will be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Steve Movius, Treasurer and Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Movius, please proceed.
Stephen Movius: Thanks, Shelby, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's First Quarter 2019 Conference Call. Before we start, please understand that matters discussed on today's call constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which are noted in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties may cause actual company results differ materially. Matters discussed on today's call will also include non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled in our earnings release and supplemental PowerPoint presentation. And also note a couple of additions to the earnings release. Schedule 4 provides backlog trend information by sector and Schedule 5 provides supplemental per share information to help the quarter-over-quarter comparison of pension and purchased intangible impacts. On the call today are Kathy Warden, our CEO and President; and Ken Bedingfield, our CFO. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kathy.
Kathy Warden: Thank you, Steve, and hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. First quarter results represent a good start to the year as the Northrop Grumman team continues to deliver excellent outcome for our customers and our shareholders. I want to thank our employees for their relentless focus on performance, agility, and profitable growth. Top line growth, strong segment performance as well continued effective capital deployment drove a 6% increase in first quarter earnings per share. As a result, the first quarter performance and our full-year expectation, we are affirming sales guidance of approximately $34 billion and raising our 2019 EPS guidance. First quarter sales grew 22%, reflecting the addition of Innovation Systems and a 7% top line growth in Aerospace Systems. Strong performance at all four sectors generated a 27% increase in segment operating income and a 50 basis point increase in our segment margin rate. The strong margin rates at all four sectors also reflect the cost synergy we are achieving through the Orbital ATK integration which is benefiting all the sectors. The realignment of the TS business areas continue to improve their cost structure and competitiveness as reflected in this quarter's margin rate and our TS guidance increase for the full year. As is our typical quarterly pattern, we were a user of cash in the first quarter. We continue to expect 2019 free cash flow of $2.6 billion to $3 billion. Regarding capital deployment, our strategy continues to call for value creation through thoughtful allocation across our priority of investing in our business, managing the balance sheet, and distributing cash to shareholders through a competitive dividend and share repurchases. Looking ahead, we are on a solid growth trajectory supported by first quarter net awards of $12.3 billion or about 1.5 times book-to-bill ratio. Total backlog increased 7% to $57.3 billion, reflecting 16% growth at Mission Systems and 6% increase at Aerospace Systems. Total backlog is up 35% when compared to March 31, 2018. That comparison reflects an increase of more than 30% at Mission Systems and 11% at Aerospace Systems. At Aerospace Systems, Q1 net award totaled $5.4 billion. In Space, we received a $3.2 billion restricted award. In Manned Aircraft, we finalized the $740 million contract for the U.S. Navy and Kuwaiti F/A-18. And, we were awarded $5.35 million for the F-35. And shortly after the end of the quarter, we signed a multi-billion dollar production contract for 24 U.S. Navy E-2D advanced Hawkeyes. The new multi-year contract includes an option for Japan's purchase of nine additional E-2Ds. Japan has also approved the additional 2Ds in their long-term budget, and we expect that we will be under contract by the end of 2019. At Innovation Systems, the Navy awarded us a sole-source $323 million EMD contract for AARGM-ER, an extended range version of our current missile. AARGM-ER will initially be fielded on F/A-18 Super Hornets and Growlers. It will also be the first supersonic long-range missile to be integrated on to the F-35. And it is expected to be the strike weapon of choice for both the Navy and the Air force. The President's FY 2020 budget includes a request for the Air force variants of AARGM-ER and is called Stand-in Attack Weapon. AARGM-ER is an early example of revenue synergy. Innovation Systems leads the effort with two of our other sectors contributing to the program. This draws from the full breath of our technologies and capabilities for delivering high-speed missile system and demonstrates our ability to work seamlessly across the company to provide needed capabilities to our customers. We expect follow-on production after EMD will be in the multi-billion dollar range. We are currently performing on a number of other high-speed and hypersonic missile programs at the prime contractor and sub-contractor levels which are contributing to IS backlog and sales growth. Turning to Mission Systems, net awards totaled $5 billion in the quarter in airborne radar. MS awarded -- was awarded a contract to equip five U.K. Wedgetail airborne early warning and control platform with our MESA radar. The U.K. joins a number of other international customers in selecting the MESA radar for this capability. In commanding control, MS received a $633 million SMS award to supply our IBCS battle management system for phase 1 of Poland's next-generation air and missile defense. This award aligns Poland with the U.S. Army in utilization IBCS' any sensor, any shooter capability for next-generation air and missile defense. We continue to invest in expanding IBCS' addressable market. For example, during the quarter we and MBDA funded the successful demonstration of IBCS' functionality with a non-U.S. missile system by integrating MBDA's CAMM family of missiles. We did so quickly and at a fraction of traditional missile defense system cost. MS was also awarded $117 million to develop the next-generation radar threat warning system to protect Navy rotatory aircraft. This sensor counters a new generation of highly mobile anti-aircraft weapon and has the potential for international sales. During the quarter, our G/ATOR program achieved initial operating capability and is now transitioning into service. We are currently negotiating a full-rate production contract with the Marine Corp, which we expect will be finalized in the near future. And at TS, we were awarded $52 million for KC-30 sustainment in Australia and $44 million for our battlefield airborne communications node. Companywide, these awards position us for accelerating growth and will be executed over the coming year. Across the sectors on F-35, we are nearing completing of negotiation for center fuselage units, radars, CNI, DAS, aero structures and other equipment for the loss covering the next several hundred aircraft. We continue to aggressively drive affordability on this program while maintaining strong program performance. Now, I would like to spend a few minutes on a major area of opportunity for us, Space. With this addition of Innovation Systems, our Space portfolio is an excess of $7 billion in annual revenue. Our capabilities address end-to-end mission needs including launch, satellites, payloads, ground systems, and commanding control. We are designing and manufacturing systems vital to our national security and continually pushing the boundaries of science and exploration. We are taking commercial applications and technology and creating cost-effective and reliable solution for government partner using Agile processes. We established a resiliency and rapid prototyping space business unit to augment and sharpen our focus on emerging customer opportunities in the new space war fighting domain. A notable outcome from this unit is the R3D2, an experimental satellite for DARPA, which launched from a commercial launch pad in New Zealand in late March. Our R3D2 demonstrated a new type of deployable antenna for small aircraft. This landmark program went from concept to orbit in 20 months. The successful demonstration will lend support to developing additional smaller, faster to launch and lower cost capabilities that can optimize the new commercial market for small inexpensive launch vehicle by both the DoD and commercial users. We're extremely proud of this effort, and I want to congratulate the entire team on its success. I also want to recognize the innovation systems team for last week successful on schedule and on budget, Antares rocket launch of our Cygnus spacecraft. Cygnus delivered 7,600 pounds of scientific equipment and supplies to the International Space Station. This is our 11th launch under the first commercial re-supply contract and we look forward to continued successful missions under our follow-on contract. The President's FY 2020 budget includes increased investments in space, missile defense, nuclear deterrence, artificial intelligence and hypersonic. There is strong bipartisan support for these increased investments to support the National Security Strategy, The National Defense Strategy as well as the framework outlined in the Missile Defense Review. I'm confident that we have the advanced technologies, products and services necessary to support our nation's most critical security mission which are well-funded in the President's budget. As CEO, I'm focused on sharpening our operational efficiency and agility, so that we capture and successfully execute the programs that are portfolio enabled. I'm very pleased at how the team is responding. Our ability to engage with and quickly address our customers rapidly evolving needs with affordable and innovative solutions is critical to achieving our growth potential, creating value for our shareholders and supporting global security and human advancement with our customers. So now I'll turn the call over to Ken for a more detailed discussion of our financial results and guidance. Ken?
Ken Bedingfield: Thanks, Kathy, and good afternoon everyone. I also want to thank our team for a solid first quarter results. I'd note that our presentation includes an EPS bridge from first quarter 2018 to first quarter 2019, a bridge to our updated 2019 EPS guidance as well as a slide highlighting backlog trends. As you can see from the bridge on slide six, approximately $0.15 to $0.25 of the EPS increase is driven by a strong first quarter operational performance and full-year expectations with the remaining $0.15 primarily reflecting lower expected interest expense. Let's turn to the sectors, Aerospace Systems sales rose 7% reflecting higher volume in all three business areas. Operating income increased 12% and margin rate increased 50 basis points to 10.9%. Manned aircraft and autonomous systems programs were the primary drivers of higher sales and operating income as well as margin rate expansion. Restricted F35 and E-2D programs drove higher manned aircraft volume. Higher autonomous sales reflect higher volume across several programs including Triton as that program moves towards full rate production. We continue to expect AS sales to increase to the high $13 billion range with a mid to high 10% operating margin rate. No change to the prior guidance. At innovation systems, based on pro forma sales comparisons, first quarter sales rose 10% due to higher volume in all three business areas as we see the benefits of revenue synergy begin to kick in. In space, higher volume on national security satellite systems drove the increase. Defense systems had higher volume in tactical missiles including the AARGM program as well as higher volume for precision munitions and armaments. And at flight systems, higher sales reflect increased volume on launch vehicles principally ground based Midcourse Defense as well as higher volume on aerospace structures. IS operating income was $167 million and operating margin rate was strong at 11.6%. First quarter margin rate reflects favorable outcomes on certain commercial contract negotiations. We had expected these items later in the year and we're pleased they concluded in the first quarter. We continue to expect IS sales to increase to the high $5 billion range with margin rate in the mid 10% range. No change to prior guidance. Turning to Mission Systems, first quarter sales were comparable to last year's first quarter. Operating income increased 3% and operating margin rate expanded 40 basis points to 13.3%. First quarter MS sales reflect the headwind of approximately $100 million from JRDC and a restricted space program. The headwinds from these two programs are now hardly behind us. The first quarter was also low point from material. We are just beginning to accelerate on a long-term growth trajectory at Mission Systems. This positions MS well for the remainder of 2019 and in 2020 as volume ramps on airborne and space restricted programs F35 and IBCS for Poland just to name a few. We continue to expect MS revenue to grow to the low to mid $12 billion range with a margin rate of approximately 13%, no change to prior guidance. Technology Services sales and operating profit declined in the quarter reflecting completion of the VITA IT outsourcing program, the KC-10 sustainment program and JRDC. The headwind from these three programs was about $125 million in the first quarter. Looking ahead, we expect TS sales will stabilize as these headwinds diminish and we continue to expect TS sales in a low $4 billion range. First quarter performance, we are raising guidance for TS operating margin rate to approximately 10% versus prior guidance of mid to high 9%. As we roll all that up, we continue to expect 2019 sales of approximately $34 billion with a low to mid 11% segment operating margin rate. No change to prior guidance. Guidance for total operating margin rate is also unchanged at mid to high 10%. We are reducing our interest expense guidance to approximately $560 million from our previous guidance of approximately $590 million largely reflecting a revision in our capitalized interest estimate. We are increasing our mark-to-market earnings per share guidance to $18.90 to $19.30. I should say to a range of $18.90 to $19.30 based on approximately 170 million weighted average shares outstanding. Turning to cash, first quarter cash flow is impacted by an ERP system conversion to a single instance of SAP covering the majority of our businesses. My congratulations to the team for achieving this significant operational efficiency milestone. Although successfully completed, the conversion delayed billings and cash receipts of approximately $350 million. We expect full recovery of billings and cash collections in the second quarter. First quarter cash use also increased due to the addition of Innovation Systems which drove $250 million of cash use in the quarter. This seasonal pattern mirrors the rest of the company. We continue to expect strong cash flow in 2019 with no change to full-year guidance of $3.8 billion to $4.2 billion cash from operations and $2.6 billion to $3 billion of free cash flow after capital expenditures of approximately $1.2 billion. We continue to play on share repurchases of approximately $750 million this year assuming current market conditions and as previously discussed, we intend to retire about $500 million in debt in the third quarter. In summary, we expect to continue strong value creation through a combination of continued growth, strong program and a financial performance and robust cash generation, reflecting our growing business, normalization of CapEx and capture of working capital opportunities. I think we're ready for Q&A. Steve.
Stephen Movius: Thanks, Ken. In the interest of time, I request each analyst to lift themselves to a single question. Shelly, please open the line for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Rob Spingarn of Credit Suisse.
Rob Singarn: Good afternoon.
Ken Bedingfield: Hi, Rob.
Rob Singarn: So -- hi, Ken, I guess the elephant in the room here is the sales growth, primarily ATS, but an MS2, so I wanted to ask about the recoveries for both of those. It sounds like from the bookings in your comments just before that, maybe MS starts growing here in the second quarter, but I wanted to check on that, see if that's correct. And then with TS and given that the book-to-bill was below one there, can you really see growth in 2020 is -- I think you said last time, and how do you think about that sector strategically, would you say that the first quarter was below your expectations?
Kathy Warden: So, Rob thanks for the question, and I'll start and then ask Ken to provide more details on the financial, and let me start with the second part of your question first in terms of the positioning at Technology [ph] Services. From a portfolio shaping perspective, and the program losses that we've experienced, which we've been talking about for a while, first West was indicating those and then more recently maybe we certainly saw that those were quite impactful this quarter. A tough Q1 compared to 2018 as we had multiple programs that have rolled off over the last year, including but not limited to KC10, JRDC, and Vito, which we talked about quite a bit. So what we have been doing with that business is really repositioning it for growth. And you are seeing the impact of some of those changes that we made late last year, including the consolidation into two segments. This is positioning the business better for competitiveness in the marketplace and also margin rate performance. And they've delivered that this quarter. So we're going to continue to be a better profile from TS as those programs roll off several of them in this first quarter, and look toward a return to growth for TS late this year. In terms of Mission Systems, you hit the nail on the head, we've seen strong backlog improvement at MS, 30% year-over-year for MS and they are positioned for accelerating growth. They too had two program headwinds that end in the first quarter of this year, and then, largely those headwinds are behind us, and I expect enough to return to a healthy growth rate in the second quarter. Ken, anything you'd like to add?
Ken Bedingfield: I would just say that from a details perspective, TS, we were certainly hoping for a bit of a different outcome in the first quarter. We did certainly understand that there were the headwinds that existed and that represented about 11% headwind for the quarter. So, if you think of without those note items, TS would have been down about 4%, and we were hoping for less than that. So, we'll certainly continue to work hard there to generate the awards that will present for 2020 and beyond. And at MS, I think I would just say, you know, I would reiterate strong backlog, whether you look at from last year's first quarter or even from your end backlog is up 16%. We did have some timing of material recedes [ph] that I mentioned, which had some impact, and I think we feel awfully darn good about how MS is positioned right now.
Rob Singarn: Thank you both.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jon Raviv of Citi.
Jon Raviv: Thank you. Is the implied -- when you talk about growth going forward, would you say the implied kind of exit growth rate this year is sustainable? And then, at least something accelerated 2020, and to what extent really can you do that? And then really admit that growth acceleration, how think about -- how should we think about margin from the mid-high 10 this year, since the margin that's usually mixed-driven, do you see a path to accelerating growth, while also expanding margin? Thank you.
Kathy Warden: So -- thanks, Jon, at the macro level, I certainly see the opportunity for accelerated growth, and we've pointed to backlog a couple of times, but let me also talk about other things that we've done in the business because I think it's important context. We talked earlier in the year about having added an element of our incentive compensation to focus on segment operating margin growth with the full impact that our team will be incentivized to capture profitable sales. We're also winning programs that represent revenue synergy from the IS acquisition, I talked to AARGM-ER this time in the last call; I talked about some of the opportunities in space. And we've started to make some structural changes that better position us for capturing growth. I talked about the TS consolidation, and earlier in this call, I mentioned the creation of the safe resilience and rapid prototyping unit. All of these activities in combination are positioning us to continue with growth and accelerate it over the coming year. So, absolutely see that as possible, and expansion of margins also you saw in the results of this quarter. So, margin expansion, we are taking the cost synergies that are created through the integration of Orbital ATK, and those are benefiting all sectors, and you're seeing that in the result, not just solid program performance, which also continues, but the addition of these overhead reductions that are benefiting the sectors.
Ken Bedingfield: And I think what I would add to that, Kathy, is if I think about the acceleration or the implied exit growth part of the question, I would say, we do feel pretty confident about that, and I think I guess, there are a couple drivers there. One would be you know, we are a long cycle business, and it takes some time for budgets to turn into outlays, and then outlays to turn into our sales. And we certainly try to be careful and thoughtful in terms of how we generate those sales such that we are as efficient as possible and don't motivate [ph] production lines for short-term growth. And then I would also say that where we are aligned within how the budget is positioning going forward, today and dealing with the threats that are identified and the National Security Strategy, National Defense Strategy, Missile Defense Review, we feel good about our capabilities and technology alignment to the mission needs that our customer will face. So, I would say we do feel good about the long-term growth that we've talked about, 2019, 2020 and beyond. And then on the margin expansion, I would say that a couple things, I think we have the opportunity for margin expansion. There are a few things that we need to think about in that regard. Number one, we've been I think effectively managing our cost structure, and that continues. That's a benefit. We also have strong growing production programs, I mentioned Triton getting ready to move into full rate production. That's a benefit. And then we also have a growing set of international opportunities, which should generate a nice margin. Going the other way, we have some margin rate pressure in terms of continued growth and development programs, both in national security space and hypersonic, as Kathy mentioned. So that could put a little bit of pressure on the margins. And if there were a big win, like a GBSD, as we've talked about before, that could have some impact as well, but we do certainly feel confident about maintaining strong margin rate and having a nice set of growing margin dollars consistent with what we see on the top line.
Jon Raviv: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from George Shapiro of Shapiro Research.
George Shapiro: Yes, good afternoon. Could you tell us how much F35 revenues grew in the quarter? And then also, will this be one of the best quarters of the year because with your high-end of your guide at 1930, 506 is obviously more than 25% of the of the year, or are you just providing conservative guidance
Ken Bedingfield: On the first question, George, I don't remember the precise F35 sales growth number for the quarter, but I will say that, I believe our largest program in the range of 9% to 10% of sales, we do see F35 growth that all four of the sectors, AS with the center fuselage, MS radar C&I and other equipment and then IS with air structure is in TS for sustainment. And for the year, I think we see that growing across the company at a rate of high single-digit growth. And then with respect to your question on EPS, I would say that, look, we continue to try to burn down risks as we worked through the year and realize opportunities, such that we can find ways to look at where we can ultimately get to an EPS. In terms of first quarter, I would say that we had solid operational results in terms of margin rate, and we look at that as giving us the opportunity to perform a bit better in our range, segment margin and total margin range that we previously talked about. And then, we had the reduction in the interest expense. So, Q1 is a solid quarter, a good EPS number, will continue again to try to find those risks to burn down. And I guess the only other thing to remind you of is that Q4 does tend to be a heavier quarter for corporate unallocated. And so that could drive a little bit more cost into fourth quarter than we normally see in the first three, so I would say that's the way to think about it, George.
George Shapiro: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Carter Copeland with Melius Research.
Carter Copeland: Hey, good afternoon, everyone.
Ken Bedingfield: Hey.
Kathy Warden: Hi.
Carter Copeland: Kathy, this may be somewhat of a too nuanced of a question, but I'm somewhat intrigued about the insertion of the word agility into your prepared remarks. And the press release. I went back and looked at that in terms of General, performance statement over the last couple years. And that's not a word that comes up. And so, it sort of strikes me as a particular point of emphasis. And I wondered if you might elaborate a little bit on what that means for all the simultaneous efforts you outlined in the previous answer to the question?
Kathy Warden: Yes, thank you. I would like to talk about agility in a couple of contexts. First, our ability to rapidly identify new solutions to help our customers and you've heard me talk about that and how important it is to the profitable growth in our company and also realizing the revenue synergy with the acquisition of orbital ATK. And I'm quite pleased to see the team responded in the way that they are to very rapidly put together the components of our portfolio and meet customer needs. I also talk about agility in the speed at which we are able to work with our customers today. I gave the example of our 3D2, and the fact that we were able to get something from concept on orbit in space in 20 months. So when we think about the way we deliver, we're also implying agility, to our operation. And this helps us to be more competitive in the marketplace. But it also aligns to what are our customers are talking about, in a need to address the threat at the speed of relevance. So as the threat is advancing speed of capability to mission is absolutely essential. And Northrop Grumman is well positioned to do that, with those components of our portfolio, and with our operations. We're just continuing to streamline those operations, so that we can move even more quickly.
Carter Copeland: How do you benchmark that?
Kathy Warden: The way I benchmark it is against the performance expectations that our customer has. So if a customer believes he should take a certain amount of time to get a capability, fielded, if we can beat that we're going to have a competitive differentiation. I benchmark it internally in terms of our own processes, in looking at the cost at which we deliver those services, but also the speed at which we deliver those services.
Carter Copeland: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from David Strauss of Barclays.
David Strauss: Thanks, good afternoon.
Ken Bedingfield: Hey, David.
David Strauss: The 25% to 30% of the portfolio that's restricted. Could you talk about how that grew in the first quarter.
Ken Bedingfield: I'm not sure. I've got that number off the top my head, David, in terms of first quarter growth. What I will say is that a few things, one, we do believe that the restricted portfolio is particularly well aligned to our customers' needs in terms of what they are focused on today and those threats. And we do expect that for 2019 and for sort of the long run we believe that the restricted portfolio will likely grow faster than the unrestricted portfolio. And I would say we expect that at the macro-customer level as well as at the north of ground level. And it's -- I can't say a lot about it but it is a strong portfolio that will likely turn into continued opportunities both from a customer relationship perspective as well as the potential to accelerate what happens in those programs to future phases be at AMD to production or whatever it may be. And so we feel really good about the portfolio and maybe just to point out a couple of things, for Q1 and Steve can certainly follow up later on with the number, but we did talk about growth at innovation systems and national security space, most of which would be restricted and certainly growth at aerospace systems where we talked about restricted. And then also comments at Mission Systems with respect to a few areas where they will see restricted growth in the next three quarters of the year and into 2020.
David Strauss: And then you highlighted the backlog growth at Mission System. Kathy anything, I think you previously talked about mid single-digit top line growth in 2020. Would you expect MS to lead that growth among the three businesses, or sorry, business segments?
Kathy Warden: As we look to the remainder of this year, MS will be a strong contributor to the growth in the Company.
David Strauss: Okay, thank you very much.
Kathy Warden: Yes.
Operator: Your next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu of Jefferies.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Good afternoon, Kathy and Ken. Thank you. Just on that, I guess on MS, you were awarded IBCS for Poland in the quarter. How do we think about the ability to leverage some of these programs to both grow the international business, and just when we think about other franchise opportunity?
Kathy Warden: Yes, I see good opportunity particularly in the Mission Systems portfolio. And I noted a few of them today, you mentioned IBCS as Poland and I talked about also the work we did with MBBA to demonstrate the ability to integrate an international missile with our missile defense system. I also see portability for gater [ph]. We talked about a new sensor that we're developing that has international applicability in MS as well. So across the board, we have had strong export business in Mission Systems and I see that potential continuing to grow. And we also have global operations, in particularly, Europe, and Australia that are continuing to grow across the portfolio, but particularly with opportunity in Mission Systems as well.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Great, thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from Seth Seifman of JPMorgan.
Seth Seifman: Thanks very much, and good afternoon. So, I wonder if you could tell us, I mean historically you guys were a pretty good performer on working capital. I know things kind of move around quarter-to-quarter. So, this quarter is an anomaly. But now that we've got innovation systems in there, what's -- let's say, at year-end period, what's the appropriate level of working capital for the business, I don't know if you can size it as a percentage of sales or any way that you're comfortable?
Ken Bedingfield: Sure. Yes. As I mentioned in our prepared remarks we do think that there are working capital opportunities in front of us. As we look at 2019, we probably see more opportunity from a working capital perspective, quite frankly in 2020. I think as we grow the business in '19, we see the ability to either grow working capital at a similar rate or potentially slightly less, but we do see some opportunity to liquidate some working capital in 2020. And I would say that NGIS had a little different working capital structure than we did some of that is structural say NASA, CRS. Those payment terms are going to be, but they're going to be there's opportunity to burn some down -- some other programs and then we'll just continue to diligently work day to day to make sure that we get the right payment terms for the type of work that we are performing and the contracts that we're signing and just continue to stay focused on that. And then also, we need to continue to work with our customer and make sure that their payment terms are appropriate again for the type of contract and the type of work. And we would like to see opportunity on that side, as we continue to work with them for again appropriate industry wide payment terms.
Seth Seifman: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Hunter Keay of Wolfe Research.
Hunter Keay: Thank you. Hi, everybody. I think you talked about this $1 billion submarine subsystems systems award. Is that really to Columbia class, I'm sorry. And can you remind me of your total exposure -company exposure to shipbuilding and how you expect that to trend over the next few years? Thanks.
Ken Bedingfield: Sure. I wouldn't be able to comment on specifically the class of submarine, but what I would say is that we did reach an agreement in the quarter for about $1.3 billion, some of that had been previously recorded as long lead to provide a number of units for our propulsion and turbine generators in support of the U.S. Navy Submarine production and we do expect that to be delivered over a number of years. In terms of the overall exposure to shipbuilding, I would for us probably frame that in the range of mid-to-high single digits in terms of sales maybe bit more like mid single digits.
Hunter Keay: And you expect that to stay roughly there over the next say five to ten years?
Ken Bedingfield: I don't expect. Based on what we do in that area, we don't tend to see a lot of volatility. I think there is an opportunity for growth as we think about the Columbia class as you asked about, there are some other areas, we will provide capability for surface ships, electronic equipment and things like that on surface ships as well as some seaborne radar capability and, may be some opportunity for growth, but probably not one of the fastest growing areas in the Company.
Hunter Keay: I see. Thank you, Ken.
Operator: Your next question comes from Robert Stallard of Vertical Research.
Robert Stallard: Thanks so much. Good afternoon.
Ken Bedingfield: Hey, Rob.
Robert Stallard: Ken, a quick question for you on cash, is there any way you can fix this seasonality that you see in this cash make it little bit level loaded throughout the year?
Ken Bedingfield: We're working on it Rob, I would say. There are some, I'd call them structural timing of certain payments and receipts that we see that make that a little bit of a challenge. There are just certain outflows that occur early in the year and we have always tended to have a strong fourth quarter and we're always working hard to pull more cash from next year into this year that means you're going to do it all over again. But we're looking at strategies, I don't see us ever get into a point where we're level but we can certainly be significantly better than we were this year we had a couple of notable challenges as I mentioned this year. And we can do better, but I wouldn't expect us to be kind of ratable across the year.
Robert Stallard: Okay, thanks so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ron Epstein of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Ron Epstein: Hi, good afternoon, guys.
Kathy Warden: Hi, Ron.
Ron Epstein: Kathy, as we think about the next couple of quarters. Can you give us a little, maybe insight baseball on what programs we should be keeping an eye on? What are the shorter-term opportunities that could as outsiders, we should be keeping on eye on that you guys could potentially when?
Kathy Warden: So Ron, as is usually the case, a good bit of the work we continued to pursue and even what we talked about winning in this first quarter is restricted. So while I can't point to specific opportunities. We are seeing growth in Hypersonics and the programs that we have already won will continue to have opportunities for increased scope. We have national security space, which is a number of restricted programs, some of which we booked in the first quarter and we referenced in today's call; others that are pending awards later in the year. We also have opportunities that are more public. Clearly, the launch services agreement that we are under today and working with the year forced to compete for the down to be launched one of two launch services providers for national security launches. And then we have TBSD, which we are competing for and we expect the RFPM later this year that will be awarded next year are just a handful of areas that I would suggest that you monitor with that.
Ron Epstein: Okay, great. And then maybe for follow-on related, when you think about the budget request from the administration and kind of maybe where we are through the process of the Armed Services Committee, House Armed Services Committee coming back with response, how do you feel about that budget relative to how you're positioned?
Kathy Warden: I feel very positive about our alignment to the budget even after we look at the Congressional process that is going to into. We have strong alignment to the threats and being able to address areas that are certainly of note. We've talked about a number of them today Hypersonics, artificial intelligence, the continual progression of sensors that can detect advanced threats which impact both our Mission Systems business, are continuing growth in the weapons and high-speed metals area. I talked about AARGM-ER today, and I see a strong alignment to the capability that will be needed in the future and both the Navy and the Air Force have expressed interest in that and full as a missile of choice. So, as I look at how those programs are supported in this budget, I see very strong alignment around the areas that we've been investing in and progressing our portfolio to fulfill and the budget. And the budget is very much based on the national defense strategy and that strategy is enduring and we expect it to continue to be the view of both parties that we need to align to that strategy and ensure that we're dealing with the threats of particularly China and Russia.
Ron Epstein: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Rajeev Lalwani of Morgan Stanley.
Rajeev Lalwani: Hi, Kathy. Hi, Kenneth.
Ken Bedingfield: Hey, Rajeev.
Rajeev Lalwani: Two quick ones, if I may. One, just curious on Algeria stay and how you're feeling about it as time has evolved and you've digested? Yes. Then unrelated to have become a back something you said earlier on the missile defense side, can you talk about Patriot and your involvement in the satin soften in the potential opportunity on the radar, that's a potential here on the domestic side?
Kathy Warden: Sure, I'll actually start with the latter. And as you might guess, there isn't a lot that I'm going to say about an active competition other than the fact that we are participating in the sense off. And so we're looking forward to offerings of competitive solution that meets the requirements. Shifting to GBSD, we have been working with the government as you know on the risk reduction contract EMR that is going well. We have received draft of the RFP for the next phase of GBSD and so we are in earnest working our proposal. There's nothing in the draft RFPs that have been a surprise to us. And we continue to work to put in place a very competitive offering for the Air Force and expect that proposal to go in later this year, and as I noted in the earlier comments to be awarded next year.
Rajeev Lalwani: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Peter Arment of Baird.
Peter Arment: Yes, thanks. Good afternoon, Kathy, and Ken. Kathy, maybe you could just give us a couple of comments or metrics that you can and the innovation and systems integration process? Where are you today? And are you on track for kind of the goals that you set up when the deal was achieved? Thanks.
Kathy Warden: Yes, the integration continues to progress exceptionally well. I'm proud of how that team is performing. We had set cost synergy targets to reach $150 million run rate by the end of 2019 going into 2020. We are on track to achieve that. And as I said, some of the performance improvement that we've seen across the sectors even in this first quarter, our results of those cost synergies starting to be reflected in the sectors. We also are starting to see revenue synergy realized and when we first laid out the business case behind the deal, we did not anticipate seeing revenue synergy quite as quickly. So both in Space and Missile we've pleased at how quickly those have progressed. And then we also when we laid out the deal with all of you talked about operational synergies and these are areas like facilities overlap that we have within the portfolio that we have an opportunity now to rationalize with the addition of Orbital ATK and we are making good headway on those operational synergies as well, again even faster than I had anticipated. We've been able to identify some opportunities and realize those this year, so all-in-all, feel very positive about the performance of the business as well as the integration process that we're executing.
Peter Arment: Great, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Myles Walton of UBS.
Myles Walton: Hey, good afternoon. Kathy, I was looking at the changes of incentive metrics on new leaders come in and you mentioned one of those with the insertion of segment operating margin growth. And I guess there was a little bit at the emphasis on the weighting of margin rates, and I think Ken touched on that. But the other incentive you added was RONA [ph] and I'm curious, the last time this was in the mix was prior to the spin-off of shipbuilding and was probably a pretty good indication of how the company was thinking about relative asset returns. So I'm curious when you included this new metric, what exactly are you trying to motivate and sense with the addition of this particular one?
Kathy Warden: So, let me start and then I'll have Ken add a little bit of color on the measure as well. And what we are looking to do is incentivize the top team and I should note that this metric has been in place for most of our leadership as part of our incentive plan. We added it for the top leadership team has the component of the long-term in incentive and we are working to drive performance in the elements of the business that leadership can control in terms of both returns but also managing the assets of the business and we focused more on the operating assets of the business, so that we aren't penalized the team for areas like goodwill and the issues that come with making an acquisition as we just did. And all I can detail that a little bit more for you, but really it is getting the team is focused on the operations of the business. I also added another element of our non-financial goals on operational efficiency and that is meant to streamline our processes, speed, decision making, so that we're able to operate more efficiently and effectively inside the corporation and it goes back to the comments I was making and Carter questions about agility.
Ken Bedingfield: Yes, just a couple comments I would add there, Myles. We essentially focus our incentives around growth from a profitable growth perspective, not just growth for growth sake which is why we like the segment, margin dollars as a growth metric. We also have cash generation, as a significant measure in both our annual and long-term plan. And then with respect to your question on sort of RONA in the old days, I think what you maybe remember in the old days wasn't economic value add metric. We actually have had RONA for some period of time and then two years ago we moved from RONA to what we call operating RONA and think of operating RONA as essentially a return on working capital, and we didn't want to try to dilute the -- our ability to create value through managing the balance sheet by including things in there like goodwill and intangible assets and, and those things that are more challenging for the team to manage, obviously on a day-by-day basis. So, we essentially created a metric that is, return to, to working capital and we call that operating RONA.
Myles Walton: Okay…
Stephen Movius: I think we have time for one more question.
Ken Bedingfield: Sorry, Myles.
Myles Walton: No worries.
Kathy Warden: Thanks, Myles.
Operator: Your next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.
Cai von Rumohr: Yes. Thanks so much. So Kathy, on the fourth quarter call, you talked about B21 being flattish this year. And yet it looks like it was up in the first quarter. Has anything change their and secondly, you…revenue growth is a key issue. What sort of backlog growth should we see in the remainder of the year to tell us this is going to happen in the future? Thanks.
Ken Bedingfield: Let me let me start on that, Cai, and then, Kathy can add some commentary. I would say that looking at Q1, we did see some higher volume on restricted programs within manned aircraft. And I wouldn't want to comment beyond that as to what that might be. In terms of the B21 program I would say, that's been one of our fastest growing programs for the last few years. And we continue to think that the profile we talked about for the full year 2019 is appropriate. In terms of awards, I would say that, Kathy mentioned, a multibillion-dollar, multi-year award on the E-2D that we got in April, we're certainly expecting another significant award as we look forward on working with Lockheed on F35, and that would be across a number of sectors. And then, Kathy mentioned, an option for nine aircraft on E-2D over Japan. We do think that is likely to come later in the year. And then also, we did highlight a significant restricted award in the quarter, and we're looking at some continued restricted awards in the balance of the year. So I think there is a really solid story here, not just the first quarter. But as we look forward into 2019, and I'll just remind you that we are a long cycle business and in particular, multi-year awards will turn themselves into sales over a longer period of times. But, we're gaining confidence and our ability to continue to grow as we look forward.
Cai von Rumohr: Thank you very much.
Stephen Movius: Let's now turn the call over to Kathy for final comments.
Kathy Warden: Thanks, Steve. I'll end the call again by thanking the Northrop Grumman team for their outstanding performance and commitment to deliver growth and provide long-term value for our customers and shareholders, and I want to thank everyone for joining us on today's call. That concludes the call. I'll speak to you in July.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2018 Q4  (2019-01-31 12:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's Fourth Quarter and Year-end 2018 Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. My name is Natalia, and I will be your operator today. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Steve Movius, Treasurer and Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Movius, please proceed.
Stephen Movius: Thanks, Natalia, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2018 Conference Call. We will refer to a PowerPoint presentation that is posted to our IR web page during Ken Bedingfield's remarks. Later today, we plan to post an updated corporate overview to the Investor Relations webpage. Before we start, please understand that matters discussed on today's call, including guidance, expectations and current thinking on revenue, earnings and cash trends, constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to safe harbor provisions of federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which are noted in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties may cause actual company results to differ materially. Matters discussed on today's call will include non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled in our earnings release and supplemental PowerPoint presentation. Specifically, as of December 31, we adopted the mark-to-market method of accounting for our pension and other postretirement benefits. For consistency and comparability of our results and 2019 guidance, our references to adjusted net earning and adjusted earnings per share on today's call will refer to earnings and EPS adjusted for the mark-to-market impact.  These are non-GAAP measures. We define mark-to-market adjusted net earnings as net earnings excluding the impact of mark-to-market expense or benefit and its tax-related impacts. We believe the supplemental measure is useful as it depicts our results before the nonoperational impacts of pension and other postretirement benefit actuarial gains and losses, and is consistent with how management measures underlying performance, determines incentive compensation and provides guidance. Table 1 in the earnings release reconciles non-GAAP operating measures to our GAAP results, and Schedule 6 of the earnings release provides recast historical information for years 2016 and 2017, and quarterly recast information for 2018 for the mark-to-market method of accounting. On the call today are Kathy Warden, our CEO and President; and Ken Bedingfield, our CFO. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kathy.
Kathy Warden: Thank you, Steve, and hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. In addition to reviewing our results and highlighting some of this year's important operational achievements, I'll discuss our outlook for 2019 and also provide some color on how we're currently thinking about trends into 2020. First, I'll thank our Northrop Grumman team for their continued focus on performance and growth. The efforts of our employees enable us to continue delivering excellent outcome through our customers and shareholders. 2018 was another strong year for our company. This year's capstone achievements was the completion of the Orbital ATK acquisition in June and the stand up of Innovation Systems as our fourth sector. The transaction was immediately accretive to earnings, and I'm very pleased to report that as we continue to successfully integrate IS, we are on target for cost and operational synergies and trending favorably on revenue synergies.  The addition of Innovation Systems, along with the organic growth at Aerospace Systems and Mission Systems, drove a 24% increase in fourth quarter sales and a 16% increase for the year. I would also note that 2018 international sales increased to $4.4 billion or 15% of total sales, reflecting growth at all 4 of our sectors. Our strong sales growth in those periods, coupled with segment operating margin rate expansion, drove a 43% increase in segment operating income to more than $925 million in the fourth quarter, and a 19% increase for the full year. In addition to the contribution for IS, operating income increased at all three legacy Northrop Grumman sectors in the fourth quarter, and segment operating margin rate increased to 11.4% for the quarter and 11.5% for the full year. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter increased to $4.93 per share and 2018 adjusted earnings increased by more than 50%. New awards in 2018 were robust at more than $32 billion. Book-to-bill at Mission Systems was particularly strong at 1.2x. We ended 2018 with a total backlog of $53.5 billion, which reflects $8.2 billion in backlog at Innovation Systems. We also had strong cash generation. Before discretionary pension contribution, 2018 cash from operations increased by $1.1 billion to more than $4 billion, and free cash flow before discretionary pension contribution increased to approximately $2.8 billion. Our strong cash generation enabled us to continue investing for profitable growth, managing the balance sheet and returning cash to our shareholders. We continue to invest in CapEx, retired legacy Orbital ATK and Northrop Grumman debt, and made voluntary contributions to our pension plans. Through share repurchases and dividends, we distributed $2.1 billion to shareholders or approximately 80% of free cash flow. These distributions reflect 2 increases to our quarterly dividend totaling 20% and share repurchases of $1.3 billion. The $1 billion accelerated share repurchase that we announced in November was completed in early January. The ASR retired 3.84 million shares at an average price of approximately $260 per share. Now turning to operational highlights. I'll start with the F-35 program. All 4 of our sectors participate in this program either through production or sustainment. In 2018, F-35 revenue across the company totaled nearly $3 billion, approaching 10% of sales, with the vast majority of that coming from AS and MS. At Aerospace, F-35 revenue increased 25% in 2018. We achieved a 1.5-day production interval and we delivered 121 units, which was 47 more than in 2017. At Mission Systems, we delivered 125 multifunction radar arrays, 830 DAS sensors and approximately 4,400 CNI modules, which represented an increase in year-over-year F-35 sales at MS of approximately 10%. At the company level, we expect F-35 sales will grow at a mid- to high single-digit rate in 2019. A key highlight at Aerospace was higher revenue for restricted activities in Manned Aircraft, which drove top line growth in both periods. We expect 2019 revenue from a restricted program and Manned Aircraft to be roughly equal with 2018. This revenue profile is consistent with that of a major defense development program post-critical design review that is executing successfully. Regarding other areas of growth at AS, we are in discussions with the Navy on a second multiyear contract for the E-2D program. Our first multiyear for 30 planes is progressing toward completion. With the success of the first multiyear production contract, the Navy requested a new multiyear proposal for up to 40 aircraft over five years, including additional aircraft for Japan.  We're also in discussions with Boeing on a fourth multiyear proposal for the F/A-18 program. The fiscal year [indiscernible] plan now has the program of record extended through FY '23 for a total of 110 additional aircraft. And at Mission Systems, in addition to the F-35 achievements, we also continue to ramp up production on the SABR radar program. The SABR team has now secured orders to date totaling 441 systems. 73 systems has been delivered through 2018. The F-16 Air National Guard upgrade program is progressing on schedule. Initial production deliveries will begin in March of 2019 in preparation for initial operational capability shortly thereafter. With additional SMS awards, we are solidifying SABR's position as the leading airborne active electronically scanned array fire control radar for international customers. Also at MS, the Air Force awarded us a $3.6 billion ID/IQ contract for LAIRCM, our large fixed-wing infrared countermeasures system. Under the ID/IQ, the Air Force may issue task or delivery orders for system and support up to the ceiling amount with work under the contracts set to conclude in 2025. And in our rotary aircraft countermeasure business, the Army plans to field over 1,500 CIRCM systems to support training and deployment on helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft around the world. CIRCM offers significant size, weight and power advantages in comparison to traditional systems. The program is progressing toward operational testing and full rate production. Mission Systems is currently performing on LRIPs 1 and 2. With respect to cyber, MS recently competed for and won the unified platform effort supporting U.S. cyber command. We will develop, build and deliver the core underlying war-fighting capabilities enabling integrated offenses and defensive cyber operations for U.S. cyber command. At Innovation Systems in the fourth quarter, we successfully performed a ground firing test of the abort motor for NASA's Orion spacecraft launch abort system. The completion of this milestone brings Orion one step closer to its first flight, and enabling humans to explore the moon, Mars and other deep space destinations. In late 2018, we received 1 of 3 OTAs to compete for the development of the OmegA rocket for the ultimate down-select to two providers for the Evolvable Expendable Launch Vehicle program. The first phase of this program is to develop launch solutions in order to have at least two domestic launch service providers that meet national security space requirements. At Technology Services, we received a number of important competitive awards in 2018. We received a $200 million award for this coming Social Security Administration, where we are expanding our long-term support under the ITSSC program. Our Australia business also received approximately $200 million of new awards, and we started new work on several strategic activities supporting Northrop Grumman products through their full life cycle. We've taken numerous steps to position TS for the future. And as we look to ensure we are maximizing operational efficiencies and continuing to posture for growth two TS business areas: Advanced Defense Services and System Modernization and Services has been consolidated into a single new business area called Global Services. Global Services includes working software sustainment, development, modernization, secured networking, cloud and IT infrastructure, training systems, and cyber operation. As we look across our portfolio, in the context of the country's evolving national security needs, we remain very well positioned. With our R&D and capital expenditure investments, as well as the addition of Innovation Systems, our portfolio has the advanced technologies, products and services necessary to support missions highlighted in the National Security Strategy and the National Defense Strategy. We are also well aligned with the framework outlined in the recently released Missile Defense Review. Our unique capabilities in space, missiles, counter-hypersonics, and cyber, and our emphasis on agility, allows us to support our nation's evolving national security missions. Now let me briefly address the partial government shutdown and the FY '20 budget outlook. We are encouraged that many federal agencies, including the Department of Defense, started fiscal year 2019 with budgets in place. However, other important customers including NASA and the Department of Homeland Security, were shut down and now are operating under a continuing resolution until February 15. While we have not yet seen a significant financial impact, this could change if there is another shutdown or long-term continuing resolution. While the FY '20 budget request has not yet been finalized, we are encouraged by the focus on modernization and the prioritization of the capabilities outlined in the National Defense Strategy, including our nation's nuclear recapitalization. However, unless Congress and the President agree on a budget deal, the spending cap established by the Budget Control Act will return for fiscal years 2020 and 2021. While we anticipate a deal will once again be reached, the caps could significantly reduce spending for defense and non-defense activities. So turning to 2019 guidance. We expect double-digit sales growth in 2019 to approximately $34 billion, while maintaining strong segment operating margin, reflecting mid-single-digit organic growth, along with a full year of Innovation Systems. Assuming continued strong support for national security spending, and the capabilities outlined in the National Defense Strategy, we currently expect mid-single-digit sales growth to continue in 2020. Our team is incentivized to provide strong results, and we're confident that we can achieve the consistent top line growth, strong margin performance and robust cash flows that should enable value-creating capital allocation and solid double-digit adjusted EPS growth from our 2019 guide to 2020. I'll now turn the call over to Ken for a more detailed discussion of our financial results, guidance and trends. Ken?
Kenneth Bedingfield: Thanks, Kathy, and good afternoon, everyone. I also want to thank our team for this year's strong performance. Today, I'll spend a few minutes on 2018 results, and also discuss our 2019 guidance in more detail. As I review 2018, I'll remind you that prior periods are recast for adoption of the accounting standard updates for revenue recognition and pension cost presentation both adopted at the beginning of 2018. We also recast for our previously announced mark-to-market pension accounting change. Turning to sector results. Aerospace Systems sales were up 6% for the quarter. 2018 sales grew to more than $13 billion, up 8%. While restricted activities and the F-35 program of Manned Aircraft drove a substantial amount of the year-over-year increase, all 3 AS business areas, Manned Aircraft, Autonomous Systems, and Space, posted higher year-over-year revenue. I would note that the top line of AS has grown about 30% since 2015 and that the team has done a great job of maintaining strong performance while managing rapid growth. AS operating income increased by 12% in the fourth quarter and 9% for the full year, driven by sales growth and improved performance for Manned Aircraft and Autonomous Systems. For the full year, we achieved a strong 10.8% margin rate, again principally driven by Manned Aircraft and Autonomous Systems program performance. For 2019, we expect AS to grow its top line at a mid-single-digit rate to the high $13 billion range. Our top line guidance calls for continued growth in all 3 business areas. We expect a mid- to high 10% operating margin rate at AS in 2019. At Innovation Systems, based on pro forma sales comparisons, fourth quarter sales rose 7% due to higher volume at Flight and Defense Systems. For the year, sales increased 17%, driven by growth in all 3 business areas, including a more than 20% increase in international sales. For 2019, we expect IS sales to increase to the high $5 billion range. Growth in 2019 U.S. sales is expected to approach 10%, but will be partially offset by lower international sales. 2019 international sales are expected to decline by about 20% as a couple of shorter cycle programs that ramped up in 2018 are now winding down. However, we expect solid international growth beyond 2019 as it remains a key part of our IS growth plans. We expect 2019 margin rate at IS will be in the mid-10% range. Turning to Mission Systems. Fourth quarter and full year sales rose 2%, primarily driven by growth in Sensors and Processing programs. Sensors and Processing fourth quarter volume was up 8% due to higher volume on communications, F-35 and restricted programs. For the year, Sensors and Processing growth of approximately 9% reflects higher volume for restricted, communications, F-35 and electro-optical infrared self-protection programs. As we've discussed throughout 2018, these gains were partially offset by the ramp-down of a restricted ISR program and lower volume on a JRDC program. I would point out that Sensors and Processing represents about half of MS sales. Mission Systems fourth quarter operating income rose 17% and operating margin rate increased 170 basis points to 13.1%. Higher volume at Sensors and Processing and improved performance at Cyber and ISR, and Advanced Capabilities, drove the strong performance. For the full year, operating income rose 5% and operating margin rate increased to 13%, reflecting higher volume at Sensors and Processing and improved performance in Cyber and ISR, and Sensors and Processing programs. For 2019, we expect Mission Systems' top line to grow at a mid-single-digit rate to the low to mid-$12 billion range with continued strong operating margin rate of approximately 13%. We expect top line growth from all 3 business areas in 2019. Technology Services fourth quarter and full year 2018 sales both declined 8% due to ramp-downs in several programs we've previously discussed, primarily JRDC and KC-10 in both periods. Lower revenue for these programs is being partially offset by growth in other programs such as SEMA. Technology Services fourth quarter operating income increased 62% to $115 million or 10.8% margin rate, principally due to contract closeout impacts at a state IT outsourcing program. For 2018, operating income decreased 1% due to lower volume, partially offset by a higher margin rate, which increased to 10.3%, largely as a result of the noted contract closeout impacts. For 2019, we expect Technology Services sales will be in the low $4 billion range, with a mid- to high 9% operating margin rate. As we roll all that up, we expect sales of approximately $34 billion, with a segment operating margin rate in the low to mid-11% range. We expect our total operating margin rate will be in the mid- to high 10% range, reflecting the operating portion of the net FAS/CAS pension adjustment of about a $400 million benefit and unallocated corporate expense of approximately $636 million. 2019 unallocated corporate expense reflects noncash intangible asset amortization and PP&E step-up depreciation of $386 million and $250 million of other estimated unallocated items, of which approximately $50 million is related to the ongoing integration of Innovation Systems. On pension, our 2019 FAS assumptions are based on a 4.31% discount rate and an 8% expected long-term rate of return on planned assets and exclude any mark-to-market impact. Slides 5 and 6 in our PowerPoint deck summarize our pension estimates for years 2019 through 2021, and Slide 7 summarizes 2019 sensitivities to changes in assumptions. I'd also note that our guidance contemplates interest expense of approximately $590 million. 2018 other income included about 6 months of interest income on over $10 billion of cash as well as a couple of nonrecurring gains, so I'd caution you about modeling a similar result for 2019 other income. We expect an effective tax rate of mid-17% in 2019. And our mark-to-market adjusted earnings per share guidance of $18.50 to $19 is based on approximately 170 million weighted average shares outstanding. On Slide 9, we provided a bridge from 2018 adjusted EPS of $21.33 to our 2019 adjusted EPS guidance of $18.50 to $19. For 2019, we expect higher segment operating income of about $1.70 to $1.90 per share due to profitable growth at legacy Northrop Grumman sectors and a full year of Innovation Systems. Lower CAS recovery reduces EPS by about $1 and lower FAS benefit reduces EPS by about another $1. I would note that the lower CAS recovery is an example of our relentless focus on structural affordability and sustainable competitiveness as our team is working all aspects of pension asset and liability management.  It's important to note that the reduction in CAS recovery also resulted in a dollar-for-dollar reduction in our required funding, which is less than $750 million in total over the next 3-year period as you can see on Slide 6 in the charts. To continue with the bridge and get off my pension tangent, we also expect higher 2019 unallocated corporate expense will reduce EPS by about $1.70. This includes the 2019 benefit of the sizable cause claim settlement and a full year of 2019 amortization of purchased intangibles and PP&E step-up depreciation. Looking at taxes, the increase in our 2019 tax rate to mid-17% versus 13% -- 13.7% in 2018 is an impact of about $0.70. The lower 2018 tax rate reflected prior year and other benefits. That should help you bridge EPS from 2018 to 2019. Regarding cash, as is our typical pattern, we had a strong finish to 2018. Before $280 million of pretax discretionary pension contributions, cash from operations was a little more than $4 billion, and after CapEx of about $1.25 billion, our free cash flow totaled nearly $2.8 billion. In 2019, we expect cash from operations of $3.8 billion to $4.2 billion, and after capital expenditures of approximately $1.2 billion, we expect free cash flow will range between $2.6 billion and $3 billion. I'll remind you that 2018 cash flows benefited from the seasonality of IS cash, which are heavily weighted to the second half of the year. For 2019, we are planning share purchases of approximately $750 million, assuming current market conditions, and we intend to retire about $500 million in debt. Our capital expenditures peaked in 2018, and given what we see now, should begin declining incrementally to about 2.5% of sales in 2021. Based on all of these factors, this business should be a strong generator of free cash flow into 2020 and beyond. I'd also note that the vast majority of cash will be generated by our operations. Given our current assumptions, we expect CAS recoveries of $770 million, $850 million and $1.1 billion in 2019, '20 and '21, respectively. For example, at the midpoint of guidance, 2019 after-tax net pension recovery, defined as CAS, less funding, is about 15% of cash from operations. This cash profile is shown on Slide 10. Our required funding is approximately $90 million in '19, $220 million in '20 and $410 million in 2021. And while required contributions will likely increase after 2021, they are not expected to exceed CAS. So as Kathy said, we expect to continue strong value creation through a combination of growth, performance and robust cash generation as well as thoughtful capital allocation.  I think we're ready for Q&A. Steve?
Stephen Movius: Thanks, Ken. [Operator Instructions]. Natalie, will you open the line?
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question is from the line of Rob Stallard with Vertical.
Robert Stallard: So Kathy, a question on your comments. You said that in the Manned Aerospace area, the restricted program -- a restricted program, was expected to level off this year. Can you give us some idea of how this area is expected to progress beyond 2019? Are revenues likely start to accelerate again from 2020? And is there any change in the margin profile as well?
Kathy Warden: Rob, I appreciate the question. I'm limited in what I can say about the program to which I'm referring, but I did want to provide all of you some insight into how it factors into our current year guidance, 2019. And so my comments were, that we see sales leveling off, and that, that is consistent with what we would typically see in a program that's executing well and is completed its critical design review. Beyond that, I really can't comment any more on what we expect, either in future years or about the performance of the program.
Robert Stallard: Okay. Can I try something else instead, then?
Kathy Warden: Yes.
Robert Stallard: Okay. You mentioned Innovation Systems at the export side of things are seeing some strong growth this year, stepping down again 2019 and going back up again. I was wondering if you could give a bit more clarity on what exactly those products or services are that are moving around.
Kenneth Bedingfield: Rob, I would just say that we had some strong growth in 2018, largely on the defense systems side of the business related to some munitions and other weapons programs. And those ramped up in 2018 and are starting to ramp down here in early 2019, largely just driven by timing of the orders and then the deliveries were made. And we do expect that we'll see a continued strong growth out into 2020 and beyond. So just timing, but good programs and good opportunities as we look forward.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Ronald Epstein: You gave us a little bit of color based on trends on revenue and EPS into 2020. Can you speak to like the cash flow trend as we think about that with kind of what you would expect free cash flow to do? And then, there is an expectation, I think, among investors, that at some point, you will see growth accelerate above where it is, given the programs you're on. How should we think about that? And I guess, that's probably [indiscernible] your question, but at least if you could give us some flavor on that.
Kenneth Bedingfield: So Ron, it's Ken here. Maybe I'll take it in reverse order. In terms of the growth profile, I would say that yes, we're very happy about how we're positioned, I would say, very closely aligned with the National Defense Strategy, National Security Strategy, missile defense review, and other areas of focus for our country that deals with this ever-increasing view of threat from peer, near-peer countries. And we do expect that, that will drive a nice growth profile as we look out past '19 and past 2020. At this point, I wouldn't want to put a number on it, a lot of moving parts between here and there. And I would say that ours is a long cycle business, and it takes time to generate revenue out of some of these awards and move some of these early developments. This early development growth we're seeing out of the NDS and other areas and turning those into ultimate production. And you want to take your time. You want to get it done right. You don't want to perturbate your production lines or your factories just to try to drive volume for a short period of time. So we take a measured long-term approach to it, and we're quite satisfied with the profile we see. From an EPS perspective, again, we do see strong growth. Kathy mentioned what we saw the length of '19 to '20. And from a cash perspective, obviously, the longer you go out, the harder it is to predict from a cash basis. But we do think that this is a strong cash-generating business that we ought to be able to generate, turn our earnings into cash as we think about our working capital. Just as maybe one example, we see working capital in 2019 probably growing with sales. And then, in 2020, we see, potentially, some opportunity to reduce some working capital as we have some programs that we invested in, in the past that should start to generate a better cash profile. And then, I mentioned a couple of other things, including relatively low level of CAS funding and a declining amount of CapEx in dollars as well as in a percentage of sales. And I would just encourage you to take that information and use it to model what you think our cash would look like. We're probably not going to put a number on it beyond 2019 at this point.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: In terms of -- on AS, can we talk about margins and leverage a little bit coming in light? What mix factors are driving it? And how do we think about it in '19 and beyond?
Kenneth Bedingfield: For AS, from a margin perspective, Sheila, I would say we're quite happy with how that team has been performing. They've taken on a lot of early phase development work and they've maintained strong margin rates throughout. As we look at 2019 guidance for margin, and maybe looking out beyond as well, I would say, we're guiding '19 kind of in the range of where we were in 2018. And the biggest drivers of margin, obviously, are mix and performance. So if that team continues to perform and we're able to continue to burn down risk and realize opportunities on some of our programs, we could see some additional upside as we look out from a margin rate perspective. I would just point out that AS sectors taking on some additional early phase development opportunities, is not just the one program that people tend to think about. And so that will continue to certainly provide a generation of growth for future production, but also probably keep margin rates somewhat range-bound to where we see it today, of course, with the risk and opportunity management providing some level of upside as I mentioned earlier.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.
Noah Poponak: So I want to come back to this topic of your target or commitment to outgrow your end market on a multiyear basis. And I don't know where you'll go, given what you've said so far here. But it didn't happen in 2018. 2019 up -- call it up 5 organically isn't quite -- based on what it looks like, authority steering, translating outlays, based on what some of your peers are doing, it's not really definitively happening in '19. The comment of mid-single digit in 2020 sort of, again, based on what it looks like outlays are going to do and what some other companies are saying. It kind of looks like a 3-year window here of that comment of outgrowing your end market actually not really happening. And I know you have the transitory, you could call it transitory TS stuff in there, for part of that time. I don't think you have that in 2020. And so from where we sit, we just constantly get the question from investors, what specifically do they mean by the end market? What specifically is the variance to the end market? And why isn't it happening in realtime as you are projecting that for your business?
Kathy Warden: Noah, I'll start, and Ken can add in as well. When we look at the growth trajectory of our business, we do look at it over the long term. And we talk about long term, our business cycles, particularly with AS and, to a lesser extent, IS and MS, tend to be beyond 3 to 5 years. And so when we win a large program, it takes time for us to ramp up to a normalized state of revenue generation for development. And then, that tends to plateau a bit before we get into the production phase where there's another ramp process that goes on. And what you've seen from us over the last couple of years is some significant ramps associated with taking on new work. Those, when we talk about long term, we're really talking about 5-plus years. And so in any given year, you may not see a year-to-year transition at the equal rate of growth as you did in the past. And so that's what we mean when we talk about long term. Now let me talk about where we are in the alignment with the NDS. We are seeing new programs come into the portfolio. They start relatively small, and so they are not moving the needle with the same rate as some of our large programs that we have talked about. But they do create the platform then for growth to 3 to 5 years out. And so that's what we wanted to give you a sense of in terms of not just talking about 2019 guidance, but the trends that we see into 2020. And over time, you will see those develop into more material program that represents the growth that we've been talking about on a long-term basis, an alignment with the investment account.
Noah Poponak: Yes. I mean, I guess it sounds like it's a high -- maybe, a very high degree of confidence in duration that you can see with substantial visibility, maybe even beyond five years down the road that you are sustaining the current growth rate versus a big step function at some point in the pace.
Kathy Warden: When you have long cycle programs, you tend to look at them over a decadal view rather than a given annual view. And so yes, that is what we're talking about. And of course, there's uncertainty that comes with that in terms of the commitment to those programs over the long term, which is why we don't tend to guide more than a given year. However, we have seen good alignment in the National Defense Strategy to the programs that we are talking about that create that foundation for our view that we're well aligned. And the threat environment is really what drives our confidence that we have the portfolio that lines up well, not just for today, but into the future.
Kenneth Bedingfield: And Noah, I would just add, I think your comment is on point. You certainly want to think about your production rate and production lines, and how much you might have to invest to drive that capacity sooner rather than over the next couple of year period. I would just point out that if you think about it, AS has been growing significantly, right? 30% since 2015, nice growth in 2018. Obviously, IS had a great growth rate in 2018. MS, if you exclude some of their headwinds from JRDC and our restricted ISR program has grown about 6% in 2018. We're looking at probably 6% in 2019. And TS, we expect will be in the low $4 billion range in '19, and then, flatten and start to grow in '20. So I think, overall, we feel pretty good about it. I think you're right, there's a real nice long-term trajectory here. And I would just think about it a little bit in that bigger sense in terms of how restructure was doing as well as we talked about the international business at IS, that as a part of that big 17% revenue growth that's going to have a little pause here in 2019.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Carter Copeland with Melius.
Carter Copeland: Just one quick one, and then, we're off of revenue. Just talk about a simplifying assumption, Kathy. Just looking at the Q4 commentary, you didn't call out any big risk retirements of significance in AS, but obviously, you went through the B-21 critical design review successfully. Is it safe for us to assume that your performance was approximately in line with what you had assumed? Or is there any reason to think that, that wouldn't be the case?
Kathy Warden: That would be a fair assessment, Carter. When we think about programs and our booking rates, we take into consideration what we know about performance. And so we tend to incentivize the team not to have large variation. And when they are performing well, there is very little volatility in our booking rate position, based on performance.
Carter Copeland: Okay. That's what I would have assumed. I just wanted to make sure there wasn't something missing.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.
Seth Seifman: I wanted to talk about Aerospace Systems for a moment, and just, you mentioned some of the components in terms of F-35. I think you said mid- to high single. And then, if Manned Restricted is not growing, I would think that kind of takes the whole segment down further. And so if you think about the other pieces there, sort of what's enabling you to get to kind of the 5% to 6% that you're forecasting.
Kenneth Bedingfield: Thanks for the question, Seth. I would say, yes, if you think about it, we've got F-35 in there at, as we mentioned, mid- to high single digit. We certainly see growth opportunities across the portfolio of autonomous Systems, growth in the Space division, particularly in the area of restricted space, addressing some of the new requirements like resiliency and other things. So largely nice growth across the portfolio at AS. Some new development work that I mentioned, addressing some of the areas of the National Defense Strategy. And then, continued growth in some other production programs. I think E-2D has nice growth in 2019 and beyond. Triton is in production and we see that progressing nicely on a growth profile. And so I think it's pretty diverse across the portfolio there.
Seth Seifman: And then, maybe just a follow-up real quick. Does F-35 flatten out in '20? And then, you've resumed growth in Manned Restricted?
Kenneth Bedingfield: My thought on F-35 is we should continue to see growth in 2020, probably more in the mid-single-digit range. And that growth should continue. Ultimately, production will level out. And as prices continue to decrease, you would see production reach a peak. But the sustainment volume at that point should start to fill in that gap, and we would expect to see a pretty sustained amount of revenue on the F-35 as we look forward. We do expect that given our position on a program, whether it's at AS or at MS across the various Electronic Systems, that it is only among that we would expect to see our fair share of sustainment revenue over the life of that program.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Peter Arment with Baird.
Peter Arment: Kathy, you mentioned some consolidation efforts on TS. Maybe you could just give us some further your thoughts around whether you see other consolidation opportunities within TS, any -- either M&A or in particular, portfolio shaping that you're thinking about in 2019 and beyond.
Kathy Warden: Thanks, Peter. So in TS, I mentioned the consolidation of 2 businesses into 1, Global Services, and that is intended to create a more competitive integrated services portfolio that focuses on high-end services for IT as well as analytics and operations in the areas of cyber, health care, and intelligence. And that business has really, as it's come together, been able to lay out a platform for transitioning to growth after just executing a strategy to get out of lower-end services and IT outsourcing. And so I'm proud of what the team has accomplished there. We now have that segment positioned to begin growing and a competitive set of capabilities and offerings that we can bring to the market. So my intention this year is to enable that team to grow. We, of course, have NTS already been growing in the logistics and modernization piece of the business. And we expect that growth to continue both domestically and internationally. And so the 2 pieces of the business are both aligned through good performance, not just in '19, but in beyond.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley.
Rajeev Lalwani: I wanted you to just help me reconcile the comment earlier about an expectation for revenues to start accelerating more materially, but at the same time, having CapEx start to decelerate pretty materially. Is that just Northrop going through some sort of harvesting process around spending that's been occurring? Or is there something else going on? And then, how would something like GBSD come into play if you were to win that and the implications for the spending side and some of those numbers, Ken, that you provided earlier?
Kenneth Bedingfield: Sure. I wouldn't want to call anything at what we're doing as harvesting. I guess, what I would say is, that, in my view, we saw the ability to grow this business, and we saw the investment it was going to take to position ourselves for that growth and to drive the programs and to drive the performance that we're seeing today. And given those investments that we made, we are able to grow the business off of that investment, or facilities. We've invested in production lines, engineering tools, all those things that it takes to grow the business. So we've invested to get to the trajectory that we see. That's why we're starting to get on to the downslope of our CapEx profile, while we're continuing to see a nice solid growth profile. And with respect to GBSD, we will see potentially some additional CapEx driven by a GBSD win. But I'd expect that will be post-2021 before we would see that CapEx profile. And then, as we continue to grow the business, I don't see it largely perturbating our ability to fit within the out-year profile that I talked about from a CapEx perspective. Could be a blip for a year or 2, but I don't see it largely perturbating our long-term thoughts on that front.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.
Hunter Keay: Curious if you could give us the total company sales or earnings mix that you say -- that you would say comes from missile defense, post-OA? And what's the growth rate you might expect to generate over the next few years in a base case? And also, best case scenario, knowing what you know about current opportunities and what you expect?
Kenneth Bedingfield: So on our -- I guess, I don't have that particular number in front of me. We are going to post an updated company overview deck to our Investor Relations site this afternoon after the call. And Matt will have a fair amount of detail in it mixed by sector, by division, by major products, and things like that. So I think we do see a nice growth profile from a missile defense perspective, much of it, I would say, at MS and IS. Certainly, IBCS is one that we see having nice growth, both U.S. and internationally. Kathy, I don't know if you want to add anymore on that side of it.
Kathy Warden: Yes. Hunter, I'd just take you back to the missile defense review and the capabilities that are outlined in there from a space layers and support, tracking and targeting, to the missile capabilities needed and different weapons classes, the counter-hypersonics capabilities required. All of those capabilities are ones that we contribute to through every sector in our company, but as Ken said, most prominently through IS and MS. And so we look at our portfolio through the lens of capabilities, and you'll see that in the company overview, but you'd have to take pieces from every part of the company and assemble them as they would line up against what's being required to support in the full defense mission.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Myles Walton with UBS.
Myles Walton: I was hoping, maybe, Ken, you can talk a little bit about the IS margins. Year-on-year, you're looking for flat. I think, obviously, the sales came in stronger in '18 than you would otherwise would anticipate it. But the margin is flat year-on-year, given kind of the integration, the synergies, I would imagine if flowing to the business. Can you just talk about that? And also, Kathy, are you still on track for the $150 million of synergy run rate in 2020?
Kenneth Bedingfield: Sure, I'll hit on that this first question, and turn it over to Kathy. I would say that, look, our guide for IS is kind of consistent with where they were for the full year of 2018. We're just 6 months in the integration here. We've forecasted some of those integration costs at the corporate line, but some of those could certainly hit the sector so we're thinking through where those costs are going to flow through. And some of the synergy benefits, whether they're costs, operating or revenue synergies, also will be realized by the other sectors. So you got to look at kind of the bigger picture as all of the sectors will realize some of the integration benefits. And I'll let Kathy comment on the integration process as she's been leading that for us the last year or so.
Kathy Warden: And yes, Myles, I'm very pleased with where we are on integration, both the cultural integration that's occurring as well as the integration of our operation. As Ken noted, we are on track for the cost synergies that we defined going into '19 and expect to largely have recognized those in early 2020. We are also above our expectations of where we thought we'd be at this point in both identifying revenue synergies and fitting work together that could result in revenue synergy for not just IS, but the other sectors as well. As I look at the process that we took where we are leveraging the best of both cultures and processes into Northrop Grumman, the team has really stepped up and responded. We've been able to continue to perform exceptionally well as you see now in our 2018 results, while also doing the back office integration that's so necessary to being able to operate as one company. And so just seven months in, I couldn't be more delighted with where we are in the integration process.
Kenneth Bedingfield: And Kathy, I apologize. One other comment I should make on IS margin is, their mix is trending a little bit higher towards development work as they're also seeing some volume come out of the National Security Strategy, particularly international space -- national security space business as well as hypersonics. So that drives the margin rate down just a touch, but certainly positions them well for a new future production.
Operator: Your final question is from the line of David Strauss with Barclays.
David Strauss: I wanted to follow up on that on IS, and actually about the working capital opportunity there. Ken, I know you mentioned kind of 2020, a tailwind -- potential tailwind for free cash flow from working capital. Can you just talk about how you view that working capital opportunity at IS? Is it as large as it would appear based on when the company was on its own?
Kenneth Bedingfield: As I think about the working capital, I would say that as an industry, we've been building some working capital as we've seen some of the cash terms structurally in the DFARS work a little bit against us, in particular, on some of the longer cycle production programs where deliveries aren't made for, in some cases, years down the road. And we carry a fair amount of working capital until we get to liquidate upon delivery and DD-250 of those products. I would say that legacy Orbital ATK or NGIS saw similar increases in working capital based on that trend. But also, they have some structural areas where they had invested in programs like A350 and in the CRS program. And some of those will start to have a better cash profile as we look at 2020. They also had agreed to make some investments that should start to ramp down here in 2019. And we expect that, that will also have a bit of a benefit on cash as we look at 2020 and beyond. So we're working it both on our side and on the NGIS side. And I think that our team is probably one of the best managers of working capital in the industry, and we expect them to continue to be successful in that regard.
Stephen Movius: At this point in time, Kathy, I'd like to turn the call over to you for final remarks.
Kathy Warden: Thanks, Steve. I'll conclude today's call by once again thanking our team for another outstanding year of performance for our customers and our shareholders. I'm just honored to be leading such a talented and dedicated team of men and women at an important time for our company and to our national defense. So thank you all for joining our call today.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Northrop Grumman's Third Quarter 2018 Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. My name is Jamie, and I will be your operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Steve Movius, Treasurer and Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Movius, please proceed.
Stephen C. Movius - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thanks, Jamie, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's third quarter 2018 conference call. Before we start, please understand the matters discussed on today's call constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities Laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which are detailed in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties may cause actual company results to differ materially. Matters discussed on today's call may also include non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled in our earnings release. We have posted a slide deck to our IR website that summarizes our guidance, updates the three years of pension information we previously provided, and includes a five-year schedule of amortization of purchased intangibles and the step-up in depreciation of acquired property, plant and equipment. On the call today are Wes Bush, our Chairman and CEO; Kathy Warden, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Ken Bedingfield, our CFO. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Wes.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thanks, Steve. Hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I want to start the call by thanking our entire team for their continued focus on execution and performance. Our third quarter results demonstrated robust performance with topline growth and strong operational execution. The quarter included the first full quarter of results for Innovation Systems. Based on our strong performance, we're increasing our guidance for the year. Kathy and Ken will review the operational and financial results. I'm delighted to note that for the first time in a decade, the Department of Defense begins this fiscal year without a continuing resolution. The fiscal year 2019 defense appropriation bill received very strong bipartisan support, passing the Senate with a 93 to 7 vote. We view this support as well as the administration's focus on accelerating innovation efforts as signals that the Congress and the administration are aggressively addressing the threats emerging across multiple domains and are increasing our nation's pace of modernization and investment. Our own programs continue to be well supported in the budget, and our portfolio is well-balanced between mature franchise production efforts and the development programs that will ultimately lead to the next generation of production programs. In the context of an improving budget environment, we've aggressively invested in supporting our customers' need for advancing capabilities, including the addition of Innovation Systems, while also driving affordability. We're focused on performing on our current programs and pursuing attractive new programs in our robust opportunity set. Overall, I'm very pleased with our team's year-to-date accomplishments, and I'm excited about the many opportunities before us. I'm also excited about the future of our company under Kathy's leadership. She has demonstrated a solid focus on creating value for all of our stakeholders, and she brings the leadership capabilities and values to lead our great company forward. So, let me turn the call over to Kathy to give us an update on our third quarter results. Kathy?
Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thanks, Wes. Good afternoon, everyone. Wes, I want to first express our gratitude for the way you've led our team in creating value, while always maintaining the highest standards of ethics and integrity. On behalf of the entire Northrop Grumman team, we thank you.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thanks, Kathy.
Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.: My comments today will address third quarter financial and operational highlights for each of the sectors, including a status on our Innovation Systems integration. Beginning with our financial results, the businesses generated solid topline growth and strong segment operating income and margin rates during the quarter. Sales increased 23% to $8.1 billion, reflecting a full quarter of Innovation Systems, as well as continued topline growth at Aerospace Systems and Mission Systems. I'd also note that international sales rose 22% year-to-date and we ended the quarter with total backlog of $52.6 billion. We continue to see strong demand from international customers. At the end of the third quarter, Japan announced their decision to purchase an additional nine E-2D Advanced Hawkeyes, bringing their total planned E-2D purchase to 13 aircraft. Third quarter segment operating income increased 29% and our segment operating margin rate increased 60 basis points to 12.1%. In addition to this quarter's strong operating performance, third quarter financial results benefited from the settlement of cost claims as well as a lower tax rate. These factors combined to generate a 78% increase in third quarter net earnings and earnings per share. As a result of our strong third quarter and year-to-date performance, we are increasing our guidance for 2018 earnings per share to a range of $18.75 to $19.00. Turning to cash and capital deployment, our strategy remains the same: Invest in the business, manage the balance sheet and return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. During the quarter, after reflecting the discretionary pension contribution, cash from operations totaled $812 million and $1.45 billion year-to-date, and free cash flow was $530 million for the quarter and $664 million year-to-date. Based on those year-to-date results, we are increasing our guidance for free cash flow to a range of $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion. So now, let me touch on our sector highlights. At Aerospace Systems and Manned Aircraft, we continue to ramp up on restricted activities and the F-35. We're on track to deliver 116 F-35 center fuselages this year, which represents a 25% sales increase over 2017. In Autonomous Systems, we announced the delivery of a Global Hawk autonomous aircraft carrying the Battlefield Airborne Communication (sic) [Communications] Node, or BACN, to the U.S. Air Force. We have received another contract to augment a BACN-equipped Global Hawk with the capability to link fifth generation fighters with fourth generation fighters and forces on the ground. Global Hawk will be the first operational aircraft to provide this valuable capability. And in Space, the Northrop Grumman team was down-selected to compete for the mission satellite payloads on the Next Gen OPIR GEO missile-warning system. The competitive phase of the program will include development scope through critical design review. This successor program to SBIRS, on which we were the payload incumbent, is an example of the Air Force's go-fast acquisition strategy to develop Advanced Capabilities. The final down-select is expected at the end of 2020. At Innovation Systems, shortly after the end of the quarter, we were awarded a $792 million launch services OTA for the development of the OmegA rocket for the evolved expendable launch vehicle program. This agreement runs through 2024 and includes certification flights of OmegA's intermediate variant in 2021 and its heavy variant in 2024. Three providers were selected in this phase to develop commercial launch solutions in order to have at least two domestic commercial launch service providers that meet national security requirements. IS also supported two important launches during the quarter; the Parker Solar Probe and the final Delta II launch deploying NASA's ICESat-2 satellite. The Parker Solar Probe launch included the first ever third-stage propulsion system for the Delta IV heavy rocket. The ICESat-2 launch represented the 132nd, and final, Delta II mission for Innovation Systems. Innovation Systems has successfully completed the first qualification test for its new rocket motor, the GEM 63, for the United Launch Alliance Atlas V after beginning the development just three years ago. The successful completion of this test enables full production to begin with a first drop-in scheduled in next summer. Regarding integration, we remain on track to meet or exceed our cost reduction target and we continue to be very excited about both the operational and revenue synergies we expect our combination to yield. At Mission Systems, topline growth continues to be driven by Sensor and Processing programs. During both the quarter and year-to-date, we had higher volume on restricted electro-optical/infrared self-protection program, communications, the F-35 and the SABR radar. We achieved several significant program milestones during the quarter. In addition to F-16 SABR upgrades for multiple customers, MS successfully installed a production SABR radar on a Marine Corps F/A-18C, demonstrating our AESA radar's capability without aircraft systems and highlighting SABR's flexible and scalable architecture. We are competing to upgrade approximately 100 aircraft for the Marines. Also, during the quarter, we achieved important milestones on three development programs, CIRCM and G/ATOR in Sensors and Processing and IBCS in Advanced Capabilities. Our work on all three programs demonstrates our ability to develop affordable, modular, open-system architectures that improve capabilities, while also reducing total life-cycle costs. On the Army's Common Infrared Countermeasure System, or CIRCM, we achieved milestone fee after undergoing rigorous testing, signifying our system maturity and production readiness. We are now moving to production on this critical life-saving technology for the Army's helicopter fleet. We received the low rate initial production order in the third quarter. We also delivered the seventh G/ATOR, ground-based radar system ahead of schedule to the Marine Corps. We look forward to successfully executing G/ATOR's full rate production program, which is scheduled to begin in 2019. In Advanced Capabilities, the Army awarded our missile defense team a $289 million contract to continue system design and development toward fielding the IBCS, which represents a paradigm shift for the Army's integrated air and missile defense. We are working toward a flight test in late 2019, and you will recall that we also have a letter of agreement with Poland to acquire IBCS in conjunction with their Patriot purchases. At Technology Services, our global logistics and modernization work continues to grow as we ramp up on programs like SEMA and managed total life cycle solutions for Northrop Grumman platforms and those of other OEMs. And we also captured the re-compete of the Army's Mission Command Training Program valued at $336 million over more than four years. We've taken numerous steps to position TS for the future. And as we look to ensure we are maximizing operational efficiency and continuing to posture for growth, we will be consolidating two of our TS business areas, Advanced Defense Services and System Modernization and Services into one unit beginning in 2019. Our company is on a positive vector. We are well-positioned to our customers' needs and we're demonstrating our ability to grow and create shareholder value. We will be providing 2019 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call in late January. But looking ahead, we remain focused on achieving above-market, long-term profitable growth with strong accompanying cash flows. We're confident that our current portfolio of programs, our domestic and global opportunity set and the revenue synergy potential of Innovation Systems supports our positive outlook for 2019 and beyond. So now I'll turn the call over to Ken for a more detailed discussion of our financials and our guidance.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thanks, Kathy, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll add my thanks to our team for their performance and I'd also like to thank Wes for his outstanding leadership. I'll briefly review our third quarter and year-to-date results and update our 2018 guidance. Overall, it was a good quarter with solid awards and sales with strong margin rates and earnings growth. I'll cover the sector results and guidance for the remainder of the year, then move to below-the-line corporate items including pension. Turning to sector results, Aerospace Systems sales rose 5% in the quarter and are up 9% year-to-date. Higher volume during both periods continues to be driven by higher Manned Aircraft volume, principally restricted activities, and ramp-up on the F-35. Autonomous Systems sales were also higher during both periods as we continue to ramp up on Triton production. Volume for Space was slightly lower for the quarter and year-to-date. Aerospace operating income is up 9% for both the quarter and year-to-date. Third quarter operating margin rate increased 50 basis points to 11.5%, primarily due to improved performance in Manned Aircraft and Autonomous Systems programs. Year-to-date margin rate is 10.8% comparable to last year. While AS margin rates continue to reflect a higher level of early phase development work, we're quite pleased with the year-to-date performance. Based on year-to-date results, we are increasing AS sales guidance to a range of $13 billion to $13.2 billion and we now expect AS will have a mid-to-high 10% operating margin rate for the full year. Moving to Innovation Systems, third quarter sales totaled $1.4 billion, which, when compared with the pro forma results for last year, represents a 16% increase. Third quarter sales were higher across all three IS business areas. Defense Systems sales reflect increased armament systems and missile products volume. Higher sales for Flight Systems were primarily due to increased volume on propulsion systems and launch vehicles. The increase at Space Systems reflects higher government satellite volume. Operating income totaled $161 million or 11.4%. Based on year-to-date results, we are increasing IS sales guidance to a range of $3.1 billion to $3.2 billion with a mid-to-high 10% margin rate. Moving to Mission Systems, sales rose 3% for the quarter and 2% year-to-date. High-single-digit growth in Sensors and Processing activities, for both the quarter and year-to-date continues to be the primary growth driver for MS. Underlying mid-to-single digit growth at MS is being partially offset by JRDC and ramp down on an ISR program. Mission Systems' operating income increased 11% in the third quarter and 2% year-to-date. Third quarter operating margin rate increased 100 basis points to 13.7%, and reflects improved performance across all three business areas. Year-to-date, operating margin rate of 12.9% is comparable to year-to-date 2017. For 2018, we are refining our MS sales guidance to a range of $11.6 billion to $11.8 billion. We continue to expect MS will have an operating margin rate of approximately 13%. Turning to Technology Services, sales declined 12% in the quarter and 9% year-to-date. Declines in both periods reflect our portfolio shaping, as well as the program headwinds we've previously discussed. JRDC, VITA and KC-10 essentially represent all of the sales decrease at TS for both the quarter and year-to-date. I would also note that year-to-date, our global logistics and modernization business continues to grow at a mid-single digit rate, due to ramp-ups on new programs like SEMA. Technology Services operating margin rate was 10.7% for the quarter and 10.1% year-to-date. Based on year-to-date results, we now expect Technology Services sales will range between $4.2 billion and $4.3 billion with an operating margin rate of approximately 10%. As we roll all that up, we continue to expect 2018 sales of approximately $30 billion. Based on strong year-to-date performance, we are increasing our guidance for segment operating margin rate to the mid 11% range. On the corporate front, unallocated corporate expense declined by $112 million. During the quarter, we settled cost claims and recognized a $223 million benefit. This was a non-cash benefit in the quarter that will add to cash flows over a number of years. This was partially offset by $97 million of merger-related items, including $89 million of amortization of purchased intangibles and $8 million of additional depreciation expense resulting from the step-up in acquired property, plant and equipment. As you can see in our earnings release, we are presenting merger-related expense as a separate line item included in our unallocated corporate expenses. We've also provided a slide that gives you a five-year estimate of amortization of purchased intangibles and depreciation step-ups. For 2018, we expect merger-related items to total $225 million, increase to $379 million in 2019 and decline annually thereafter. Moving to pension, after completing our third quarter demographic study, we are increasing our 2018 estimated cash pension cost to $1 billion, which results in a slight increase in our total net FAS/CAS pension adjustments. Looking ahead to 2019, our net plan asset returns as of September 30 were approximately breakeven, and based on interest rates on September 30, we would expect our 2019 discount rate to increase in the range of 50 basis points to 60 basis points. For your modeling purposes, we've updated our three-year pension estimates, assuming breakeven, net-plan asset returns for 2018 and a 50 basis point increase in our 2019 discount rate. The FAS sensitivities for plan asset returns and discount rate variances are consistent with prior assumptions and are also included in this quarter's slide deck. Interest expense increased $60 million in the quarter and $196 million year-to-date, and we now expect net interest expense of $500 million. Our 2018 effective tax rate should be in the mid-13% range. Our third quarter tax rate reflects the reduction in the statutory rate of $35 million benefit for our discretionary pension contribution and a $70 million benefit for additional research credits and manufacturing deductions for prior years. As Kathy noted, we now expect 2018 EPS will range between $18.75 and $19, reflecting our improved operational outlook, the cost claim settlement, our lower effective tax rate, and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 175 million shares. Regarding capital deployment, we redeemed $700 million of outstanding Orbital ATK debt on July 19. In addition to paying down debt and contributing to our pension plans, year-to-date we have returned $825 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Through September 30, we've repurchased approximately 700,000 shares at an average price of about $307 per share. Share repurchases remain an important component of our capital deployment strategy and at the end of our third quarter our remaining share repurchase authorization was $2.1 billion. We continue to expect healthy cash flow from the enterprise this year. And based on year-to-date operational results, we now expect free cash flow to range between $2.5 billion and $2.7 billion, after both capital spending of approximately $1.15 billion and our $250 million voluntary pension contribution. With that, I think we're ready for Q&A. Steve?
Stephen C. Movius - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thanks, Ken. In the interest of time, I would ask each participant to limit themselves to a single one-part question. Jamie, would you initiate the Q&A?
Operator: Your first question comes from the line of Myles Walton with UBS.
Myles Alexander Walton - UBS: Hey. Good afternoon.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hey, Myles.
Myles Alexander Walton - UBS: I was wondering on Innovation Systems, I mean, that's pretty stellar growth out of the gates. And I'm just kind of curious. I'm not one to usually believe in revenue synergy, but are you hitting revenue synergies in, kind of, year one? And what is the underlying growth rate you expect over the medium term for this business?
Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.: So, Myles, thanks so much for recognizing the solid performance that our IS team delivered in this quarter. We, too, are very pleased with what they have delivered. I'll tell you, we are on track for the cost synergies that we defined for 2020, and we are making good progress on revenue and operational synergies. Those are being worked. Those will become much more material in the next few years. A lot of the good performance that we're seeing right now is a result of just continued strong growth in the markets that IS serves. We do anticipate that the revenue synergy, as I said, becomes evident in 2019 and much more material in 2020 and beyond.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Melius Research.
Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC: Hey. Good morning, and congrats, Wes. It's the end of an era. Congrats on the performance. It's been amazing.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Well, thank you.
Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC: I just – I can't help but ask, given some of the other calls, I mean, you chose to no-bid two pieces of work that have now led to a bit of noise around bidding strategies and potential losses and whatnot. And I just wondered if you'd share your perspective on whether you think this could potentially change bidding behavior, not necessarily for you, but around the industry, and are we beginning to see differences in cost structures or product positioning with respect to KPPs or return hurdles? Any perspective you could share on those, I'd appreciate it.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Yeah, Carter. No, I appreciate the question. And I would just – I'd offer two perspectives: one through sort of the lens of industry, and the other through the lens of the customer. On the industry side, clearly, every company has to make its own decisions about how it will approach the economics of any particular deal. And they have to look at it both in terms of the deal itself and in terms of its broader base of business and how all those things factor together. I like the process we've been using for a number of years. We have a very clear-eyed view of what the economics are likely to be. We spent a lot of time thinking about true net present value and, obviously, when you dig a big hole early, it's hard to get to good NPV. But again, I would not presume to know the economics of other companies and be in a position to comment on how individual decisions get made. And I would suggest that as we go forward, clearly, any company will have some finite appetite for how much of investment it can make in various areas. And those appetites change a little bit from time to time, but at the end of the day, we are generally a pretty well-managed industry. When I look across the landscape, there are really smart folks running the companies in our industry and, at the end of the day, they're going to have to make decisions that look at sort of their total picture, not just the individual project pictures. And they're going to have to figure out how much appetite there is for different elements of those types of decisions. On the customer side, the customer has to understand all of this as well. We've gone through an era where this idea of low-price technically acceptable was kind of a mind-set as we were navigating through an era where we were mostly concerned about the capacity of our force structure to deal with all of the different things we've been dealing with around the globe. For those of you that have taken a careful look at the national defense strategy that we're operating under now, which I think is – it's high time that we have this framework for our national defense strategy. There is a recognition that we've got to put as much, and probably more, focus on real capability, that our adversaries have taken full advantage of the focus that we've had elsewhere to not only catch up with us, but in some areas surpass us in some core capabilities, and we've got to be investing in that direction. When we're talking about capability and investing for capability, low-price technically acceptable is the wrong answer. And from an acquisition standpoint, our customers, I think, are beginning to shift in their thinking and understand that they're going to need to use some different strategies when we're really talking about very high-end capabilities and the way programs are going to need to work to assure them that they're going to ultimately get what they need. So, the pendulum swings back and forth on these things over time. I think it's important not to get too locked into one way of thinking about, which way things are going to go. But I do think that we are seeing a trend as I said more towards the high-end technology capabilities that are going to be needed, and that will influence acquisition behaviors and hopefully as we, industry and the customer community navigate that together, we'll stay on a track that enables the industry to be well managed.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Jon Raviv with Citi.
Jon Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hey. Good morning and congratulations, again, to Wes. Or sorry, good afternoon, I should say at this point. Sort of following on that question, just some broader perspectives on investing in this growth environment. For example, CapEx, we've been waiting for a few years for CapEx to peak. Any visibility as to when that might come down again? And sort of related is, as you make these investments, what's the sort of sales growth visibility associated with that? Essentially how long is the runway for sales growth now that we have the FY 2019 budget in place?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thanks, Jon. Appreciate the question. Maybe I'll lead off, hit the CapEx and then turn it over to Kathy for a little more color on where she sees that as well as the sales growth opportunities. In terms of CapEx, we have been investing to drive the growth that we are seeing and the existing program portfolio and the growth opportunities in front of us. I would say that we continue to expect that CapEx will stay at increased level in 2019 and then we should start to see it moderate as we look forward after that in both dollars and in a percentage of sales for sure as we continue to drive growth in the business. I would say that there could be a blip out beyond that if we are successful on some additional development programs. We've been clear that GBSD is one that, should we be successful in the down-select from 2 to 1, that, that is something that could drive some additional amount of capital, but I don't think it's particularly material compared to what we've seen here in the last few years as we've been driving for growth, again, in the portfolio as well as some of the newer programs. Kathy, did you want to add some color on that?
Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Just to follow on what Ken said, we certainly see investing in ourselves as our primary focus and we do have growth opportunities both near and longer term. We have been very pleased with what we saw in the 2019 budget for our programs as well as opportunities that we're pursuing. And you will continue to see us have growth in restricted and pursue a significant set of opportunities, including GBSD that if we are successful could lead to additional CapEx expenditure. But as Ken said, at the current moment we see that starting to top out next year.
Operator: Your next question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.
Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks very much. Good afternoon.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hi, Seth.
Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. I was wondering – this might be a bit of a sloppy calculation with the acquisition cost and stuff like that, but on a pro forma basis, it seems like maybe you're about three times net levered right now with close to $2 billion of cash to generate in the fourth quarter to take that down. So, how do you think about when you can really kind of get back into the market to buy back stock?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: I would say, Seth, that as we look at our leverage, we are quite comfortable with where we are from a leverage perspective. We were able to take advantage of our credit rating at the time of the acquisition to execute on the acquisition, the issuance of the debt, and to essentially see a single notch downgrade from a couple of the credit rating agencies and hold with one. As we have de-levered, both on some OA debt as well as a little bit of our debt, and we expect to de-lever another tranche that's due in 2019 for us. We see the ability to drive back to our traditional BBB+ credit rating. But to be clear on the second part of your question on the share repurchase, we were out of the market at the time of the acquisition. That was not related to a leverage issue that was related to the fact that we were in the process of the acquisition, we're in possession of material non-public information, and could not, therefore, enter into a plan to execute on share repurchase. We are pleased that the acquisition closed on June 8 – I'm sorry – June 6 and within a couple of days from there, we were able to get back into the market and we continue to be and expect to be in the market on share repurchase as we look forward. So quite satisfied with the leverage. I do expect as we grow the business, grow the cash, grow the EBITDA, we will continue to see that leverage number drop on us.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ronald Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yes. Good afternoon.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hey, Ron.
Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Maybe a question for both Kathy and Wes. Now that you have the OA assets within the Northrop family, how do we think about the opportunities in front of you in classified space, hypersonics, that kind of thing? Because it seems like, strategically, those assets put you in a better position to win some of that work than had you not had them?
Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.: So, Ron, this is Kathy. I'll start and then Wes can add in. You see it exactly the way we do. We see clear opportunity for us and jointly pursuing opportunities in space, hypersonics, precision munitions. These are areas where the portfolio in bringing together IS with the rest of Northrop Grumman, we clearly see synergy. And just as important, we see the opportunity to really shape where those markets go through innovation and increased affordability. The cost synergies that we'll generate in bringing the teams together will also contribute to our competitiveness. So, on all of those dimensions, we see that we are now able to offer more options in the markets I mentioned, as well as others, and that will be our primary sources of revenue synergy, which create the value over the long term from bringing the IS team into Northrop Grumman.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Yeah, and I would just completely agree with what Kathy said. I think this is turning out to be just a wonderful bringing together of two companies. The only thing I would add is I've just been delighted to see the very nice culture match and the almost instant desire on the part of all of the individuals involved in this, with respect to both of the companies that came together, to start getting together and creating new ideas, and new ideas are the source of value creation. That's how over the longer period of time, we're able to better serve the customer. And I think that's what the customer is expecting of us, quite frankly, as we bring the companies together. So, I'm really excited about that because we're already seeing those connections being made and those ideas beginning to be generated. So, I'm very optimistic about what this will mean.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley.
Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good afternoon. Kathy, Ken, just a question for you on the Aerospace margins side. You had some nice trends here in the quarter and I think year-to-date. I mean, does this create a runway to maybe getting back to the low-to-mid-teens as we look forward over the next couple of quarters and years?
Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.: So, Rajeev, I'll start, and then ask Ken to add in. But what I see is just really strong performance on the part of our AS team. The blocking and tackling that goes in to good solid program execution is what is leading to the margin improvement, and we clearly see that potential to continue. We incentivize the team clearly to continue to find opportunities for program performance improvement that leads to margin expansion. And so, what we are seeing is a clear result of that alignment of the team's objective to our shareholder objectives, and we expect it to continue. I'll let Ken speak a bit more on the details.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Yeah, I would say that we've seen mix as being the single largest impact on our margin profile at AS in terms of the lower margins over the last couple of years. To Kathy's point, I think we've seen that the sector is also performing on its portfolio programs both on the production and on the development side and is driving its performance up. I would just say that as we look forward, some of the larger development opportunities could be at the Aerospace sector. And if we are to take on some more mix challenge in terms of some additional development programs, then we could see some additional pressure on margin rates as we look forward. But with a significant growing top line that AS has had, we have seen nice growth in margin dollars even with some of the rate compression over the last couple of years. And, Rajeev, just to make sure we're all on the same page in terms of your question, you referenced sort of low teens. I would just say, if you look back historically, AS has tended to run in the 12s (38:36) and certainly our benchmark for AS is 11 (38:41) and we incentivize them to do better than that. So, just to kind of level set us all on where AS has been and make sure we're all on the same page there.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Peter Arment with Baird.
Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Thanks. Good afternoon. Wes, best of luck with everything.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thanks, Peter.
Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Kathy, can you maybe give us – you mentioned some consolidation at TS. Do you anticipate any portfolio shaping out of that or maybe just give us some updates how the timeline looks for when the actions will be completed? Thanks.
Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Yes. So, the new structure at TS is aimed at creating a better focused organization on innovation and affordability, and we are implementing that at the beginning of 2019. As many of you know, we've been on a journey over a couple of years to eliminate the majority of the commodity-based services work that we have in the TS portfolio. And next year, it'll continue to be somewhat of a tough compare as we had VITA in the portfolio through most of third quarter this year. But the logistics business at TS is growing. All segments of TS are winning new work, and those new programs are achieving strong margin rates. So, we really see that we now have a services business that has a solid foundation for growth in the long-term and healthy program performance. And so, that's really what we're working to optimize through this restructuring that we'll do at the beginning of January, and we'll go from three divisions down to two.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.
Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC: Hi. Good afternoon, and Wes, congratulations.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thanks, Sheila.
Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC: Kathy, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned a whole host of opportunities of program progress. I guess, how do you think about the longer-term growth profile of Northrop? And just outside of F-35 and restricted programs that have been a significant driver, maybe some opportunities you could point to or are significant areas of higher growth?
Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Yes. Thanks, Sheila. So, I made the comment about our growth prospects in the comparison to the investment accounts, which are what we typically think of as the proxy for our growth. And when I think about over the long-term, I'm talking multiple years. And so, many of the things that we're pursuing are awards in the 2020 timeframe. And to give you a few examples, as you asked, we have both for the OPIR programs, the GEO payload as well as the OPIR Polar satellite programs in our pipeline. We were full-force awarded the OPIR Polar, and I talked about the GEO payload program down-select that will be made in 2020. We also have a number of restricted space programs, and any one of them isn't as material as the collection of the handful that we are pursuing. We also have several full-rate production programs over the next two years. I talked about G/ATOR and CIRCM and IBCS all in my comments earlier. Those are all in Mission Systems, but all represent significant full-rate production awards in the next two years. We are competing for down-select in a number of areas. I talked about OmegA today. You all know we are competing for GBSD and have made it through the first down-select, and we also have been down-selected on Next-Gen Jammer low band. So all of those are competitions that we'll pursue over the next couple of years. And so, as you can see, it's across all of our businesses, Aero, Innovation Systems, Mission Systems and Technology Services that we have a robust pipeline as well as, as you noted, the growth that we have on current programs that are still ramping up to their full potential, like F-35.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.
Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: Thank you. This is an off-beat question, I suppose, here, but Wes, I'm kind of curious to know what's next for you? Where might we see you next? What are you passionate about? Are we going to hear from you again?
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Unlikely that I'll just disappear. But I have a number of things that – outside of our industry, that are of great interest to me, both on a personal level and, hopefully, in terms of being helpful to others. I'm going to take a little bit of time to sort all those things out, to figure out exactly where I want to focus my energies and my passion, but I'm looking forward to the opportunity to do that. And I very much appreciate the question, Hunter. It's been just a lot of fun to be involved in this for so long. But hopefully, I can find some other good things to do that will be helpful to others.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Stallard with Vertical Research.
Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Thanks so much. Good afternoon.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hey, Rob.
Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Good afternoon.
Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC: First of all, all the best for the future, Wes. I hope you have a good time.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thank you.
Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC: And then, secondly, Kathy, you mentioned the very strong year-to-date growth in export markets. I was wondering how sustainable do you think that growth rate is looking forward?
Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Rob, we see that growth rate as sustainable in that a number of the opportunities we are pursuing, including Global HALE, as well as the then sustainment for those products that we're delivering to continue strong pipeline there for other countries that are seeking that capability, as well as additional units. I spoke today specifically about, also, the E-2D growth that we're seeing in Japan and we anticipate that that kind of growth will also continue worldwide. And so, those are just a few examples that across all of our areas, Space, Cyber, Autonomous, Manned Aircraft, as well as the Sensors that go on those aircraft, we are still seeing strong growth potential in, particularly, Asia-Pacific, but also some notable programs in Europe.
Operator: Your next question comes from Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good afternoon.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hi, Sam.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about performance. You didn't – I guess, one is, can you give us an update on some of the programs from last quarter, say, the James Webb and the Advanced Capabilities program? And despite no, I guess, headline performance issues in the release, the unfavorable EACs did move up to $147 million in the quarter, which is up from the last quarter. Can you – are there any particular issues you can highlight that might have been behind that?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Sure, Sam. Let me maybe start with the second part of the question, and then Kathy can comment on the programs. I would say, from a negative EAC perspective, there's nothing there that I would point to. I would remind you that in the second quarter, some of the adjustments that we referenced were not recorded as negative EAC adjustments because they were with respect to options that had not been exercised and, therefore, some of those margin headwinds were not in that negative adjustment chart. And looking at the performance for the quarter, we're quite satisfied; all of the sectors performing well. We do have a large and diverse portfolio of programs that are always going to have some ups and some downs. And we try to take a solid approach to booking rates not exceedingly conservative, but not exceedingly optimistic, middle of the road. And that's going to mean you're going to have some ups and downs, particularly with a program that's as diverse and, quite frankly, complicated as ours. And so, no concerns. And on the programs themselves, I would just say nothing to comment on negatively from a performance perspective. And with that, I'll turn it over to Kathy.
Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Quite the contrary. We have good performance closing out the contract on VITA. And so, that process has gone exceedingly well. We also, on James Webb, have been executing according to the plan that we laid out earlier this year in conjunction with NASA, and the team is progressing through INT quite well. So, on both of those efforts, we have delivered just as we anticipated through the third quarter.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss with Barclays.
David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Good afternoon.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hi, David.
David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Ken, I think a question for you. Wanted to ask about how we should think about free-cash-flow conversion from here. It looks like this year you're going to be in the 70%, 75% range. All the different moving pieces going forward in terms of CapEx, working capital opportunity, pension, and all of that, how we should think about that trending from here? And then, a real quick one on pension. I get why the FAS side gets a little bit worse than what you were expecting previously, but it looks like you took 2020, the CAS number, higher. Can you just talk about what's going on there? And I think you've also said that you would expect CAS to actually go up kind of in the 2022 timeframe? Thanks.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Sure. Appreciate the question. From a free-cash-flow conversion perspective, I guess I would say that when you have some of these items like we had in this quarter with respect to the cost claim and we certainly had some tax items that are not necessarily going to result in cash tax savings in the year, they result in some future opportunities for cash, you can get some lumpiness in your cash conversion percentage. I think the important thing to focus on is the ability of this business to generate cash as we look forward. And this should be a business that generates a strong, both operating cash flow as we look forward as well as free cash flow. And largely, I would say, our free cash flow conversion should be increasing as we look forward. In particular, if you exclude some of the one-time items we've had this year as well as over the past couple years in terms of some either margin or tax benefits. And then, also as we look forward, we've mentioned that 2019 should be another year of, kind of, heavy – heavier capital expenditures, and that we should start to see that moderate, both in dollar terms and in percentage of sales terms, as we look forward. So that should help from a free cash flow conversion perspective. Additionally, going to your question on the CAS, I would say that CAS is certainly less sensitive to a number of assumptions than FAS is. But when we see, as we mentioned this year, we've got, call it, roughly break-even returns through September 30. That will result in some increased CAS as we look forward, and I think that's what you're seeing on the 2020 CAS line. And I would say that pension should continue to be something that is not necessarily a headwind for us from a cash or free cash flow perspective. We continue to see a profile where our CAS should be in excess of our required funding. So overall, this should be generating a fair amount of cash as we look forward. And I would say our conversion should be strong, although we always look to continue to drive operating excellence even when that means the cash might trail a little bit of time just managing all aspects of the business.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yes. Thank you very much. So Lockheed Martin increased their sales guide for this year and for next year, and they cited the fact that the FY 2018 budget got done early. We have an FY 2019 budget early. Congress threw some more money in the pot for the F-35 and the F-18 programs on which you also are a participant. As you look at next year, does your revenue growth look better today than it did three to four months ago?
Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.: So, Cai, I'll take that question. And I'll also remind you that we'll give you full guidance at the end of the fourth quarter call in 2019, in January 2019. But as we are approaching the end of this year and looking forward into 2019, I mentioned that our programs have been well-supported in the 2019 budget, and we do feel as if we will continue to see the kinds of growth that we have experienced in 2018 into 2019. And we will reduce some of the headwinds that we had particularly in Mission Systems with the two programs that Ken noted, and we will start to get through the headwinds that TS has seen through the three programs that we have noted throughout the call this year. So in terms of compares, we will be in a more favorable place as we head into 2019. But I will also state that the growth that we have seen historically going into 2017 to 2018 was very solid. So we continue to grow off of prior years of strong growth in the sectors as well. And, Ken, I don't know if there is anything that you'd like to add there.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: No, I think you hit it on the point there, Kathy. And it's right that we have seen – again, we have a diverse portfolio, and there's always going to be some ups and some downs, and we've seen some programs that have been working their way out of the system this year. Some of those will have a little bit of impact in the early part of next year but largely should work themselves out of, kind of, the compare from year-over-year in the earlier part of 2019. And I'm with you. I think we really feel like we have the ability to grow this business and feel very positive about how we're positioned. Now with that, Jamie, I think maybe we'll take just one last question.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein.
Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good afternoon.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hey, Doug.
Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hi, Doug.
Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: And, Wes, I'm sure you're going to find plenty of good things to do, but we will miss you here.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thank you, Doug. Thank you.
Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: I have a question about the Orbital acquisition. And as you set up the Innovation segment, where you've got three groups there, and when you look, over time, to really get synergies with Mission Systems and with Aerospace, one would think you've got to change that organization around or these organizations around significantly to optimize that. So, my question is how are you thinking about evolving these organizations, and in terms of the things you need to pull together to get the most value out of them? And what kind of timeframe are you looking at for that?
Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thanks, Doug. So, clearly, my primary focus over the course of 2019 is to make those evaluations, look at the portfolio. We are, as I said, developing our revenue synergy opportunities, and those will inform my thinking about how we need to ensure we operationalize and organize to execute on those synergy opportunities. But what I also value in bringing that team in as a standalone sector is the transparency that we will get as we work our way through 2019 around the cost synergies that we want to achieve full run rate of by 2020, as well as the opportunity to make sure we are implementing the best of both models that we have established. There is a lot for Northrop Grumman to take in terms of value from the way Innovation Systems operates. And likewise, the opposite is true. And so, we have had the best-of-both mentality, we're executing on a well-thought integration plan to help us achieve that, and so really I want to focus the better part of next year on realizing those cost synergies, executing on best of both, ensuring that they have solid operational performance, and then look through the revenue synergies to inform my thinking about any changes that we might make.
Stephen C. Movius - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thank you. At this point in time, I would like to turn the call over to Wes for some final comments.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: All right. Well, thanks, Steve. I asked Steve to save me a little time at the end of the call so that I can say a few words as I wrap up my last earnings call with the company. I want to take the opportunity to publicly say thank you to the amazing team of Northrop Grumman. It's a humbling experience to work with so many brilliant people, who are absolutely committed to serving our customers and advancing global security. I will tell you that this team rises to every challenge, and it is critical that we do as those we serve, our customers around the globe, are people we genuinely care deeply about. I'm grateful to have had the opportunity to work with such incredible people in our company and in our customer community. And it's been a real privilege to serve in so many roles in our company over the years and especially in the roles where I've had a chance to engage with the community of analysts and portfolio managers. I've sincerely enjoyed working with all of you in the financial community ever since I became CFO way back in 2005. The research that you perform, the questions you pose and the objectives you help frame really do make our companies better. I sincerely value what you do and how you do it, and I want to express my appreciation for the opportunity to work with all of you for so many years. So, while looking backwards is important to do periodically, I'm actually more excited about looking forward. Our company is fortunate to have an exceptional leader as our new CEO and I'm confident that the best years for Northrop Grumman are the years ahead of us. So, thanks for joining us on the call, and thanks for your continuing interest in our company.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for our participation.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's second quarter 2018 conference call. Today's call is being recorded. My name is Jamie, and I will be your operator today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Steve Movius, Treasurer and Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Movius, please proceed.
Stephen C. Movius - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thanks, Jamie. And welcome to Northrop Grumman's second quarter 2018 conference call. Before we start, please understand that matters discussed on today's call constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities Laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which are detailed in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties may cause actual company results to differ materially. Matters discussed on today's call may also include non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled in our earnings release. I would also remind everyone that our results reflect the adoption of new accounting standards for revenue recognition and pension accounting. Schedules 4 and 5 of our earnings release present comparable prior-period information, recast to reflect the adoption of these new standards. We have posted a presentation to our Investor Relations website that summarizes updates to our guidance and provides an update to the three years of pension information we provided with our initial 2018 guidance. On the call today are Wes Bush, our Chairman and CEO; Kathy Warden, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Ken Bedingfield, our CFO. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Wes.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thanks, Steve. Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I want to start the call by welcoming our new Innovation Systems team to Northrop Grumman. As you know, we completed the transaction with Orbital ATK on June 6, and we've established Innovation Systems as our fourth sector. As you can see from our second quarter results, Innovation Systems is already contributing. We expect this acquisition will be accretive on both a GAAP and a cash basis in 2018. It was another quarter of solid performance across our company, and I want to thank the entire team for their continued focus on execution. Second quarter sales grew 10%, reflecting continued double-digit growth at Aerospace Systems, largely driven by Manned Aircraft sales, higher Sensors and Processing volume at Mission Systems, and the addition of Innovation Systems. Our backlog increased to $52.2 billion, up $9.9 billion, which includes $8.7 billion of Innovation Systems backlog. Net earnings and diluted EPS each increased 24% in the quarter, driven by higher sales and higher segment operating income, as well as improvement in both pension and taxes. These positives more than offset transaction-related expenses. At the midpoint of the year, we're increasing our full-year 2018 earnings per share guidance to a range of $16.60 to $16.85. During the quarter, cash from operations totaled $875 million, an improvement of nearly $400 million over last year, primarily due to improved working capital performance. Year-to-date, cash from operations totaled $638 million, an improvement of nearly $600 million over prior-year results. Regarding capital deployment, the strategy is unchanged. Our first priority is investing for profitable growth, followed by managing the balance sheet, and returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Capital spending during the quarter reflects our continued investment in support of long-term profitable growth and affordability for our customers. We continue investing to expand our workforce, ramp up on large new programs, and pursue and win new business opportunities. In addition to the acquisition, we made capital investments of $199 million in the second quarter and more than $500 million year-to-date. We continue to expect capital expenditures of approximately $1.15 billion in 2018. We're updating our free cash flow projection to a range of $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion. In terms of the balance sheet, we're focused on near-term debt reduction as well as ensuring our pension plans remain well-funded, and we continue to return cash to our shareholders. In 2018, we've increased the dividend 20%. And I'm also happy to report that with the closing of the Orbital ATK transaction, we have resumed share repurchases. Overall, we're pleased with our team's accomplishments during the first half of the year. In terms of our market environment, we continue to see positive trends for defense spending with the U.S. and with our allies. There is clear recognition that we need to invest in both readiness and modernization. As I look at the opportunity set for our company, particularly with the addition of Innovation Systems, I feel very good about our alignment with our customers' current and emerging needs, and our ability to execute on our current portfolio of programs as well as capture important new opportunities going forward. We encourage Congress and the administration to continue making steady progress to reach a timely agreement on FY 2019 appropriations. A couple weeks ago, I announced that I'll be stepping down as CEO on January 1. I suspect some of you may be asking why now and wondering if there's some reason you should understand regarding my timing. So I want to be very transparent about my reasons with all of you, as I have been about the other decisions in our company over the years. It starts with a strongly held personal belief that healthy organizations use the dynamic of change to continuously improve themselves and to support a culture of excellence. Over the course of my tenure in my current role, we've made many changes in our portfolio, in our approach to taking on new business and how we drive performance and I believe, most importantly, in our culture. I feel these changes have been key to the value that we've created for all of our stakeholders. Healthy change requires new leadership perspectives from time-to-time, and this includes new perspectives at the CEO level. This is my ninth year as CEO and, as you should expect, getting succession right is very important to me. I'm proud that we have a disciplined and thoughtful approach to succession planning at all levels in our company. And with a long tenured CEO, good succession planning also means having the successor take on the role in a timely manner when they are ready to take the company to the next level. We are so fortunate to have a leader who is now ready to become our next CEO and to lead us forward. Many of you already know Kathy. So I don't have to tell you that she is an outstanding executive, but I will anyway. Kathy is absolutely the right person to take this on. She is a great leader. She has a wonderful depth and breadth of knowledge about our company and our industry, and her leadership approach is based on the core values of our company. As I've said in my message to our team announcing this transition, I have high expectations for what this company will accomplish during Kathy's tenure as our CEO. As a part of our transition process, Kathy, Ken, Steve and I will have several opportunities to meet with many of you over the coming months. Kathy and I will be very focused on ensuring we execute a seamless transition through the end of the year. And I've also committed to our board that I will remain as Chairman through July of 2019, about a year from now. So let me turn the call over to Kathy to give us an update on our company's operations in the second quarter. Kathy?
Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thanks, Wes, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I review operations and provide an update on Innovation Systems integration, I want to take this opportunity to thank the board of directors for electing me to succeed Wes as Northrop Grumman's next CEO. Since joining Northrop Grumman in 2008, Wes's mentorship and example have been invaluable to my growth as a leader. As I assumed increasingly larger P&L responsibilities within our company, I was fortunate to work with Wes. Our values, decision-making, and focus on performance are well aligned. So thank you, Wes. I look forward to working alongside of you for another year to ensure a smooth transition for all of our stakeholders. I am very excited about where Northrop Grumman is today and, more importantly, where our team can take the company going forward. Our value-creation opportunity is as robust as ever. Now let me touch on integration of Innovation Systems. With the close of the transaction, 15,000 new employees joined Northrop Grumman, and I want to welcome them to our company. We stood up Innovation Systems as our new fourth sector on June 7 with their existing operations management team in place. When we announced the transaction, we said that we expected to achieve $150 million of annual cost synergies by 2020, and we estimated it would cost about $75 million to achieve those synergies. We are on track to meet or exceed the cost synergy estimate. We expect to spend about $25 million this year to achieve cost synergies and $50 million in 2019. While IS has only been a part of Northrop Grumman for a few weeks, we're very excited about the opportunity our combination gives us to broaden our capabilities and offerings and provide innovative solutions to meet our customers' emerging requirements, while also creating value for shareholders and providing expanded opportunities for our combined workforce. This is a combination that is compelling financially and strategically, and truly strengthens our foundation for long-term profitable growth. Turning to our sector highlights for the quarter, each of our sectors captured business and achieved program milestones that position us well for the long-term. At Aerospace Systems, in Manned Aircraft, we continue to ramp up on restricted activities and the F-35. Sales increased by more than 40% on the F-35 program. And during the quarter, we achieved a 1.5-day production interval, or said another way, we're now producing one center fuselage unit every day-and-a-half. We delivered 32 center fuselages during the quarter, compared to 20 last quarter and 18 in the second quarter of 2017. We've completed delivery of all 94 units under LRIP 10, we've delivered 31 under LRIP 11, and we delivered our first unit under LRIP 12. We expect to deliver 116 F-35 center fuselages in 2018. I would also note that we reached an agreement with Lockheed Martin on LRIP 11 that supports continued affordability for the customer and incentivizes continued strong performance for our teams. In Autonomous Systems, the Prime Minister of Australia formally announced the initiation of the Australian Triton acquisition and the successful passage through their Gate 2 milestone. The initial authorization is for one air vehicle, with infrastructure to support the full fleet of six air vehicles. And in Space, the Air Force awarded Northrop Grumman a sole source contract for the initial phase of the Polar System for our nation's next-generation Overhead Persistent Infrared program. Next-gen OPIR will provide improved missile warning capabilities that are more survivable against emerging threats than the current generation SBIR system. We also plan to compete for the payload portions of the OPIR programs. Most of you are aware that NASA, based on an Independent Review Board recommendation, announced a new 2021 launch date for the James Webb Space Telescope. The IRB also reaffirmed the mission value of the world's premier science observatory. All the telescope's major elements are now at our Redondo Beach facility, where we have begun final integration and testing of this space telescope that will explore the origins of the universe and search for life beyond our solar system. In the second quarter, the spacecraft bus underwent a successful mechanical shock test, and the JWS team also separately powered up the two halves of the telescope, the Optical Telescope Element Integrated Science Instrument Module, or OTIS, and the spacecraft bus. These are critical steps in this phase of the program. Now turning to Innovation Systems. They launched an Antares rocket carrying a company-built Cygnus spacecraft to the International Space Station. Cygnus subsequently rendezvoused and berthed with the station to deliver 7,400 pounds of vital supplies and scientific experiments to support the on-board astronaut crew. Cygnus departed the Space Station on July 15 and it will conclude its mission on July 30. IS also conducted a successful motor case first test, an important milestone in the development of our new OmegA large-class space launch vehicle. And finally, we shipped the company-built ICESat-2 Earth science spacecraft to its launch site at Vandenberg Air Force Base. The satellite was designed, built, and tested at our manufacturing facility in Arizona and is scheduled to be launched this September. At Mission Systems, we continue to ramp up on the F-35 and SABR radar programs in the Sensors and Processing business area. The F-35 program plans to deliver 140 radars this year versus 90 in 2017. Our SABR team has secured its fifth production customer and now has orders for more than 400 systems, of which 56 have been delivered through the end of the second quarter. The F-16 Air National Guard upgrade program is progressing on schedule, with flight testing for Phase 1 to be complete this year and initial production deliveries to begin March of 2019. Our teaming agreement with Lockheed Martin positions us to support additional new F-16 buys and capability upgrades of existing F-16 fleets worldwide, highlighting SABR's superb capability, reliability, interoperability and long-term affordability. During the quarter, MS won an Air Force competition to sustain and modify critical-mission warning radars. The $866 million seven-year single-award IDIQ SMORS contract calls for sustainment and modification of our nation's worldwide network of ground-based radars. Our work on SMORS will uphold and enhance the Air Force's ability to detect missile attacks early, while also providing forces with critical situational awareness of objects in space. Through SMORS, Northrop Grumman will ensure the high availability of ground-based radar systems for Air Force Space Command. At Technology Services, the State Department awarded us a 10-year $850 million contract for its Consular Systems Modernization program. Our team will support the digital transformation of the systems supporting passport and visa application, and other Department of State Consular Affairs services. This is an important win for TS, and it reflects our strategy to build a TS portfolio focused on higher-end value-enhanced activities. We've taken numerous steps to position TS for profitable growth over the long-term, and we continue that process as we work with the Commonwealth of Virginia to support the transition of VITA to new service providers. We are addressing numerous new opportunities in the U.S. and with our allies around the globe. And we are excited about the long-term growth prospects enabled by our portfolio, including the revenue synergy opportunities offered by the addition of Innovation Systems. So, now, I'll turn the call over to Ken for a more detailed discussion of our financials.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thanks, Kathy, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll add my thanks to our team for their efforts through the first half of the year. Today I'll briefly review our second quarter results and update our 2018 guidance. As you're all aware, in June, we updated our guidance for the addition of Innovation Systems but did not provide sector-level detail. I'll provide both company- and sector-level updated guidance today. Regarding the quarter, I'd note that we had strong awards, solid sales and earnings growth, including a partial month of IS results, offset somewhat by deal costs and a full quarter of net interest expense on the debt associated with the acquisition. Turning to sector results. Aerospace Systems had another quarter of double-digit sales growth. Sales for both the second quarter and year-to-date were up 11%. Higher volume in Manned Aircraft was the major growth driver for both periods, with restricted activities and the F-35 ramp-up accounting for most of the higher volume. Autonomous Systems and Space were also higher for both periods. Growth in Autonomous Systems reflects higher volume across a number of programs, and higher Space sales reflects growth in restricted activities and the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent program, partially offset by lower volume in unrestricted space. Operating income for Aerospace Systems is also up for both the quarter and year-to-date, with operating margin rates up 10.7% and 10.5% respectively. While AS margin rates continue to reflect a higher level of early-phase development work, the second quarter rate of 10.7% matches last year's second quarter margin rate and includes positive performance adjustments of $69 million from multiple restricted programs. These positives more than offset a negative adjustment on the James Webb Space Telescope program. Based on results of the first half, we are increasing our sales guidance for AS to approximately $13 billion. We now expect AS will have an operating margin rate of approximately 10.5%. Turning to Innovation Systems. For the period since close, sales totaled $400 million with a margin rate of 9.8%. For the 2018 post-acquisition period, we expect IS will have revenue of approximately $3 billion with a mid-10% operating margin rate. Turning to Mission Systems. Sales rose 1% in the quarter and 2% year-to-date. Sensors and Processing is the principal driver, with double-digit growth year-to-date due to higher volume for restricted, F-35, SABR and communications programs. Advanced Capabilities is also higher in both periods due to higher volume for several programs, including IBCS, partially offset by lower volume for JRDC and follow-on activity. Cyber and ISR volume declined in both periods due to program completions in the restricted ISR area. Mission Systems operating income decreased 8% and 3% respectively for the second quarter and year-to-date. Operating margin rate for the quarter was 12.2% and includes a forward loss provision on a program in Advanced Capabilities. In addition, last year's second quarter results included a Cost Claim benefit. Year-to-date, MS segment operating margin rate is 12.6%. For 2018, we continue to expect sales in the mid-to-high $11 billion range with an operating margin rate of approximately 13%. No change to prior guidance. Turning to Technology Services. Sales declined 10% and 7% respectively for the second quarter and year-to-date. Declines in both periods reflect our portfolios shaping as well as the program headwinds we've previously discussed. Declines in programs like VITA, KC-10 and JRDC are being partially offset by ramp-ups on new programs like SEMA as well as international activity. Technology Services operating margin rate was 9.1% for the quarter and 9.9% year-to-date. Second quarter operating income includes a negative adjustment on the VITA program. We received a notice of termination from the Commonwealth, which reduced the program's expected period of performance with the resulting impact on earnings. I would also note that last year's second quarter included a benefit for the Cost Claim. Based on year-to-date results, we now expect Technology Services sales will be in the low-to-mid $4 billion range with an operating margin rate of approximately 10%. As we roll all that up, we continue to expect sales of approximately $30 billion and a segment operating margin rate in the low-to-mid 11% range. We also continue to expect a high-11% total operating margin rate, reflecting $425 million for unallocated corporate expense, which includes a preliminary estimate of $175 million for amortization of purchased intangibles for the acquisition of Innovation Systems as well as approximately $55 million in full-year deal costs. Moving to pension, no change to prior guidance for total net FAS/CAS pension adjustment of $1.08 billion and no change to net interest expense of $520 million. Further, we now expect our effective tax rate will be in the mid-16% range. As Wes noted, we are increasing our 2018 EPS guidance to a range of $16.60 to $16.85, which assumes no change to our weighted average diluted share count. Regarding capital deployment, debt reduction is one of our near-term priorities. And during the quarter, we retired $850 million of Northrop Grumman notes, we redeemed $700 million of outstanding Orbital ATK debt on July 19, and we have another $500 million of Northrop Grumman notes we expect to retire in 2019. In the second quarter, we initiated a commercial paper program to enhance short-term liquidity as we deploy capital for value creation. Cash generation in the second quarter and year-to-date was much stronger than last year due to improved trade working capital performance. We continue to expect healthy cash flow from the enterprise this year, and we have raised the bottom end of our free cash flow guidance range by $100 million. We now expect free cash flow of $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion after capital spending of approximately $1.15 billion and a planned $250 million discretionary pension contribution. We look forward to continued strong performance from our team in the second half of the year. With that, I think we're ready for Q&A. Steve?
Stephen C. Movius - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thanks, Ken. Our formal remarks ran a little bit long today. So we're going to extend the Q&A session a bit past 1 o'clock. With that, I would ask each participant to limit themselves to a single question, so we can get through the queue. And with that, Jamie, would you open up the line for Q&A?
Operator: Your first question comes from the line of Ronald Epstein with Bank of America.
Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey. Good morning – actually, good afternoon, guys.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hey, Ron.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hey, Ron.
Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: On the new segment there, the Innovation Systems business, clearly I mean there's a play there on GBSD. But how do we think about the broader business implications? There's been a lot of discussion lately about hypersonics. What does it bring to Northrop Grumman in terms of hypersonics? And then there's been a lot of discussion on classified space. So how does that segment, the acquisition, strengthen Northrop Grumman in those businesses?
Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thanks, Ron. I will take that question. We are very excited about the portfolio of Innovation Systems because of a number of the areas you noted. Certainly, for GBSD, they will be a key partner for us on that program, as they also continue to partner with Boeing. But we also look beyond GBSD. And some of the areas you mentioned, hypersonics, this expands Northrop's portfolio, which has traditionally been more in the counter-hypersonics part of the market, to now also be able to add value in the weapon systems themselves. We also look at classified space, and we have traditionally worked with large, complex systems. This expands our portfolio to smaller systems and allows us to have a much more expanded offering to the national security space community. So, across the broad spectrum of things that Northrop Grumman has traditionally done, Orbital and ATK coming together expanded their portfolio, and now as part of Northrop Grumman, significantly expands our portfolio of offerings to our customers across a wide variety of the community.
Operator: Your next question is from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley.
Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks for the time. I guess, Wes and Kathy, congrats on your new role. Kathy, just more of an obvious question for you. As you go through the transition, what are your key priorities going to be for Northrop? Maybe what'll change versus what we've been seeing over the last few years?
Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Well, thanks for that question. Wes will be in place as CEO through the remainder of the year, and in exercising a smooth transition, I'll continue to focus on the successful integration of Orbital ATK, standing that team up as our new fourth sector. We also are working the capture of significant opportunities, both domestically and internationally, and we're focused on solid-segment operating performance as we ramp up on critical development and production program. But as I look to the future, there are a number of areas that I believe have served us well. First, our performance-driven culture, also our approach to capital deployment, and the way we have aligned our team's incentives to drive performance for all of our stakeholders. So these are areas I certainly look to continue. I'm also confident we have a portfolio that's well-aligned to our customers' needs for today and well into the future, but of course, I'm going to continue to assess the portfolio, the structure, our strategies of the organization to make sure that we do incorporate change to enhance value for our customers, our shareholders and our employees.
Operator: Your next question is from Peter Arment with Baird.
Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Good afternoon. Congrats, Kathy and Wes. Hey, just Kathy, on the Innovation Systems particularly, this has got a higher percentage of fixed-price contract mix. It's also got a higher percentage mix of international customers. And just thinking about just the long-term margin profile of this segment, can this rival Mission Systems, excluding some of the amortization costs from the deal? Thanks.
Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thanks, Peter. When we look at targets for our segments, we're looking at Innovation Systems in that 10% to 11% range. It has the features you noted, with strong fixed-price component as well as international that tend to drive margins up. So it's a very broad portfolio of capability as well and they have tended to focus on very innovative capabilities. So, when we set benchmark, that would be the 10% to 11% that I talked about. Taking their portfolio, looking at other companies' similar portfolios, that's the range that we would see them in. And we, of course, will drive to achieve better in that benchmark performance.
Operator: Your next question is from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.
Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. And congratulations, Kathy and Wes. Ken, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about Technology Services. The segment was generating about $130 million or so of EBIT on a quarterly basis fairly consistently. We had the step-down in this quarter. The guidance implies it's going to step-up again a little bit in the back half. But as some of the contracts wind down here, how do we think about where this business bottoms out and where you could start growing again in Technology Services?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Sure, Seth. Thanks for the question. I'll start, and Kathy may have some color she wants to add as well. So I think a little bit of a multi-part question on both the margin as well as the sales profile. And from a margin perspective, we've seen that TS has been one of the strongest, if not the industry-leading, margin performer in its segment. And I would say that we saw a little bit of a challenge this quarter in terms of dealing with the early termination impact of the VITA program, which had some impact on margin. We are holding the full-year margin rate estimate that we started out the year with, which does indicate that we have the ability to perform in the second half of the year to get to our 10% approximate margin rate for TS. And we feel pretty good about the team's ability to do that. From a sales perspective, I would say that we're seeing the continued impact of those headwinds, KC-10, JRDC. TS did a lot of the work on an inter-company basis for MS on the JRDC program, as well as now the headwind from VITA as that is expected to terminate earlier than we had previously considered. That being said, they have had some wins in the sector. We've talked previously about contract messaging as well as the SEMA program, and now starting to see some of the international starting to take off. So I wouldn't want to necessarily declare when that growth will start to come again, but we certainly look that as we get some of these headwinds through the system, TS should have the ability to grow its business in line with the market as we look forward over the longer-term.
Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.: And I'll just add that we've been on the journey of reshaping the TS portfolio for a couple of years. We are seeing VITA with the completion as our last large IT outsourcing contract. And so as we look forward to the areas where we've been growing the portfolio, like that modernization of both our own platforms and the platforms of others, as well as some of the higher value activities that I mentioned with the win with the Department of State this quarter, we really are at a place where the growth is now coming from areas that we feel TS is both very competitive and adds significant value to our customers' needs. So we are encouraged about what this team is going to be able to accomplish in these areas of focus.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Richard Safran with Buckingham Research.
Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Wes, Kathy, Ken, and Steve, good afternoon. Wes, just want to say best of everything. For whatever it's worth, I think you did an absolutely terrific job. Kathy, I wish you all the best. And I have a...
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thank you.
Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thank you.
Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Well, you're welcome. I have a question on Mission Systems. Ken, I want to know if you can talk a bit more about what was happening there. What was the reason that costs rose so much on the Advanced Capability program that you took a forward loss on? And could you quantify the amount of what the forward loss was? Just trying to get the margin impact. Now, I may have missed this in your opening remarks, but was the reason that cyber and ISR volumes were down in the quarter just reflects some timing? Or was this all just cyber and ISR programs just winding down? Thanks.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Sure. Let me take maybe the second part of the question first, Rich. And we have a business area that we refer to as cyber and ISR. But largely the impact that we're seeing is in the restricted ISR area of that business. And so we're really seeing that there were some program completions, as expected, I would say, that have created a little bit of a headwind on the sales side. But we are seeing that Sensors and Processing is certainly more than offsetting that as those programs are working their way through the life cycle. And as we look forward for MS over the long-term, we should see a nice and robust growth profile. With respect to your question on the Advanced Capabilities program, I would say that clearly the amount of the forward loss was not material, otherwise we would have disclosed it in the 10-Q as we did the amount of the pickup on the multiple restricted programs at Aerospace. So not going to put a number on it today, but certainly had an impact on the trend from a margin rate perspective, which is why we noted it in the document, both the 10-Q and the ER. But certainly not of a materiality level that we saw on the other. From your question on what drove the loss, I would say we have seen some technical challenges that we are working our way through. Those challenges are on a cost-type program, but we are seeing that it's had some impact on a fixed-price option that we have related to that program. And this is driving a bit of a cost growth on that fixed-price option, which we think is likely to be exercised by the customer, and therefore we have recorded that as a forward loss. Kathy, I don't know if you want to add any...
Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.: I'll just note that we've maintained our guide for Mission Systems as we look at the headwinds on the top line, about $225 million for two programs that, as Ken said, completed. We see great growth in Sensors and Processing. I talked about some of that earlier in the call. And the fixed-price mix is up in Mission Systems in these areas where we are growing in production. So I'm confident that, as we look forward, both top line and operating margin will continue to be healthy in Mission Systems.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.
Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC: Good morning, and congratulations, everyone.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thank you.
Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC: I was wondering if you could maybe talk about the moving pieces within working capital and, now with the inclusion of OA, how we should think about those and maybe the opportunities?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Sure, Sheila. I appreciate that. And I would say that we've seen some improvement in working capital this year, and we are happy to see that starting to turn to the positive for us. We have been building working capital for a couple of years, as we saw some long-term production programs that had some liquidations that were tied to deliveries. Those deliveries are starting to occur. We're also very focused on thinking about how we get the right cash terms for the type of contracts that we are taking on. We had seen the change in the DFARS have an impact on that looking back a couple of years as well. So I would say some favorable working capital performance for us. From an Innovation Systems perspective, I would say that there are some programs in the backlog that have had some higher unbilled balances. CRS is one that comes to mind. There are some significant milestone events that will drive some payments. The A350 program is one that also had some cash headwinds reflected with it, and we expect that that is starting to turn here as we look forward. So we're excited about working capital performance so far year-to-date. Obviously, a lot of work to do in the second half of the year, but we're working hard on it, on the entire portfolio including Innovation Systems. And we look forward to strong cash generation for the second half of the year as well as, as we look out into the future, this is a business that should be growing, managing working capital and generating strong cash.
Operator: Your next question is from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey. Good afternoon, everybody. Kathy, congrats on the appointment. Wes, congrats on the retirement and a fantastic career.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thank you, Noah.
Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thank you.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Ken, I wanted to try to dig into the margins a little bit. And I know you just kind of passed on the quantification of the item in MS, but I'm getting a lot of questions from your stakeholders on the size of the reach forward at MS and the VITA and at TS. Not sure if – I guess maybe I'm just asking again if you'd quantify those or maybe if you could give us the factual threshold where you have to disclose something like that so we can make an estimate, just because it did impact the margins. And then, looking forward, I guess I'm wondering are you at the low watermark for both contract-type mix and risk retirement potential? Because cost plus as a percentage has been moving higher and EACs as a percentage have been moving lower, both reasonably significantly. I wonder how those trend from here.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: All right. So, on the first part of the question, I guess what I would say is, again, don't want to put a number on the individual items that we disclosed in order to give a sense of what's going on in the business and understand the trends. I would say, clearly, we think about materiality and, in reality, significance really as a matter of judgment and not any magic number that we put on it. We certainly did disclose the items on the restricted programs in Aerospace Systems, which was $69 million. So I guess that puts a number on the upper-bound for you. And with respect to those items, look, they're largely behind us. We feel pretty good about the fact that we've got the issues related to those programs addressed and had an impact on the quarter. We disclosed it, wanted to make sure you understood what it was. But not a material or even significant impact for putting a number on there. And as we think about it, we held guidance on margin rate for both MS and TS, which should indicate that they've got the ability to perform in the second half to more than cover some of those issues that we experienced in the second quarter. So, from a contract-type mix and risk retirement perspective, I think my view on that, Noah, would be that I don't necessarily think that we have sort of run out of runway on that perspective. I think we have been working hard to try to make sure that we reflect our best estimate of operating earnings as early as possible in the life cycle of a program and making sure that we are taking those increases along the life, and historically, there may have been a little more waiting until a little bit later in the life of the program, but we try to make sure we're always reflecting our best estimates. And so we've seen that our, what I'll call, core margin rate has come up a bit in the last couple of years, and I think that's really what's driving the lower amount of risk retirements is just moving more of the earnings into the core earnings rate, or baseline rate maybe I should call it, than into the earnings adjustments themselves. I would also note a little bit of a quirk this quarter. The forward loss on the fixed-price option at MS is technically not an earnings adjustment because the option hasn't yet been exercised. So the forward loss is reflected in the margin rates, but it's not in the schedule above. So, that can have some impact in the analysis as well. But the bottom line is this business can generate strong margins. I don't see any change in its ability to drive margins. We haven't changed our benchmark, strong performance by AS in the first half of the year and strong expected performance for all the sectors for the full year of 2018.
Operator: Your next question comes from Carter Copeland with Melius Research.
Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC: Hey. Good morning, all, and congrats on the transitions.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thank you.
Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thank you.
Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC: Wes, if you want to take up golf more seriously, give me a call and I could use an excuse to get out of the office.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thanks, Carter.
Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC: Look, at the risk of being overly blunt, I just want to probe a little bit on this whole program performance thing, since clearly the stock is down a lot today and I think that's why. And I guess I'll just go back to what I asked last quarter. The headlines on James Webb point to, I guess, sort of performance that I would characterize as maybe atypical from what Northrop has done over the last decade or so. And I get it that a lot of the technology is first-of-a-kind. But Northrop Grumman's a company where lots of things are being done for the first time with bombers or satellites or autonomous aircraft. And so this quarter you guys gave the first forward loss I think in a decade and, of course, the negative adjustments you talked about. And it sounds like from the commentary, if we put VITA aside since it seems more like a simple termination, it sounds like technical risk identification is the similarity between those two downers that you had. And I want to kind of go back to the same question from last quarter. Are these challenges isolated? Or do they reveal anything that changes how you think about risk identification, where it's appropriate to set booking rates? As a detailed program performance person, what's the postmortem that you take away from the analysis of those things since they have been somewhat atypical over such a long time at Northrop?
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Yeah. Carter, it's Wes. Let me reflect on that since I've probably got the most historical perspective on it than to bring you current. And I'll just take each of them as you described them. But we'll start with kind of a broader view. I really like what we've done in our company. And as I said in my opening remarks, this goes to sort of the core of our culture and the enterprise to figure out how to quantify risk, how to manage risk, and to execute our programs better. If you turn the clock back quite a few number of years ago, we were really struggling on that. And as you know, years ago, we instituted a very robust set of changes, and we've maintained those changes. In fact, it's become just core to how we operate. Does that mean we're perfect? No, we're not perfect. Clearly, if we're going to continue to help our customer community press the edge, there will be some things that we don't get exactly right, but they need to be very few and far between. And we have two, as you mentioned, and I think it is appropriate to set aside VITA. We've been very clear for a long time about our intent to exit that business and do it in a way that created a smooth transition for the Commonwealth. We were committed to supporting them through that process. And I would say on a very positive note with respect to that one, that transition was enabled a little bit faster than originally conceived. So I view that as very, very supportive of our portfolio action. But let me take the two that you had mentioned. So, first on James Webb. On James Webb, this is a program that we took on quite a number of years ago, a decade-and-a-half ago actually, with the intent knowledge at the time that there was going to be a lot of invention on the program. We have succeeded in that invention. It is a remarkable engineering accomplishment – scientific and engineering accomplishment to have gotten ourselves through that invention. And now we're down to the phase of actually integrating the final parts together. And inevitably, and this is how we do these types of programs and why we do what we do, we're going to test the heck out of this thing because we only get one shot at it to launch it. And we're going to make sure we find every little thing. Unfortunately, when you're at the very end stage of a program, finding a little thing propagates to the big thing. And that's what we're experiencing. And we and NASA – and I have to give NASA a lot of credit for the intensity of focus and their stick-to-it-ness with a flagship program like this. But we're working our way through it, and I am absolutely confident that we are going to launch something that our nation is going to be so incredibly proud that we did, we together. So that, while it's tough, we're sticking it out, and we're going to make sure we find out whatever the things are to be found as we go through the testing, and we're not going to launch it until it's right. That's what we do, and we're intent on making sure that it comes out right. With respect to the forward loss item, I think it's been covered rather extensively here. And I'll just say, broadly, this was a case where the technical requirements were, again, similar to what we do in other areas, quite extensive. And with respect to our risk management, I think we found a flaw in our process with respect to this particular class of technology and the way we looked at production. And so you might imagine we're treating that as an investment that we're going to run through the rest of the company and make sure we don't ever have that one pop up again, just as we've done with other issues that we have found over time. And I'm confident we'll get it right on this program as well and be in a place where the customer is going to be just delighted with the capability that comes through it. But we signed up to something, once again we're going to make sure that we follow through on our commitments as we always do, and that's the reason we went ahead and recognized this on a go-forward basis. But to your question about is there something endemic or are these more isolated, I see them as isolated cases. There are clearly learnings from each. And as I said, we're not perfect but we sure are striving for perfection here at Northrop and that's the way I would characterize what I'm seeing with these two issues. I feel very good about program execution across the enterprise. And I'll just add that as we've brought Innovation Systems on and we've taken a good hard look at how they're performing and the way they're going about their business, I see that discipline of program execution at Innovation Systems as well. So it's going to be another very strong culture match of a kind as we bring the two businesses together, and I'm excited about that. But I very much appreciate the question, Carter. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jon Raviv with Citi.
Jon Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. Good afternoon. And congratulations to Kathy and Wes.
Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thanks, Jon.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thank you.
Jon Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: At the risk of oversimplification, guys, the number of segments that Northrop has had over the years has shifted around a little bit and you recently had a nice consolidation of the three. Now we're at four. Obviously, Orbital just sitting in IS, maybe there's some opportunities there. So, just now that the deal is closed, what are some of your perspectives on organization and portfolio at this point? Where do you see the opportunity to pull some levers in that organization and to what effect do you usually make those sorts of decision?
Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thanks for the question, Jon. As we have brought on the team and stood up Innovation Systems, we're taking this opportunity to really understand the portfolio through revenue synergy to identify where else in the company we can work together to realize that synergy. And we're already off to a strong start. We've talked about some of the areas already, like Space, particularly National Security Space and the recapitalization that we see going on there, and the great work that our teams are already doing to begin working together. We've also talked about missile defense, and even as we look forward into smart munitions, that's another area of synergy opportunity. So it will be a process over the next period of time to really assess where that alignment should be in the future. We believe that in the near-term, it's best to keep that team organized together. They had recently gone through the integration of Orbital Sciences and ATK, and done a lot of good work in realizing their own synergies in coming together as a team. And we want to have a smooth transition for that team so as to take advantage of the growth that they already were experiencing, which was quite rapid if you look back at their first quarter performance year-over-year, they experienced significant growth. We want to ensure that they are able to continue to stay focused on both that growth attainment as well as their program performance, and that anything we do to change the organization structurally is done very thoughtfully.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.
Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: Hi, everybody. Thank you.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hi, Hunter.
Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: Wes, congratulations, by the way, both you guys.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thanks.
Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: Sure. The positive performance adjustments on restricted programs at Aerospace, is that related to B-21 as much as you can say? And how do you think about progress on that program, given the upcoming CDR that the Air Force itself has publicly talked about? Thank you.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hunter, I would say that there's not a lot – actually, there's nothing that we're going to be able to say beyond what's in the documents. The positive earnings adjustments at Aerospace were related to multiple restricted programs. And with respect to program performance and progress on the B-21, I would simply just refer you to comments made by the Air Force as probably the best place for you to get information on that.
Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: All right. Thank you.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hunter, I'll just add, we're really proud of our team. They're doing a great job for us.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Research.
Robert A. Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Thanks very much. Good afternoon.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hi, Rob.
Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hello.
Robert A. Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Wes, Kathy, a question for you, either collectively or individually. There's been obviously the news recently about peace breaking out in the Korean Peninsula, or potentially. And also we've had the NATO summit as well and various things going on there. I was wondering how this has translated through to what you're hearing from your customers. Have you seen any change in Asian demands as a result of what we've seen? Any clearer than any change in Europe?
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: So we actually see demand picking up in both arenas. You can look at very, very narrow focused events in one region or another and try and reach conclusions on it. But you really have to look at the big picture. And the big picture, if you just look at Asia Pacific for just a moment, the nations all see very, very – I would characterize it as high-risk potential on their horizon with the growth in some nations, both in their economic capacity but also their intentions in terms of their behaviors, causing many of the nations, many of our allies throughout that region to realize that they are going to need to continue to increase their investment in their own security. So that region in particular, I think as we think about the future, poses a significant both opportunity for us to be supportive of our allies but also a challenge for many of them to sort through how they're really going to achieve their security objectives both through the construct of allied partnership but also in the construct of their own security investments. And interacting with the leaders across Asia Pacific, you can just see that dialogue ongoing all the time. If I look at Europe, Europe too has a variety of issues and concerns that it's going to have to address. And I think a lot of that was evident in some of the recent summits and discussions about investments that the nations need to be making. And that's not all just prompted from U.S. pressure, clearly some of it is. But they recognize themselves that their own security environment is changing and that they need to take a more aggressive approach to investing in their security, again, in cooperation across all of our allies. I think we all recognize that we're in it together. We've got to make sure that we are capable of working together, both in an operating construct but also in a technology construct, to be able to do the things that we're going to need to do going forward. So I don't want to sound like an alarmist. That's not the intent. But the message is, clearly, from a market environment perspective, that our allies are going to be counting on us, and we're, as a company and I would say more broadly as an industry, stepping up to make sure that we're going to be there for them.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: And, Wes, I might just add that we are seeing in fact this year strong international sales growth. And as we look forward, international growth remains a critical part of the strategy as well as ultimately what we believe is our ability to grow this business.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Yeah.
Operator: Your next question is from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yes. Thank you very much. And let me join in the congratulations to you, Wes. I've probably seen you at work longer than the other guys and always been (58:06)...
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: It's been a lot of years.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: So yesterday, Lockheed Martin that has a mix somewhat similar to yours basically had a significant increase in their sales guidance and earnings guidance for this year that really touched every single one of their divisions and cited new wins put on contract earlier than they expected and quicker flow-through of the FY 2018 kind of budget add-ons that were done in March as the reasons. Could you comment, by your business areas, what are you seeing in that respect?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: So, Cai, maybe I'll start on that and then I'll let Wes and/or Kathy add color as they see fit. But maybe I wouldn't want to comment on anyone else's guide or their updates relative to that. But if I think about where we were for the year, when we gave our initial guide in January, we had a pretty strong, I would say, amount of growth in our sales guide. And you can pick whether you want to think back to actual 2017 on the 605 basis or on a 606 basis, but our view was that we had a strong sales guide that indicated that we could grow this business in 2018. And we continue to believe that, and that's relative to the three sectors' organic growth that we had at that point in time. If you think about Innovation Systems, it's had strong growth. You can see just the partial month since the acquisition closed, $400 million in sales, and they themselves had a strong first quarter of growth as well prior to the acquisition closing. And then, just thinking about the guide as well, we continue to hold strong margins in all of the sectors for the full year. So we feel pretty good about our guide. In terms of the impact of the 2018 budget increase you referenced. I would say that we've seen some of that impact in a few areas of our business, probably more so in Innovation Systems than others, and some of that being in the ammunition and missile side. Kathy, I don't know if you want to comment further on any of those areas.
Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Yes. So, Cai, I agree. We see strong budget outlook. And in response to that, our portfolio aligns very well to where we expect that growth to come from. Missile defense, munitions, space are all areas where we're seeing increase in growth and also focus in our own portfolio. And we do anticipate recognizing some of that opportunity within the year. And as Ken said, it was reflected in our guide earlier in the year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss with Barclays.
David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks a lot. Congratulations, Kathy, and Wes as well.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thanks, David.
Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.: That you.
David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Wanted to follow up on a question earlier about the cash-flow opportunity. Ken, you touched on a couple of programs at Innovation Systems. But if you just look at that business and how it's run historically, extremely-high levels of working capital, even ex-A350 and CRS. Could you talk about if you see anything structurally different that business versus kind of legacy Northrop from a working-capital perspective, because there's a huge opportunity there at least looking at it straight up? And then, quickly looking at the Q, Ken, it looks like intangible amortization in 2019, you're looking at like $275 million incremental. Is that a right number? Thanks.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: So I'll take the first part of the question first on the working capital side, and then we'll try to address the estimated amortization for 2019 on the PI. From a cash perspective, I would say that, look, we see room for improvement. We had been building some working capital over the last few years ourselves. There have been some changes in terms of the DFARS, and I think some changes in terms of customer behavior in terms of trying to use working capital as a lever. And so, we all need to react to that and figure out how we best manage that as we move forward. We're working it and starting to see some progress, and I fully expect that we will work it together with the Innovation Systems team and start to see progress on that side. There are some customers that are simply more challenging than others in terms of working capital. And we will simply have to evaluate those business deals as we are looking at them and determining whether or not the structure of the deal in terms of return, in terms of cash flow profile meets our standards of the type of business that we want to do. You've seen us be pretty disciplined in terms of if we see business that doesn't meet our expected returns, and that's beyond margin profile, also includes cash profile. But if we don't see that as something that we think is a good business deal, then we'll take a pass and leave it to somebody else. But we'll continue to evaluate all those deals as they come forward and, largely, I just think that we're working hard. We'll work hard with Innovation Systems, and I think there is opportunity in front of us. In terms of the PI question, we have estimated an amount of amortization for the full year of 2019 of something north of $280 million. I think in the 10-Q, it's $284 million for 2019. And I would just remind you that the amortization of those intangibles are on an accelerated basis in accordance with GAAP and based on the cash flow that is behind those intangibles. And we see that then amortizing down in 2020 and then really starting to reduce in 2021 and 2022 and beyond. So, still work to do, obviously. We're only a short period into our purchase accounting process, and we'll continue to refine that as we work forward from here to when that process is complete.
Stephen C. Movius - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Jamie, we'll do one more question.
Operator: Thank you. Your final question is from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good afternoon.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hi, Sam.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Sam.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: I wanted to go back to one of the questions just about overall performance and trying to kind of tease through this. So, just Wes, you made a comment that you don't see – or you see these as isolated cases. Is there any common thread across the different performance that could change? Or is it something that we may run into periods in the future where a confluence of isolated things come together? And then, I guess for Kathy, one of your roles right now is COO thinking about in the future. Is that something where you see a need for a COO overseeing a lot of the businesses as well in the future?
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: So, Sam, I think I would largely repeat what I said in response to Carter's question. We've had a good long track record of good execution. I see that going forward. I see that built into the way that we operate today. I see the way that decisions get made. And so, hard for me to say never, never, never, that would be a foolish thing to say. But I feel really good about the way the company is making its business decisions, the way that our teams approach the execution of the activities that we capture, and that we commit performance on to our customers. I see our customers having a lot of confidence in our ability to do that. So, if the direction of your question is kind of where does it go on a go-forward basis, I think we've got the right not only processes but also people in place as well as development programs in place, because you want to see this sustained well into the future to ensure that we're approaching our business the way we have been approaching our business. So it will require constant attention, and whenever there is a learning, to make sure that we really get the benefit of that learning, just as we've been doing for a number of years. So I do feel good about the process going forward. I appreciate especially what Kathy has been doing in her role as COO and enforcing that discipline and making sure that we are really thinking about things in a broad way as we enter into new activities and that if we do see something that has any form of issue around the company, that we're putting the full power of this amazing corporation on it to get it fixed early. So, again, I feel good about the vector that I see.
Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.: And, Sam, I'll just add that it was important to have this role with the integration activity that we were undertaking and standing up in IS and ensuring that we remained focused on performance across the company. But I view our risk management process as sound, and it needs to be executed at all levels within the organization and not reliant on a single role or individual. And it's my focus to ensure that our company continues to operate within our risk management framework and that as we bring new leaders into the company at all levels, that they are able to also execute this risk management process. And that's how we'll continue to be successful.
Stephen C. Movius - Northrop Grumman Corp.: At this point in time, I'd like to turn the call over to Wes for some final comments.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: All right. Thanks, Steve. Well, everyone, I think you've heard us say Innovation Systems a lot of times today but I'm going to say it again. I just want to say how delighted we are to have the Innovation Systems team join Northrop Grumman. This is such a great addition to our portfolio and to have it be accretive in 2018 is just tremendous for us. I appreciate the hard work by all of our team members around the company in continuing to drive performance and to position us well for our future. So thanks, everybody, for joining on our call and for your continued interest in Northrop Grumman.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's First Quarter 2018 Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. My name is Jamie, and I will be your operator today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Steve Movius, Treasurer and Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Movius, please proceed.
Stephen C. Movius - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thanks, Jamie and welcome to Northrop Grumman's first quarter 2018 conference call. Before we start, please understand that matters discussed on today's call constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities Laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which are detailed in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties may cause actual company results to differ materially. Matters discussed on today's call may also include non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled in our earnings release. I would also remind everyone that our first quarter results reflect the adoption of new accounting standards for revenue recognition and pension accounting. Schedules 4 and 5 of our earnings release present comparable prior period information, recast to reflect the adoption of these new standards. We will also be posting an updated company overview slide deck to the Investor Relations webpage. On the call today are Wes Bush, our Chairman and CEO; Kathy Warden, our President and Chief Operating Officer, and Ken Bedingfield, our CFO. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Wes.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thanks, Steve. Hello, everyone and thanks for joining us. 2018 is off to a good start with all three of our businesses delivering solid results. We continue to strengthen our company's foundation for a long-term profitable growth and I want to thank the entire team for their continued focus on sustainable performance. First quarter sales grew 5% over last year's first quarter driven by higher Manned Aircraft volume at Aerospace Systems and higher Sensors and Processing volume at Mission Systems. We're very pleased that our focus on program performance continues to demonstrate that we can grow segment operating income dollars as we both ramp up on early phase development programs and implement volume increases on several production programs. Net earnings and diluted EPS each increased 14% in the quarter, driven by sales and segment operating income growth and improvement in other items particularly pension and taxes which more than offset additional net interest expense. Based on the strength of this quarter's results, we're increasing our full-year 2018 earnings per share guidance to a range of $15.40 to $15.65. This guidance, of course, excludes the pending acquisition of Orbital ATK which we continue to expect to close in the first half of the year. We're very excited about the opportunity to bring together the capabilities of Northrop Grumman and Orbital ATK to offer new innovative capabilities to our customer community. Kathy will provide more information on the status of the acquisition. For cash, our typical first quarter pattern is the use of funds but we're pleased that this quarter cash from operations showed about a $200 million improvement over last year's first quarter. Capital spending during the quarter reflects our continued investment in support of long-term profitable growth and affordability for our customers. We continue to expect capital expenditures will be approximately $1 billion in 2018 and free cash flow will range between $2 billion to $2.3 billion. Our capital deployment strategy continues to call for investing in the business, managing the balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Our strong cash generation continues to allow us to strengthen our foundation for long-term profitable growth, as we invest capital to expand our workforce, ramp up on large new programs, and pursue new business opportunities. At the same time we remain focused on a strong balance sheet with some near-term debt reduction and returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We previously announced an off-cycle 10% dividend increase in January which was paid in March. We will consider the dividend again in May, as is our typical pattern. We did not repurchase any shares in the first quarter as we are continuing to pause our share repurchase program during the Orbital ATK transaction process. Before, I turn the call over to Kathy, I'd note that we're pleased that the bipartisan budget agreement provided for a significant increase in fiscal year 2018 defense appropriations, established the fiscal year 2019 top line for national security at $716 billion and extended the debt ceiling expiration until March of 2019. These actions should provide our customers a more stable and near-term funding environment in which to execute their important missions. Now I'll turn the call over to Kathy for an update on the pending Orbital ATK transaction as well as some operational highlights. Kathy?
Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thanks, Wes, and good afternoon everyone. I'm pleased to share the results of our operations this quarter, and I want to thank our team for the outcomes they delivered for our customers and our shareholders. Before, I talk about our current operations, let me touch on our pending combination with Orbital ATK. We continue to expect the transaction to close in the first half of the year. We received European Commission approval in February and we continue to support the regulatory process in the U.S. We also continue to make good progress on integration planning including potential cost, operational and capability synergies. We're excited about the innovative future offerings, we expect our combination to yield for our customers. Turning to our sector highlights for the quarter, each of the sectors captured business and achieved program milestones that position us well for the long-term. At Aerospace Systems in Manned Aircraft, we continue to ramp up on restricted activities and the F-35 program. F-35 sales increased by nearly 30%, and we delivered 20 center fuselage units this quarter versus 15 units in the first quarter of last year. We are demonstrating that we're successfully moving up the production curve required by our customers. In Autonomous Systems, Global Hawk celebrated its 20th anniversary and has now recorded more than 250,000 flight hours with missions flown in support of military and humanitarian operations. Triton, our next generation high-altitude, long-endurance platform is continuing to progress through low rate initial production. The Navy expects its first two operational Tritons will be deployed to Guam by the end of this year. To perform ISR missions for the Navy's 7th Fleet in the Pacific. Australia continues to make progress towards procuring Triton to support critical maritime ISR requirements. And we're very pleased that the State Department recently approved Germany's request to buy Triton. Space, we continue to make good progress on NASA's James Webb Space Telescope. With the arrival of the optical telescope and the Integrated Science Instrument module, all major elements of JWST now reside in our integration facility in Redondo Beach. The SBIRS Flight 4 satellite successfully launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in January and our payload is performing well as it is undergoing calibration. And on Advanced EHF we continue integration and test activities for our payloads for flights four, five and six. At Mission Systems, the Government of Poland signed a Letter of Offer and Acceptance for our Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command system or IBCS. Poland is the first international partner country to purchase IBCS and it will transform their integrated air and missile defense capabilities. With its truly open systems architecture, IBCS enables incorporation of current and future sensors and weapon systems to deliver an integrated air picture and command and control which provides a more capable missile defense system. Also at Mission Systems, our Ground/Air Task-Oriented Radar or G/ATOR achieved initial operating capability and has been approved for early fielding by the Marine Corps. This milestone follows the delivery of the final Lot 1 and Lot 2 LRIP systems to the Marines. Mission Systems has now delivered six G/ATOR systems to the Marine Corps. And we look forward to entering full rate production and getting G/ATOR's unprecedented capabilities to our war fighters. At Technology Services, we were one of three awardees on a 10-year recompete of the Information Technology Support Services contract for the Social Security Administration. Under this contract TS will continue to support the Social Security Administration's transformation initiatives and IT systems modernizations efforts. And we also successfully transitioned the Special Electronic Mission Aircraft or SEMA, a program for the Army, after our competitive capture of that program last year. We're addressing numerous new opportunities in the U.S. and with our allies around the globe and we're excited about the long-term growth prospects enabled by our portfolio. We continue, however, to be very disciplined about the opportunities we select to bid. For example, we recently elected to not pursue two bids, GPS satellites and the next generation of F-35 DAS, as we determined that they were not attractive for us. We believe that applying strict assessment criteria in selecting our business pursuits is critical to long-term sustained performance. Now I'll, turn the call over to Ken for a more detailed discussion of our financials.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thanks, Kathy, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll add my thanks to our team for their efforts so far this year. Today I'll briefly review our first quarter results and update our 2018 guidance. Before I get to our first quarter results, let me just comment on the number of moving parts in the first quarter. During the quarter, we began operating in a new tax regime and we adopted the new revenue recognition and the pension standards. We also implemented the new FASB guidance on presenting the impacts of the Tax Act on certain items recorded in equity, largely on amortized benefit plan costs. We did this all while working on integration planning for the Orbital ATK combination. I would also remind everyone that our guidance does not reflect the closing of the Orbital ATK transaction. However, guidance does include six months of net interest related to the debt issued last October related to the acquisition, and $50 million of transaction costs. We will update our guidance after the transaction closes which, as Kathy mentioned, we continue to expect in the first half of the year. Turning to sector results, Aerospace Systems sales were up 10%. Manned Aircraft was the major growth driver, primarily due to higher volume for restricted activities and the F-35 program. We also had higher revenue at Autonomous Systems and Space. Aerospace Systems' first quarter operating income grew 6% and operating margin rate was 10.4%. In addition to higher early phase development volume this year, last year's results benefited from a modest non-programmatic benefit that we didn't have this year. For 2018 we continue to expect AS revenue in the high $12 billion range with a low-to-mid 10% margin rate. No change to prior guidance. Turning to Mission Systems, sales and operating income both rose 3%. Margin rate was slightly higher than last year's first quarter at 12.9%. Sensors and Processing, which represents about 50% of MS sales, continues to be the growth driver for the sector. Higher volume is primarily due to electro-optical/infrared, self-protection and targeting programs as well as F-35 sensors and restricted activities. For 2018 we continue to expect sales in the mid-to-high $11 billion range with an operating margin rate of approximately 13%. No change to prior guidance. Revenue at Technology Services was slightly lower than last year's first quarter due to the headwinds we've previously discussed. Declines in programs like KC-10 and JRDC are being partially offset by ramp-ups on new programs like SEMA. For 2018 we continue to expect Technology Services sales will be in the mid $4 billion range with an operating margin rate of approximately 10%. No change to prior guidance. As we roll all that up, we continue to expect sales of approximately $27 billion and a segment operating margin rate in the low to mid 11% range, which reflects a portfolio that continues to have a higher percentage of early phase development work in the contract mix. We continue to expect our total operating margin rate will be approximately 12% reflecting the new pension accounting presentation. As you're aware, starting in 2018, we're required to split FAS into two pieces. First quarter FAS service expense reduced operating income by $99 million and FAS non-service benefit moves below operating income and increases earnings before income taxes by $120 million. I would also note that we are increasing our guidance for 2018 total net FAS/CAS pension adjustment to $960 million from $940 million. This update reflects an increase in our CAS estimate to $875 million from $855 million in our prior guidance. There were no other updates to our pension assumptions. While unallocated corporate expenses was comparable to last year's first quarter, we continue to expect 2018 unallocated corporate expense of approximately $250 million which contemplates the $50 million of Orbital ATK transaction expense and $200 million of ongoing corporate unallocated expense. I would also remind you that our unallocated corporate expense is typically higher in the second half of the year. Our guidance contemplates net interest expense of approximately $390 million, which is comprised of $300 million for our pre-Orbital ATK debt and approximately $90 million or six months of net interest expense on a debt we issued last October to fund the acquisition. Turning to tax, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 15.2%, reflecting the statutory rate reduction as well as a $26 million excess tax benefit related to employee share-based compensation. We now expect our 2018 effective tax rate will be approximately 18% in 2018. As Wes noted, we are increasing our 2018 EPS guidance by $0.40 to a range of $15.40 to $15.65. This assumes no change to our weighted average diluted share count. We continue to expect free cash flow of $2 billion to $2.3 billion after capital spending of approximately $1 billion. I would also note that we expect capital spending will be more heavily weighted to the first half of the year. So, it was a good start to the year and we look forward to continued strong performance from our team for the remainder of the year. I think we're ready for Q&A. Steve?
Stephen C. Movius - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thanks, Ken. As a reminder, we ask each participant to limit themselves to a single question. You can re-enter the queue, if you have additional questions. Jamie, please open the line.
Operator: Your first question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, good afternoon everybody.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hi, Noah.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hey, Noah.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: On the capital expenditure, I heard what you just said, Ken, it's front-end loaded and so the big increase in the first quarter doesn't sustain through the year. But I guess it will be up again year-over-year from a level that had already step functioned higher. So one, I mean how is that build out going? And two how much longer do you need to be at this level, what do we do beyond 2018?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Appreciate the question. I would say that, I think the CapEx investments that we are making are yielding the dividends that we expect them to. We've been I think taking a diligent approach to investing in capital, making sure that the business cases all deliver what they need to. So we're looking at the business case upfront and then we're again taking a look back to make sure that we're in fact making smart investments and that we're delivering on the investments that we're making. I think we're quite happy with what's going on there. In terms of the profile I would say, you know we've been talking about the fact that we've got to invest for the growth of the business. We also talked about the fact that the benefit of tax reform result in us allocating a little bit more to capital in 2018 than we had initially planned about another $100 million. And we continue to be comfortable with the $1 billion estimate for 2018. It was a little bit front-end loaded as we mentioned. Not a surprise to us. I think it was pretty consistent with our plan. We think that 2019 stays elevated as well and then we'll start to return to a new normal in 2020. And I would just remind you that the new normal is not necessarily consistent with where we were in the downturn a number of years back, we will be a significantly larger company at that point in time.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: And I would just add just as we think about those out-years, to a large extent it also depends on the degree to which we are successful in capturing new business. If we find ourselves in the fortunate position of being very, very successful that may require further additional investments over time. So we simply have to give you those updates as we get more information and have more insight on what our actual capture success turns out to be.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yeah, hey, good morning, guys.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hi, Ron.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hey, Ron.
Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: So, Wes, I was going to ask you sort of the unaskable question, but I'm going to ask it anyway. When you think about the opportunity that Northrop could have in classified space beyond kind of what we know GBSD and some of the other contracts. When we when we think about the combined company and I'm not asking you for kind of like post-merger guidance, but how – what framework can you give us to think about the opportunity space that's open to you guys after the company is combined with Orbital ATK versus today, because it's my sense there's a bunch of opportunities out there that you just have a better chance of getting as a combined company if you could do that.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Yeah, your question is right on the mark and really goes to a big part of the reason that we are so excited about the pending transaction. It's a very complementary match in terms of what the two companies today do in space. As you know, Northrop tends to focus on the more – the larger systems that have a set of mission applications that is attendant with that class of platform whereas Orbital ATK has demonstrated a very, very significant capability in the small and medium size. And I would say more agile class of spacecraft. And if you think about what is happening in the space environment today, we are clearly moving into an arena where we need a mix of those capabilities to address the set of missions that we need to address, particularly given the contested environment that is not only the future of space, it is today of space that's on us already. So if you think architecturally about the capabilities that are needed to both address the threat that we have in space and to do the mission that we want to conduct in space those architectures are inherently a blend of those classes of capabilities. So our ability to bring to the customer set a full range of offering will be significantly enhanced with this coming together of the companies, because as I said it is very complementary. So it's a sort of very much of an opportunity to create, we believe significant revenue synergy as we go forward by having that full set of capabilities available to us to make our offerings to our customers.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Peter Arment with Baird.
Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hello, Wes, Ken, Kathy.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hey, Peter.
Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hey, Wes. Maybe just on Technology Services, just trying to get a better understanding of how we should think about the growth profile. I know there is some one-time programs that are winding down, KC-10 you mentioned and some others. If we're just looking out and given the backdrop of the budget now in place, how should we be thinking about kind of the long term growth of that business.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Yeah. Kathy, why don't you address that for us?
Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Yeah. Thanks, Wes. So, Peter, as we look at that business there is a significant portion of the business that is growing as a result of their support and sustainment to other parts of our portfolio in our company accounts for about 20% of the Technology Services portfolio. And we've seen that grow year-over-year. So the offset to that is some of the programs that we've talked about in the past that have been winding their way through the portfolio, a wind down of KC-10 most recently and the wind-down of the VITA program anticipated this year. However, we are replacing that with good quality business and you see that sustaining the margins of the Technology Services organization at a very healthy level. So we're still really pleased with our portfolio and the synergy that it has with the rest of our business, particularly as we look forward to their ability to sustain and support modernization of the systems we build.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.
Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks very much. And good afternoon.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hi, Seth.
Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Kathy mentioned the decision that that you guys made not to bid on some additional work on F-35. And I wonder as you look out on that program and you're in a bunch of different places on the aircraft, as you think about maybe some of the challenges between wanting to have a level of returns and profitability that you target versus holding on to work that you have, how do you think about balancing those things given the direction that the program's gone?
Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thanks for the questions, Seth. We look at each of those opportunities as they come. As you know, we have a significant portion of the F-35 program, not just the center fuselage that AS builds, but within Mission Systems three of the electronic components. You specifically are referencing my comment about the DAB, the upgrade of that system and we did take a look at that and decide that that was not an attractive business to us. And so even when we've been building the sensor for a number of years and doing it quite well as we have with DAB, we continue to deliver 100% on time with that sensor. We looked at the future procurement and decided that it wasn't a good attractive business deal for us. And so we'll continue to apply that same discipline and not just to the F-35 program and the modernization efforts that we see there, but across the portfolio generally we are using that discipline.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: I would just add, Seth, that when we think about the mix of things on F-35, there's a wide array of activities that we perform and they each have their own sort of unique business arrangements and business profile and we continue to be very optimistic and are positive on F-35 as an important part of our business. We are delighted with the approach that we've been able to bring to, as Kathy pointed out, very high quality and on-time delivery of all of our elements. We are delighted to be taking on additional work through the sustainment activities that are in front of us on F-35. So F-35 is a very, very important program to us. The partnership is very, very important to us, but as Kathy points out, we do take a look at every aspect of our portfolio from a business case opportunity and in a broad sense and make very discrete decisions on those. But I would not want you to and I wasn't quite sure where you were going with your question. I would not want you to see that particular decision as somehow reflection of our view of the F-35 program. We're very positive on that program. See it is as absolutely critical to the future security of the nation, our allies and we're big supporters as you know of F-35.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.
Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC: Hi. Good morning, everyone.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hi, Sheila.
Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC: On Aerospace Systems margins, they've been quite strong despite mix. Can you maybe give us some color on the moving pieces in the quarter? And then just more broadly, how should we think about progression of margins in that program when it comes to development programs? Is it productivity in year two or do development margins stay flat throughout until you enter outright production?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thanks for the question. I'll start and if Wes or Kathy wants to jump in, feel free. I would say that AS margin is largely being driven by mix. We know that the biggest impacts on margin are mix and performance and I would say that largely the sector is performing on its programs and we're seeing a bit of compression from where they've been in the past from largely the early phase development work that we've taken on and the volume that that's driving. And we're pleased that they do have a strong portfolio of production programs that are performing well and are enabling us to hold strong margin in that sector while taking on the early phase work that we have. In terms of looking forward, I would say, I'd reference back to Wes's comments. In some respect, the margin profile for AS, as we look forward, is going to be driven by our success on some of the future early phase pursuits that we are working on. GBSD probably being the largest, but certainly other opportunities, some in the restricted space at that sector as well. So we're excited about the performance at AS. Significant growth this quarter at the top line, 10% sales growth, growing margin dollars and maintaining strong margins and really driven by performance at all three of the divisions within Aerospace. So we're excited about how it's performing and where it's going. Kathy?
Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.: I'll just add that, as Ken said, when we look at early stage development and production programs that mix can change the margin profile, but execution is really the core of delivering strong margins. And I've been very pleased with our Aerospace Systems sector performance on their contracts that is allowing us to deliver with this mix, strong margins in each of those programs, whether they're early phase development or production.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Melius.
Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC: Hey, good afternoon.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hi, Carter.
Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC: Wes, I wanted to – if I could ask you briefly about James Webb and the – not necessarily the contract there. I mean, I realize the contract type means that you don't have much exposure financially. But you think about the performance and execution, clearly some of the commentary from NASA around things like quality escapes and training deficiencies and stuff like that (00:31:04) it just seems sort of un-Northrop-like, I think, given what you guys have done over the last several years. Can you just give us some color on how that evolved and if that's an isolated kind of performance issue or how seriously you're taking that and how we should think about it? Just any color would be really helpful. Thanks.
Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thanks, Carter. I'll take that. As we talk about James Webb, it's really important that we think about what that system is. It's a one of a kind and the first of a kind; it's a real technological leap in the mission to explore space. For those of you who aren't familiar with it, it actually will help us look back 13.8 billion years to when our universe was formed at the earliest stars and galaxies to understand the origin. And so when you think about a program like that, it is quite an engineering phenomenon. And the good news is now we have all that flight hardware, it's fully complete. The new launch date does reflect additional time for integrating and testing the telescope and the spacecraft. And it's important for us that mission assurance is the top priority; that we continue to work diligently with NASA to make sure that when we launch, we have full mission success. So we are partnering with NASA to ensure adequate steps are being taken to do that. You asked about some of the challenges that we've encountered and when people are doing things for the first time ever, there is learning that happens. And so we are ensuring that all of the training that we're giving our people continued to be a focus so that we can give them the best chance of success here. But doing something for the first time does come with some inherent risk and we and NASA are partnering to identify that and successfully mitigate it so that we can get this successfully launched and able to fulfill the space exploration mission that we all want to see be successful.
Operator: Your next question comes from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.
Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: Hey, thank you, guys. We saw some incremental prioritization of NGAD (00:33:31) with the most recent budget request and I'm kind of curious to know how Northrop is positioning itself on that program. Or maybe more broadly, how you're thinking about that program developing over the next 5 to 10 years? Thank you.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hunter, let me just sort of say broadly and I will not get into any specifics on that class of future activity, but broadly as our nation looks at the set of things that we're going to need to be able to provide our military to ensure that we continue to have technological superiority, this is going to be an important effort. We clearly have very significant capabilities that will be supportive of that effort and we intend to be engaged in this in a very serious way. So the details of all of this will be emerging over time and not, again, something that I can say anything in particular about today. But I see it as a very positive reflection of the Department's serious intent to ensure that we as a nation are doing the right things to maintain technological superiority. So I'm really happy to see the support for it and we of course will be engaged.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hi, Doug.
Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. I wanted to go back to follow on Sheila's question because if you look at a lot of the development work you've won, the Aerospace and Mission Systems, they've each moved to a point with more development work where they've been in more than 50% cost plus. And so if you look at where you are today, what does the mix look like in those two production versus development or cost plus versus fixed price? And given that you've got some big long-term contracts, how do you see that mix evolving over the next few years?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: So, Doug, let me take that on. I would say and we don't normally put a lot of numbers at the sector level around some of the mix, but I would say that AS is heavier cost type than the other sectors, probably 60% plus given the development work that they've taken on. And at the same time they do have a strong portfolio of production programs that are delivering solid margins that are able to offset some of the development work. Now, we've tried to focus on the fact that not all cost-type work is the same. And the earliest phase cost-type programs where you've got still the most risks to burn down are generally where you see the highest margin pressure. And in fact there are some cost-type programs that have very good solid margin booking rates. So I wouldn't try to think of cost-type programs as being homogeneous in terms of margins or risks or things like that. As far as Mission Systems sector, Mission Systems continues to run more than 50% fixed price and I don't remember the exact number. But if you go and look at some of the new revenue recognition disclosures in the 10-Q, I think they're in the last footnote. There is a couple of charts on kind of revenue breakdowns and you can find some more information there in terms of how the sectors break down. But largely that's the way I would characterize it. I think its representative of the power of our portfolio. We have a strong mix of programs and there's a strong mix of programs across not only different customers, across the different sectors but across the lifecycle in terms of development, production and sustainment. So I think it's very healthy and you know we're seeing the benefits of that as we look at our results even as we've taken on the development work that you reference.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: And, Doug, one thing I would add is it's pretty clear that this administration is intent on addressing the modernization issues. And consequently I do believe that they are going to work hard to get some of these new activities underway here over the next couple of years in particular. And the natural question will be as to your point about balance or mix between development and production will be the timing, the advent of additional new development work versus transition production. So there's a little bit of uncertainty as to the exact timeline for the onset of some of these really big additional new development activities and how that will phase with transitions of current development activities into production. But just from a broad strategy perspective, it's going to be important to us to be successful in the capture of those and the key development activities that we're focused on. And to the extent that that happens sooner than some of the current development activity transitions into production that could put additional pressure if that were the case for some limited period of time as we experienced the transition into production of other activities. So it's hard to call it right now because there is that variable of the timing of these new development activities, but we are intently pursuing them and we will be very focused on supporting the customer in terms of the startup of those efforts as quickly as they desire to get them on contract.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Research.
Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Thanks so much. Good afternoon.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hi, Rob.
Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Hi. I wanted to follow up really on Doug's question perhaps. I was trying to get some sort of color of what sort of percentage of sales in the quarter was under the classified umbrella? And whether you're getting any indications from your customer that they may be looking to put more of your work under classified going forward?
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Rob, I would just say broadly that we do see a trend in the direction of additional restricted activities. I think it is a reflection of the security environment that we are all operating in these days, that the growing understanding that drive technological superiority means that you actually need to keep a number of important aspects of activities classified. And so a little bit of Back to the Future in some respects in that way. So I do expect that there will be a continuing trend in that direction and how much, what percentages, it's not something that we go into detail on, but we'll make it even a stronger focus of ours trying to ensure that we're providing good and adequate information to the investment community to understand the nature of our business. But I do see that as a longer term trend.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: And, Rob, I would just point out that we don't disclose that information quarterly but as Steve referenced there will be a new IR deck posted to our website, the Investor Relations webpage and that will have the latest information on our full year 2018 estimated revenues and customers and sources and things like that. So I would just reference you there.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC: Yes. Thanks so much for taking my question. So you have no bids first on the F-35 DAB, you were the incumbent and it's very rare for an incumbent not to no bid an upgrade of a system they already have. So maybe give us a little more color there? And also on your decision to no-bid GPS, was that impacted at all by the issues you're having with James Webb and the issue on the Zuma? Thanks so much.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thank you, Cai. Just broadly the GPS decision had absolutely nothing to do with anything else going on in the space portfolio other than a relative comparison of the attractiveness of the different opportunities that we're pursuing there. And a look at – where it makes the most sense for us to invest our resources to pursue those opportunities. And so we see actually a quite a good array relative to the earlier comments that I had when Ron asked the question about the space environment. So again it's how do individual opportunities stack up relative to our other opportunities and what's the best use of our resources to go and pursue those and support the customer community. It is not unheard of for an incumbency position, if you will, to take a different view of the next step of any activity. To some extent, the experience that we had on X-47B, everyone thought well, we're a shoo-in on MQ-25 why don't we just go do that. And when we looked at that deal, we said I don't think so. So we look at each and every one of these opportunities and test them aggressively to see is this something that merits our investment, merits the application of our broad set of resources and are we really going to be investing them in a wise way to pursue them. And that's how we conduct our business, that's how we're going to continue to conduct our business. I think it's served us very well over the years. There have been programs where we were the apparent winner and then the terms and conditions changed and we decided not to pursue them. And I think in general, those decisions have been good decisions for our company. So these we put into that category and I really appreciate the discipline within our organization in making those decisions. And the work that Kathy has been doing with our sector teams to really sort through the portfolio and make those important decisions, I think it's going exceptionally well for us.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC: Just as a follow-up on the F-35, was that contract terms were unattractive or was it that the technology path didn't make sense to you?
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: I won't get into the details of any individual bid decision that we're making. We look at all of those things and the list of things that we assess would include the items you listed plus quite a few others. And again it has to stack up relative to the other things that we're looking at.
Operator: Your next question that comes from the line of David Strauss with Barclays.
David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Wanted to ask about Orbital as we wait for the deal to close. Any update on some of the key parameters there in terms of how you're thinking about deleveraging post the deal, anything on intangible amortization, any update on synergies as you do more due diligence there? And then as a follow-up, Ken, wanted to ask about cash flow from operations looking beyond 2018, so as we think about 2019 and 2020 given the headwind you have from CAS? Thanks.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Let me start with the Orbital part of the question and then I'll try to address the cash aspect as well. And from an Orbital perspective, I would say that no update on PI at this point in time. We are continuing to work through all aspects of the integration of the deal. And from a PI perspective we'll be able to provide information after the deal closes. Clearly, there will be amortization of purchased intangibles once the deal closes. But I would remind you that there will be some amount going the other way in terms of a reset of their pension accounting, where you're no longer amortizing some of the actuarial assumption changes. From an accretion perspective, I would just say that we continue to be quite comfortable with the previous information we had put out with respect to the accretion and that being on GAAP EPS, economic EPS as well as free cash flow per share and driven by kind of the early cost synergies and then ultimately the operational and then the revenue and capability synergies as well. So, from that perspective, I think we continue to be very positive and excited about getting that closed. With respect to the question on cash, I would say that, as we look forward, and we don't provide guidance past 2018, obviously. But as we look forward from a cash perspective, this should be a business that is a strong generator of cash. We are growing the business; we are maintaining strong margin rates while we grow, growing margin dollars and turning those dollars into cash. CAS has been a component of our cash flow. But I firmly believe that we ought to be able to, as we look forward, develop our growing business into growing cash. And I don't see CAS reductions as a significant headwind to that profile.
Operator: Your next question comes from Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good afternoon.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hey, Sam.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hey, Sam.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: So when you give guidance in January we were still under a CR, the 2018 budget deal hadn't been done and now we have an agreement at least for 2018 and some projections for 2019. How should we think about when that starts to materialize for you? Is that something that can help this year or is it something that's really 2019 and beyond? How should we think about that additional spending?
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Yeah, you know Sam, I appreciate the question and maybe I'll just take your question as an opportunity to reflect a little bit more broadly on kind of what we're seeing from a budgetary perspective and where I see things going over time. Yeah, I really do think we are at an inflection point in many ways in our military history, if you would. And if you look back over the last decade and a half, we've kind of had three big things going on that have put us in a position today where we really would rather not be. On one hand, we've spent a lot of our treasure and our capacity in dealing with the violent extremist organizations around the globe, very appropriately; we had to do that. But during that period there was something happening around the globe that's really important to understand. There was a very rapid globalization of technology and innovation hubs that created capabilities in other parts of the world that really weren't there if you turn the clock back into the 1990s. And then sort of partway through that timeframe, we threw ourselves a curve ball and we self-imposed these tight constraints in our ability to invest in ourselves when we enacted the Budget Control Act as a nation. So all of those things together really created a major opening for our competitors to contest the U.S. military primacy and contest it across a lot of different domains. And from my perspective, I think our competitors took full advantage of that opening. Those who might be adversaries in the future looked at that as a real opportunity. So if you add all that up and think about where we are, today we sort of have this major deficit of capability. And as we think about that as an inflection point, I think it's clear that we're just going to have to invest in some very significant military modernization. So I think you have to look at this across these issues of the CRs and just think about it in a more aggregated macro perspective of the things that we've got to do. Now, you hear a lot of talk about recapitalizing the triad. We clearly have to do that. That's sort of a foundational element of our security posture. But that's not enough, that's not an adequate tool to ensure that we can protect our interests around the globe. So you see and what the DoD is doing, both recapitalization of the triad and a strong focus on recapitalizing the conventional force structure and that in itself sort of spans all of those different domains. And it's clear, if you look at – your question was about budget – if you look at the budget and what the DoD is doing, in the investment accounts, in particular, when we're talking about capability, if you turn the clock back to FY 2015, the investment accounts were about $160 billion altogether. FY 2018 is more like $220 billion. And that's a lot of growth over that period of time. But it's a recognition of the issue that we're having to deal with. And to your point with some clarity around FY 2019, the President's budget has those investment accounts moving up in sort of the $238 billion range. We know it takes typically sort of on average a couple of years for those types of appropriations to translate all the way through into outlays and to revenues at the company level. So this is a kind of a flow through the process and everybody's trying to move more quickly these days. So we'll see if that doesn't get accelerated little bit. But as we think about the next number of years in front of us, those threat issues are not going away. It's not only in the U.S. but we see our allies also making increases in their budgets, their defense budgets to deal with these concerns and these issues. And I think we all understand that historically defense budgets have largely been driven by the threat environment and I think that's what we're seeing right now. So we've been working hard over a lot of years to position our portfolio, including the pending acquisition of Orbital ATK to enable our company to be at the center of this investment in modernization that is being driven by the threat environment that we see around the globe. So I kind of look past these CRs even though they are a great source of frustration for everybody in the defense community, but think about where the budgets are going, why they are being driven in that direction and what that means for the application of technology and capability? And I see us well-positioned for that. We are investing significantly to make sure we're going to be able to support our customers and the work that they're doing and that they're going to need to continue to do for some time. And quite frankly others in our industry are making big investments in that way as well. So I appreciate the question because I think it's important to stand back and look at this in that broader context and kind of understand what it means in terms of where we're heading.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.
George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC: Yes, I wanted to go back to the comments on fixed price versus cost because, Ken, if you do look at the Q, I mean, it disclose that in Aerospace the cost type contracts dropped from 63% in the first three months last year to 59% this year with pretty rapid growth in the fixed price contracts. So does that trend continue? Does it reflect growth in the F-35 being the biggest part of the piece or exactly where do we stand on it?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Sorry, George, can you run me through the numbers part of your question, again? I didn't quite catch that.
George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC: Yeah, the Q discloses that the cost-type contracts were 63% last year down to 59% this year. And obviously the fixed price sales grew quite rapidly over 20% and the cost only grew 4%. So my question is, is this just a unique quarter and we're going to revert back to higher cost type percent or is this the beginning of a trend where cost-type contracts are going to steadily go down in Aerospace?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Yeah, George, I guess, you know I would say that one quarter does not make a trend. And that we've seen the F-35 program at both AS and MS seeing strong growth this year's first quarter over last year's first quarter. And with respect to some of the questions about the cost-type side of the business, again that's why we're trying to parse out the cost type into the various phases of that work. And, again, I'd reference my earlier comments on not all cost-type work is the same and some delivers very strong margins. There is relatively mature cost-type work that is almost mature production, but kind of constantly changing. And I would say that we'll see how the rest of the year plays out, but we expect to see growth in both the development programs as well as the production programs. Those will split and you can think of them as being cost type on the one side and fixed price on the other. But there clearly are other cost type programs that are more mature in their life cycle, and might look to have a risk and margin profile more akin to fixed price production than to some of the early phase development. So it really is a pretty broad array of scope of work and of lifecycle that we deal with here.
Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.: And I'll just add that it depends on what we win this year as well. Ken spoke to the portfolio as it exists today and how it plays out, but we have some opportunities that could change that if we win them.
Stephen C. Movius - Northrop Grumman Corp.: And Jamie, I think we'll do one more question and finish it up.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse.
Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: If I could just ask two quick ones, I think they're quick since I'm at the end here, but one for each of you. So, Wes, you had a lengthy detailed answer to Sam's question, but is there a way to do something akin to what Lockheed did yesterday where they talked about the omnibus and $7 billion worth of plus ups beyond the President's request out of the 2018 omnibus. Is there a way to quantify what you've got on a similar basis or at least talk about what you're competing on, if not all those are awarded yet? And then Ken, I wanted to ask you the 10-year up to 3%, if you could give us some sense of where that the marks the pension?
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Yeah, let me just say broadly, we're really pleased of course with how the FY 2018 budget came out. And clearly we have a lot of opportunity associated with some of the things that were added. But my focus always on our business is to make sure that our stuff is in the base. And it's nice if we get things added, but I want to make sure that we're focused on the things that are really at the level of priority they're going to be in the base budget. And as we saw that, that looks really good and we're happy with a number of things that were added as well. So, I think it was just a overall reflection of the importance of the nature of the work that we're doing and the sets of capabilities that we're providing to our customers.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: And on the pension side, I would say that if we think about the guidance we gave for 2018, it was based on a discount rate of 3.68%. From that time to your question about the 10 year Treasuries, I think 10-year Treasuries are up roughly let's say 70 basis points, maybe 70 basis points to 75 basis points. So, I'll just remind you that every 25 basis points change on the discount rate would result in about a $70 million change in our FAS expense, and a little shy of $1 billion change in the liability. So that's the sensitivity around that. Obviously, it's sensitive to more than just the 10-year rate, and you've really got to look at the entire curve and how that works. But I think rough order magnitude, that's the sensitivity you're looking for. And I would just remind you that if you think about FAS and CAS, as I'm talking here, I'm referencing FAS which is more sensitive to changes in those assumptions than CAS is. CAS continues to be based on a 20 – it's either a 20 or 25-year average discount rate, and therefore, is less sensitive on that. And we also have a little bit more smoothing on asset returns on the CAS side than we do on how we apply FAS accounting. So the FAS side is more sensitive.
Stephen C. Movius - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Wes, final comments.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: All right, well, I see that we're a minute past our hour. So I'll wrap up quickly by again thanking our team across the company for their outstanding work and delivering a really strong start for 2018. So thanks everybody for joining us on our call today and thanks for your continuing interest in our company.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2017 Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. My name is Dahana and I will be your operator today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Steve Movius, Treasurer and Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Movius, please proceed.
Steve Movius: Thanks, Dahana, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's fourth quarter and year-end 2017 conference call. Supplemental information in the form of a PowerPoint presentation is available on our Web-site. Before we start, please understand that matters discussed on today's call constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which are detailed in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties may cause actual Company results to differ materially. Matters discussed on today's call may also include non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled in our earnings release and supplemental PowerPoint presentation. I would also note that as of January 1, we adopted the new revenue recognition and pension accounting standards, and today's earnings release contains pro forma schedules that present comparable prior period information recapped to reflect the adoption of these new standards. On the call today are Wes Bush, our Chairman and CEO; Kathy Warden, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Ken Bedingfield, our CFO. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Wes.
Wes Bush: Thanks, Steve. Hello everyone. Thanks for joining us. Before we discuss our 2017 financial results, I'd like to comment on our capital deployment plans in light of the improvements that we expect to net income and cash flows resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was passed in December along with the benefits of our outstanding pension plan performance. Ken is going to cover our detailed guidance a little later in the call, but the bottom line is that these improvements will enable us to take several actions, as intended by the tax legislation, that support our economy and the long-term interest of our shareholders, customers and employees. These actions are all well aligned with our long-standing capital deployment strategy. We saw three important opportunities as we analyzed the implications of these improvements. First, it's important that our employees receive an economic benefit from this legislation and from our Company's performance. We've elected to provide our employees an annual additional contribution to their retirement accounts, an amount each year based on our competitiveness and our overall Company performance. For 2018, the contribution amount can be up to $1,000 per employee if we perform well. All employees, except senior management, participating in our annual incentive plan will be eligible for this new benefit. This approach is well aligned with our performance culture and our performance-based compensation philosophy. Second, we're focused on making capital investments in our Company that will drive our growth over the long term, support affordability for our customers, and of course generate solid returns. Investing in our Company continues to be the highest priority of our capital deployment strategy. These investments benefit our customers through enhancing our ability to serve them and also enhance our business opportunities and enable us to grow and provide more opportunities for our employees. Last year, our capital expenditures were approximately $900 million. We are increasing that investment to approximately $1 billion this year. And third, we have a long-standing policy of paying our shareholders a competitive dividend based on a payout ratio tied to pension-adjusted net income. With the growth in net income and reflecting this policy, we announced this morning an off-cycle dividend increase of 10%. As you know, our normal annual dividend assessment occurs each May and we expect to return to that cycle in May of this year. Let me focus now on our financial results. 2017 was another strong year for our Company and for our shareholders, and I want to express my appreciation to our team for their continuing focus on performance. We delivered solid financial results and our total shareholder return was approximately 34%. We returned more than $1 billion to our shareholders, while continuing our strong level of internal investment. We also took a major step to broaden our portfolio for the future with the pending acquisition of Orbital ATK. We continue to be very positive regarding the benefits to our customer community and all of our stakeholders of bringing our two companies together. As our fourth quarter and full-year financial results demonstrate, our strategy for long-term profitable growth is gaining momentum and generating results. I'm very pleased that our team remains focused on sustaining top performance. All three of our businesses posted strong sales, higher operating income dollars, and robust cash generation. 2017 sales rose 5% and segment operating income increased about 1%, reflecting an increase in percentage of early-phase development work. Our segment operating margin rate was 11.5%, total operating income grew 3%, and our total operating margin rate was 12.8%. 2017 earnings per share were $11.47 and cash from operations totaled $2.6 billion. Before tax reform impacts, net earnings grew 6% and earnings per share increased 9% to $13.28. We had a very strong finish to the year in terms of cash. You'll recall that last quarter we indicated that we would consider pre-funding our pension plans if tax reform was enacted. With the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December and the lowering of the corporate tax rate to 21% starting in 2018, we made a $500 million pre-tax discretionary contribution to our pension plans in late December. 2017 cash from operations before that contribution increased to $2.9 billion, which supported our capital expenditures of approximately $900 million and resulted in 2017 free cash flow before the contribution of more than $2 billion. Our capital deployment strategy has not changed, and calls for investing in our business, managing the balance sheet, and returning cash to our shareholders. Tax reform enhances our ability to generate cash, further supporting this strategy. We continue to strengthen our portfolio through robust R&D, capital spending, and investing in our theme. We're focused on near-term debt reduction and returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. With respect to dividends going forward, we continue to target a payout ratio of 30% to 40% of pension-adjusted net earnings. Share repurchases remain an important value creation tool for our Company. We are however continuing to pause our share repurchase program during the Orbital ATK transaction process. Free cash flow in 2018 is expected to grow to $2.0 billion to $2.3 billion, which includes continued robust investment in our business. As I mentioned earlier, we expect 2018 capital expenditures to increase to approximately $1 billion as we expand our workforce, ramp up on large new programs, and pursue new business opportunities. Our 2018 guidance calls for continued top line and earnings growth, supported by strong operating performance from all three businesses. For 2018, we expect sales of approximately $27 billion and diluted earnings per share of $15 to $15.25. Ken will provide more detail on our 2018 guidance. As we establish our guidance for the year, we should remind everyone of the risk to our guidance associated with continuing resolutions and prolonged government shutdowns. As we address critical national security challenges and our military faces readiness issues and rapid advances by our near peers, it's more important than ever that our nation returns to a more timely and productive budget process. Continuing resolutions have damaged our military's readiness and eroded our modernization efforts. Industry stands ready to invest and innovate from next-generation technologies and capabilities but our Department of Defense customer struggle to efficiently plan and execute our national defense investment strategy in the face of perpetual continuing resolutions. In summary, 2017 was another strong year for the Company and for our shareholders, and we feel we are well-positioned to continue creating value for our shareholders, our customers and our employees in 2018 and beyond. As we move forward in 2018, I am delighted to have Kathy Warden as our President and Chief Operating Officer. Our operating businesses report to Kathy, including the new sector that will be established after the pending Orbital ATK transaction closes. Kathy will lead the integration of our two companies. So, now, I'll turn the call over to Kathy for an update on the pending Orbital ATK acquisition as well as some operational highlights. Kathy?
Kathy J. Warden: Thanks, Wes, and good afternoon everyone. As we reported last quarter, we currently expect the Orbital ATK transaction to close in the first half of this year. In late November, Orbital ATK shareholders overwhelmingly approved the terms of the transaction. The FTC is reviewing the proposed transaction in the U.S. in consultation with the DoD and we notified the European Commission on January 18 under the simplified procedure notice. As we prepare for integration, we are making good progress in our plans to combine our two outstanding companies after close. We believe that after the transaction has completed, our collective set of market-leading technologies and products, along with very compatible innovation-focused cultures, will enable us to better serve our customers' current and emerging needs. Our companies' common legacies and well-known reputation for innovation have inspired the name for the new fourth sector, Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems. This name reflects the heritage of both Orbital ATK and Northrop Grumman and highlight both companies' essential character, creative workforces, product and process innovations, agile operations, and cutting-edge technologies. Blake Larson, Orbital ATK's Chief Operating Officer, will lead Innovation Systems. In addition, Scott Lehr, Mike Kahn, and Frank Culbertson, will each continue in their existing leadership roles within the Flight, Defense and Space Systems organizations respectively. Maintaining this leadership team will ensure operational continuity and facilitate the integration of our two companies. We believe our combination represents a powerful opportunity to better serve customers through accelerated innovations applied to new product development and enhancement of our current offerings. Turning to our sector highlights for the year, each of our sectors captured business and achieved program milestones that position us for the long term. At Aerospace Systems, the Air Force awarded us a three-year $328 million contract to execute the technology maturation and risk reduction phase of a Ground Based Strategic Deterrent, our nation's next-generation ICBM system. We look forward to competing for the final downselect on this important program. On the Manned Aircraft side, AS delivered 74 F-35 units, an increase of 13 units over 2016, and we are well-positioned to ramp up further in 2018. On the E-2D program, we are in full production and completed the first flight of Japan's E-2D Advanced Hawkeye, and we are in discussions with the Navy regarding the next multi-year E-2D contract. In Autonomous Systems, we delivered the first operational MQ-4C Triton to the Navy in November and we signed LRIP 1-3 as we continue to ramp up on this important ISR program. Australia continues to make progress toward procuring Triton as their maritime ISR platform, and on Global Hawk we are working towards delivery of Lot 11 for the U.S. Air Force and NATO AGS, and we continue to work on delivering Global Hawk capability to both Korea and Japan. At Mission Systems, we continue to increase production rates on Sensors and Processing programs. We ramped up significantly on our F-35 sensor program, delivering 90 radars, which was double the number of units we delivered in 2016 and we achieved a significant milestone of delivering the 300th F-35 radar in November. MS delivered 78 DAS systems and 88 CNI systems this year, approximately 30% more than prior year deliveries. And we also continued to ramp up on SABR production for our U.S. and international customers. At Technology Services, we won the Army's $750 million Special Electronic Mission Aircraft program to provide contractor lifecycle services for the Army's fixed-wing ISR fleet. The award includes a base year contract and eight option years extending to 2027. The Army also selected TS to compete for more than $500 million in task orders to operate Army training centers across the country. And for international customers, Australia awarded us the sustainment contract for Air Force C-27J Spartan transport, and training work for the Saudi Arabia Ministry of National Guard continues to expand through our joint venture. Looking ahead, the substantial investments that we are making, both organic and through our pending acquisition, demonstrate our confidence that we will bring the right technologies and capabilities to address our customers' urgent need for affordable, technologically superior national security solutions in response to a rapidly evolving threat environment. Global national security needs are expanding at a rapid rate and we are investing to address those needs. Now, I'll turn the call over to Ken for a more detailed discussion of our financials.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield: Thanks, Kathy, and good afternoon everyone. I'll add my thanks to our team for their efforts this year, particularly in the area of fourth quarter cash generation, which was really outstanding. Before the discretionary pension contribution, the team brought in $1.9 billion in cash from operations in the fourth quarter, which was $400 million more than we generated in the fourth quarter of 2016, so kudos to everyone who contributed to that outcome. Today I'll spend a few minutes on 2017 results, but devote most of my commentary to our 2018 guidance where we have a few additional moving parts due to the pending transaction as well as changes in revenue recognition and pension accounting. As I go through our 2018 sector guidance, year-over-year revenue growth will be under the new standard for 2018 versus today's reported 2017 results. I would also note that our guidance does not include Orbital ATK and guidance only includes six months of interest related to the debt issued last October for the acquisition. We will update our guidance after the transaction closes, which as Kathy mentioned, we currently expect in the first half of this year. Turning to sector results, Aerospace Systems sales were up 5% for the quarter. 2017 sales were approximately $12 billion, a 10% increase. While restricted activities at Manned Aircraft drove a substantial amount of the year-over-year increase, all three AS business areas, Manned, Autonomous, and Space, posted higher year-over-year revenue. Aerospace Systems 2017 operating income grew 2% and operating margin rate was 10.5%, lower than last year due to the changing contract mix as we continue to ramp up on early-phase development programs. In addition, 2016 operating income benefited from a $45 million gain on a property sale in last year's fourth quarter. For 2018, we expect AS to grow at the top line at a high single-digit rate to the high $12 billion range. Growth in restricted activities will continue to be a major driver of revenue growth, along with continued ramp-up on the F-35 program. We expect 2018 operating margin at AS will be in the low to mid 10% range. For 2018, cost-type early-phase development work continues to grow at a faster rate than higher-margin production work, although we are seeing good growth in the production programs like F-35. Turning to Mission Systems, sales rose more than 4% for the year, operating income rose nearly 1%, and operating margin rate was 12.8%. Sensors and Processing was the biggest growth driver for the sector, up more than 10% due to higher volume for F-35 sensors, electro-optical/infrared self-protection and targeting programs, and communications programs, as well as the SABR radar. For 2018, we expect sales to grow to the mid to high $11 billion range with an operating margin of approximately 13%. Primary revenue growth drivers include continued ramp-up on combat avionics and communications programs, including F-35 sensors, SABR radar, and infrared countermeasures. With respect to F-35 volume across the Company, I would note that it is expected to grow to approximately 9% to 10% of total expected 2018 revenue. Now let me turn to Technology Services. Technology Services 2017 sales were slightly lower than the prior year at approximately $4.8 billion. 2017 operating income grew more than 2% and TS ended the year with a strong 11% operating margin rate. For 2018, we expect Technology Services sales will be in the mid $4 billion range, with an operating margin rate of approximately 10%. Lower 2018 revenue is primarily due to expected declines in the KC-10 and JRDC programs. Lower revenue for these programs is being partially offset by growth in other programs. As we roll all that up, we expect sales of approximately $27 billion with a segment operating margin rate in the low to mid 11% range, reflecting a portfolio that continues to have a higher percentage of early-phase development work in its contract mix. We expect our total operating margin rate will be approximately 12%, reflecting the new pension accounting presentation. As you are aware, starting in 2018, we are required to divide FAS into two pieces. FAS service expense of $400 million is reflected in operating income, while $485 million of FAS non-service income is moved below the operating profit line and reflected in earnings before interest and taxes. This change in presentation reduces our estimated 2018 operating income margin rate by approximately 180 basis points compared to the prior presentation standard. Slide 6 in our PowerPoint presentation provides a bridge to 2018 guidance under the new accounting standard. Our 2018 FAS assumptions are based on a 3.68% discount rate and 8% expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and reflect our 2017 net plan asset returns of more than 16%. Slide 7 and 8 in our PowerPoint deck summarize our pension estimates for years 2018 through 2020, and Slide 9 summarizes 2019 sensitivities to changes in assumptions. In aggregate, on a GAAP basis, the year-end funded status of our plans was 85% versus 80% at the end of last year. Our qualified plans also remained well-funded at 89% versus 84% at the end of last year. Holding all current assumptions constant, our required contributions remain minimal for the next few years, at $87 million in 2018, approximately $100 million in 2019, and approximately $200 million in 2020. Beyond 2020, we continue to expect required funding will be lower than CAS recoveries. We expect 2018 unallocated corporate expense of approximately $250 million, which contemplates about $50 million of Orbital ATK transaction expenses, in addition to $200 million of ongoing expense consistent with prior year's guidance. I'd also note that our guidance contemplates net interest expense of approximately $390 million, which is comprised of $300 million for our pre-Orbital ATK debt and around $90 million or six months of net interest expense on the $8.25 billion of net interest expense to align carrying cost with our current expectation regarding timing of the close of the transaction. After the close, we will update our financial guidance. Turning to tax, we now expect an effective tax rate of approximately 19.5% in 2018. Our 2018 earnings per share guidance of $15 to $15.25 assumes no change to our weighted average diluted share count. Just a few comments on cash in 2018; we expect free cash flow will range between $2 billion and $2.3 billion after capital spending of approximately $1 billion, and approximately $150 million for incremental interest and unallowable costs related to the Orbital ATK transaction. These 2018 items largely offset this year's cash tax reform benefit. We also expect our cash generation will be heavily weighted toward the second half of the year, as is our typical pattern. In summary, we had an outstanding year in [2018] [ph] and we look forward to continued strong performance from our team in 2018. I think we're ready for Q&A. Steve?
Steve Movius: Thanks Ken. Dahana, please open the line for Q&A. Dahana, would you please open the line for Q&A?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein.
Sam Pearlstein: [Indiscernible] once a year was down 5%, which I was a little surprised. Can you comment on that in terms of any big items that might have shifted out of 2017? And then secondly with regards to the CapEx of $1 billion, when should we expect that to moderate? Does this continue beyond 2018, does it continue to go up from here?
Steve Movius: This is Steve Movius. Hopefully we have everybody back on the line. I apologize for the technical difficulties. Ken was addressing a question on backlog and capital expenditures. I think we got through the backlog before the line went dead. So, Ken, can you address the questions on our capital expenditure profile for the next – going forward a little bit?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield: Sure, Steve. Thanks. With respect to capital expenditures, investing in the business continues to be the first priority of our capital deployment strategy. Given the benefits of tax reform on our cash flows including accelerated depreciation as well as an opportunity set that we expect will generate long-term shareholder value, we firmly believe we are making good investments for our Company and our shareholders. We continue to expect that capital expenditures will remain elevated in 2018 and 2019 before starting to return to a new normal that reflects a larger business. In terms of our overall cash generation, as we look forward, we expect to continue to generate strong cash flows, further aided by tax reform. Looking at 2018, we do have additional CapEx as well as $100 million to $150 million in costs from incremental interest and transaction cost related to our pending acquisition of Orbital ATK. We also see our CAS pension recoveries moving down a bit based on our strong pension asset performance in 2017. So there is some impact on 2018 cash flow. I'd refer you to the pension slides in our PowerPoint deck for our latest estimates of CAS and our required contributions which we've laid out through 2020. While lower CAS reduces cash flows, it provides a competitive advantage for us as we pursue future opportunities.
Wes Bush: Let me add a little bit on to that as well, and Sam, I appreciate you asking the question and I think it's an important item with respect in particular to capital expenditure for us to focus on. And Ken said it exactly right, we have a current approach to this that based on how we see things today sort of plays out. I just want to caveat that a little bit. Should we continue to be extraordinarily successful in capturing business that goes with some capital investment, we're going to reflect that into our plans on a go forward basis, and the focus obviously is making sure we're capturing good business so we can get really good returns. And with the benefits of tax reform, the way we do that math, it makes it quite attractive. So, what Ken went through I think is an important perspective just in terms of our current visibility on it, but I fully expect this team to continue to be exceptionally successful in capturing good new business for us. And if investment comes with that, with great returns, then we will plan and execute on CapEx accordingly.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland of Melius Research.
Carter Copeland: Good morning, Wes and Ken, and welcome Kathy. Wes, I don't know if you were ever looking to get into the conference call hosting business but you might have an opportunity.
Wes Bush: Yes, it might be a natural adjacency here.
Carter Copeland: Yes, exactly. You are the techie. Look, a couple of questions, just quick ones. One, I know you can't provide much detail here but I'm hoping that given the debate around your margin rates, given the sort of increasing opacity that the classified mix provides, you made the comment, Ken, about cost-type development work growing faster than the other. Is there any way you can give us any sort of color about the quantum of the difference there? Is it modestly faster, significantly faster? I know you can't quantify in numerical terms, but anything I think to help to give the market some color around just what you're seeing from the underlying business standpoint that might be helpful to us?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield: Sure, Carter. Let me see if I can address that, and then Wes or Kathy can jump in if there's additional comments. I would say that as you look at the business, first of all, if you looked at the straight-up cost-type versus fixed-price mix, you would see it's pretty consistent 2016 to 2017 at about 55/45. But if you peel the onion a little bit further, and it's hard for me to give you too many numbers because much of it is on restricted business, but if you peel it back further, there's clearly within the cost-type portfolio more mature programs that are generating relatively strong development cost-type margins and those that are early-phase programs where we're still working our way through some of the early risk reduction and some of the early engineering phases of those types of programs, and what we're seeing is a relatively robust growth, a pretty rapid growth in those types of programs within that portfolio. And if you were to look specifically at AS, just to pick one of the sectors, you would see in particular there that it is growing at a rapid clip within AS. I don't know that I can put more specifics around it, what I will tell you is that as we've looked at our portfolio, we do have a nice mix of both development and production, we do see that we've got some production opportunity in front of us in terms of starting to generate some of the higher margin on those higher volumes as they work their way through. But right now, those early-phase programs are growing a good bit faster than those production programs.
Wes Bush: Yes, Carter, I'd just add a little bit to it. Your remark as to sort of the opacity of the restricted work, just to give a framework here, we're in a world today where the nation's ability to really have technological superiority is going to increasingly depend on the ability of the government to execute more and more of our programs in a restricted manner. It's just the nature of the world today. So, I do anticipate that we're going to just continue to see a bit more growth on the restricted side just as an aggregate fraction of the business. So, we're working hard to be thoughtful about that to give as much insight as we can, but inevitably the programs themselves are not going to lend themselves to giving much transparency in that regard. But one thing I can say as just sort of a broad perspective on it, the development work on restricted programs, because they are typically at the higher end of technology and consequently carry more technological risk, do tend to be more the classic cost-plus development type contracting. It's not universally true but that's sort of a general characteristic of them. And as you know, that type of work comes with a little bit lower margin rate but a lot less risk than some of the other types of development work, and that little bit lower margin rate development is more than offset over time because when you actually get into the production side of things, you do pretty well. So, when we think about the opportunities and we think about it in the context of a likely growing restricted baseline within the Company, there will be that pressure for some period of time, particularly as we are successful in capturing that business. But the payback for our shareholders and for our customers ultimately over the longer term is exceptionally good. So, I know there's a little bit of anxiety out there about what the margin rate might be in AS this quarter or next quarter, and the team is highly motivated to do really well, and that just comes down to good old basic program performance, but when you look at it from a portfolio perspective, we're going to work really hard to capture even more of this business because it is putting us in a good place for the long term.
Carter Copeland: Wes, just to maybe get at it a different way, you mentioned program performance, so in aggregate the program performance has clearly been strong positive for quite a period of time. If you were to look at the fundamental blocking and tackling of risk identification, retirement milestones, do you see any material difference in the performance of the restricted contracts versus non-restricted, maybe get at it that way?
Wes Bush: Kathy, why don't you take that one.
Kathy J. Warden: Sure, thanks. Carter, no, we don't see a significant difference as we are ramping up on these early-phase development programs in how we are managing risk and opportunities. Our team is incentivised to identify those risks, manage them over time, seize the opportunities, and that's the same performance characteristic that you've seen from us, it's just the phase of the program that we're talking about has different characteristics based on early-phase versus late-phase development and then of course production.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield: And Carter, I'd just remind you that to the extent we had any major program issues or charges, we'd clearly be required to disclose those, and we've had a pretty clean record of not having disclosed program write-downs, and we continue to make sure we're doing our best to perform in that regard.
Wes Bush: [Indiscernible] we feel particularly good about work of our team. That's the primary focus in the Company, program execution. Doing well for our customers means doing well for our shareholders. Thanks Carter.
Carter Copeland: Great. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman of J.P. Morgan.
Seth M. Seifman: So, two questions; Ken, when you talk about the $2.6 billion or so, I think you said of F-35 revenue in 2018, how would you characterize that level of activity relative to full rate production? And secondly, Wes, when you look at the additional CapEx, I think it makes sense to everybody, surely makes a lot of sense to me, why you're doing it. But when you think about how these incremental returns will show up to shareholders, should we be thinking about more sustained growth in the out years, faster growth in the out years, higher margins in the out years, or some combination of all three? And then when you look at what you and Raytheon and General Dynamics have said this quarter, it's all a lot of additional CapEx. Is there something about this particular defense ramp that we're entering right now that's maybe different in terms of the level of investment required versus even if we go back far to other ramps the level of capital spending?
Wes Bush: Yes, those are really good questions.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield: I'll take the first part, and before I get to the F-35 question, let me just make a comment. Given the technical challenges we had there for a few minutes, we're going to extend the call past 1 o'clock. So if you're able to stick with us for a few more minutes, we're happy to take questions past the 1 o'clock. But on F-35 specifically, Seth, I would say that think of those sales that we talked about as being roughly two-thirds AS, one-third MS, I would say the vast majority of those sales are essentially at full rate production at this point. We are performing on LRIP programs, but we are facilitized for the production ramp, we are ready to address the additional units Kathy talked about, the increased deliveries we made this year. And so, I would say, we'll likely be in low rate production for a few more lots here. I think the plan is through like LRIP 15 or something about that. But we're essentially in full rate production at this point and we're looking forward to being in a scenario where we get funded, get on contract reasonable times, and we are able to generate along with our partners, as Lockheed has talked about, additional margin that will move into those production lots. And I guess maybe just to comment a little more specifically on the mix, it might be more like 60/40 or 55/45 AS to MS, but that would be the F-35 comment.
Wes Bush: And Seth, let me address sort of the broader question you asked about capital, which I think is a really important question just in terms of framing what I see going on in our Company but also what I see going on in our industry right now. There was a period, a long, rather long, incredibly long period of time we were in a declining defense budget environment. It was difficult to reach a conclusion to expand capital when we had limited visibility and the visibility we had generally looked down for a while. So, on one hand there's a little bit of pent-up demand to deal with that period of time, but on the other hand, and I think this is the more important part of it for investors, we foresee just given the nature of the threat environment that we observe around the globe today and the number of dimensions in that threat environment that are evident, we foresee a period of time here in front of us, a rather significant period of time in front of us, where our nation and our allies are going to need to invest in their national security to deal with this, and those investments in many cases are going to be different types of investments and at the national level to ensure technological superiority, and we've got to get back to a place of technological superiority. So, when you're talking about doing that type of thing, you can't just patch up your old facilities and do this incrementally. You have to step back and say, what is the capacity that industry needs to support the customer-strategic objectives here? And it's causing all of us to look carefully at our factories, it's causing us to look at the capacity that we have for our employees to do work in a much higher technology arena than may have otherwise been considered, and it's causing us to add employees. We hired over 8,000 people last year. That's not net, that was our hiring. We have an ongoing wave of retirements across our industry and those were evident in our Company as well, but we netted well over 2,000, pushing into 3,000, people last year and we did the same thing the year before. And this is just a reflection of the fact that our industry is gearing up to support the nation's needs and the needs of our allies. Our investments are not only here in the U.S., they are in other countries around the globe where we're doing business, and our allies depend on us to do the things we need to do from a facility and tooling and capability perspective so that we can support them as well. So, from an investor standpoint, this ought to be seen as good news. This is industry saying, we see a runway of business in front of us, and thereby good returns in front of us if we're doing it smartly, that necessitates these investments and we think it's a smart thing to do. So, it won't all happen tomorrow. That's not the nature of our business. As Ken said earlier, it's a long-cycle business, but it's what we need to do to be well-positioned to support our customers and to enjoy the economic benefits of doing well for our customers for the long term, and that's the way we're thinking about it.
Seth M. Seifman: Great. Thanks very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard of Vertical Research.
Robert Stallard: Just one for me, Wes, regarding the recent tax reform and also what Northrop has been doing on some of its bids over last say 6 to 12 months, you've backed away from a couple of programs because you felt the returns weren't what you'd like them to be if you were to win them. Does tax reform change that and could you be a little bit more aggressive on bidding going forward?
Wes Bush: Tax reform helps in terms of things like the returns on the programs that we are working on, the returns on the investments that we're making. It does not generally turn a bad business into a good business. And I hate to be that sort of sharp contrasted approach to describing it, but the things we walked away from [indiscernible] were just bad business deals and there isn't enough juice in any variant of tax reform I've seen to turn a bad business deal into a good business deal. So, I don't have any – if the question is, do we perhaps have a different model of how we're going to look at things going forward on the decisions we make programmatically, if there's something that's right maybe on the margin, yes, that might have an effect, but if it's fundamentally a deal where the balance of risk and return is in the wrong part of the coordinate system, I don't think that will change much of that optic. I do think, and I'm delighted particularly in the context of the last question, that tax reform is doing a really good job of motivating investment in our country, and you can see it in our industry, you can see it in other industries as well, and to the extent that the programmatics line up in the good business part of the coordinate system, investments applied in that direction make even more sense in the context of tax reform. So, to the spirit of your question, I believe that's a very strong positive for us and I am delighted to see broadly how business is responding to this. I think it's the right thing for companies to be doing right now to take these benefits of tax reform, support their employees, and invest in our nation's economy. So I think there's good alignment here.
Robert Stallard: That's great. Thanks Wes.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt McConnell of RBC Capital Markets.
Matthew McConnell: Could you share an update on the Orbital ATK close? I know you've said first half, but any other clarity there, and what are key milestones that are left? And then maybe related to that, when you think you could resume the buyback? Is there a certain leverage threshold or any other catalyst that could drive the buyback resumption?
Wes Bush: Kathy, why don't you talk about Orbital? I know you referenced a lot of these in your remarks.
Kathy J. Warden: I did, and so, we still see it closing in the first half of this year, really nothing to add to that other than my comments about where we are in the regulatory process. We have filed on January 18th in the short form process in the EU and we continue to work through the FTC process in the U.S.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield: And Matt, with respect to your question on share repurchase, we wouldn't see ourselves getting back into the market until after the close of transaction, and in fact end of the first window after – first open window after close.
Wes Bush: As I remarked earlier, Matt, this share repurchase we see as an important element of our value creation strategy. Obviously all these other things we're doing have an influence on the timing, but over the longer term it's part of our overall capital deployment strategy as it has been for about as long as I can remember. So, it's something that we'll get back onto when the time is right.
Matthew McConnell: All right, great, thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Arment of Baird.
Peter Arment: Maybe just quickly on the CR, this is obviously something you've been dealing with for seven some odd years plus, but can you give us an update, if we don't see a deal here in February, the impacts you see, and are several of your programs exempt where you'd still be able to see additional increases? Thanks.
Wes Bush: Yes, you said it right. It's been a number of odd years that we're having to deal with these things. In this year in particular, here we are on our fourth CR, we're about a quarter away through the fiscal year, and as challenging as this might be on the industry side, the real pain here, and I mean pain with a capital 'P', is on our customer side. This business is just really, really tough on them and they – fortunately for our nation and for our allies around the globe, we have a military that figures out how to get things done, but it's just not right that they are put in this position. So, we are all doing what we can to support our customers. I think that's the main thing to take away from the industry perspective with respect to the CR. And whether or not individual programs will be impacted kind of depends on the nature of how the customer approaches Congress on things like anomalies or other aspects, other tools they might have, but I think there's just a growing recognition not only on the helm but across our country that this has gotten to the ridiculous point, and we've got to get it solved. And I might add one other aspect to this that I think is really important for people to understand. It's not simply enough to pass the appropriation. We still have the Budget Control Act in effect. So, Congress has to both pass an appropriation as well as deal with getting these crazy constraints off the table. And I just want to keep that out there because sometimes as we're struggling through CRs and the media is focused on the probability of a shutdown and the rest, there may be some who would think, okay, all we got to do is get the appropriation done, and that would be a mistake to think that. We got to get the appropriations done and we got to get these caps removed so that we can be doing the right things from a national security perspective.
Peter Arment: Appreciate that. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned of Bernstein.
Douglas Harned: I have got a philosophical question about tax reform. Obviously it's a very important thing, you described the benefits and a lot of people are getting benefits from this, but this industry is somewhat unique in that in the sense the customer is giving the tax benefit but also in a sense has the power to take it away as the customer. And we've heard a range of views on it when you look long-term, and on one side we've heard some say that this is a windfall that defense companies will receive in perpetuity because the FAR uses operating margins, not after-tax margins, it doesn't change very often, and the government wants to make the industrial base healthier; but the other side is that it's been a highly profitable industry and the benefit will likely go away over time because the Pentagon is well aware of the benefit and a lot of people don't have a high appetite for higher defense profits without a clear mechanism to ensure the added cash goes to investment; would suggest that you could see changes made to FAR, you could see contracts move to lower levels of pricing within FAR ranges that sort of incorporate the knowledge about the after-tax benefits. How do you see this playing out, which direction do you see this going over the next few years?
Wes Bush: Doug, let me give you my take on that because we could all hypothesize that we could see a lot of changes in the regulatory manner that might sort of wipe out the benefits of tax reform. All I can say is, industry is going to be very responsive on the positive side or the negative side. I just talked about tax reform being a strong motivator for the increased capital investments that we're making and our ability to continue strong R&D investments. Should there be a view that regulation is ought to change to take some of that benefit away, I think it would be self-defeating for our customer community, because it ultimately would discourage us from investing on their behalf, it would discourage us from the type of things that we need to be doing to support their capacity and technology needs for the long term. We are a business and we have to make decisions in that context. So, I'm sure there were maybe some folks who might look at this through a very narrow lens and read some bad conclusions, but hopefully those with a broader view of economic realities will see this the way it's intended, which is tax reform is intended to help grow our economy, and to do that we've all got to step up and make investments and get things done the right way. And if the incentives for doing that get flipped over the other direction, the behaviors will flip over the other direction. So, I really think it's that clear. So, while as I said there may be some who look at this through a narrow optic and don't really understand the broader views, I certainly hope and would proceed with the team that we've got at the Pentagon at the senior level that a more strategic view would stay in place. And this goes by the way as well to folks on the Hill. There was a lot of support on the Hill for making sure that we're doing the right things for defense, including encouraging investment, and tax reform is a big part of that. So, we can always get caught up in the possibilities of what might happen, but as always, industry will react one way or the other, and right now I'm pleased to see industry reacting in a positive way and driving investment.
Douglas Harned: But Wes, as an earlier question that touched on this, because if you think of a program, a proposal, and let's say the DoD decided to make the margin less at an operating level, but it you or others looked at that and on an after-cash basis, on an ROIC basis, that program now made sense to invest in, wouldn't you expect that people might be willing to accept a slightly lower operating margin if the all-in cash return was still there?
Wes Bush: No, that's what I would – maybe I didn't do a good job of describing it, but I would call that a decision on the margin, not to use the exact margin term you were using, but those are sort of incremental decisions. And if you're down to the point where on a bid you are scratching to get an incremental amount of margin, you're probably not doing the right things in terms of your architecture or your cost structure. So I would actually argue there are other things you ought to be thinking about doing to get your returns there than relying on the increment from tax reform. That's not the place we found ourselves in, in some of these major bid decisions that we've looked at, and I won't go through them over the last years, but a number of them for those who did take the business on, a little bit of change in the tax rate would not have made a difference in their – whether or not they made or lost money. And so, I'd be careful about just looking at this as sort of a narrow impact on the decision space. It's more about the way some of these bids are fundamentally architected.
Douglas Harned: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr of Cowen & Company.
Cai von Rumohr: So, your guide for 2018 has AS up approximately $1 billion, and kind of as I look at my model, the two big drivers are the black work and F-35, and given that F-35 at AS was not up as much as it was in MS, it would look like it's got some catch-up. So, in my model, F-35 and the black work grow at approximately comparable levels, and you said that F-35 probably has some more margin upside going forward. And if I put those two thoughts together, I would think that the margins at AS this year would be, comp would be flat, and yet you have them down somewhat. What am I just missing in all of that?
Kathy J. Warden: So, I'll start, Cai, and then ask Ken to add on. But you are right, the restricted work and the F-35 work are two major drivers to the AS growth next year. As Ken was alluding, we saw significant ramp during the course of 2017. We still have some of that ahead of us on F-35 in 2018. We are completing LRIP 10 and beginning to work LRIP 11. So we still have some growth toward full rate production there at AS. And so, those two drivers, both contribute to being at lower margin rate than we will realize once we hit full rate production. So, in the case of restricted, it's early-phase development work and in the case of F-35 we are marching our way up the curve toward those full rate production margins.
Cai von Rumohr: Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro of Shapiro Research.
George Shapiro: So just following up on Cai's question, the implication to me would be that we get into 2019 that the margin probably goes up, so that this year would mark the low point for the margin. Would that be a correct assumption?
Wes Bush: George, as you know, we won't guide for 2019, but all I would say for all of our businesses is, we continue to use an incentive system that motivates the businesses to grow operating margin over time, and I've found over the years our team is quite responsive to those incentives. So, we'll see how things work out, but right now we can only guide for 2018.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield: And Wes, I would just reference to your earlier comment that we certainly continue to pursue other development work including GBSD and on the downselect and next-gen Joint STARS and some others, and as we are or to the extent we are successful on those, we certainly could see some mix pressure that would further resolve from that beyond 2018.
Wes Bush: Yes, absolutely.
Steve Movius: So, Dahana, I think we can take one more question.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski of Drexel Hamilton.
Pete Skibitski: Wes, I'd love to hear your thoughts about the [new management] [ph] strategy that was revealed recently, and of course we had a leak of the Nuclear Posture Review as well and they are talking about a lot of specific modernization areas that are needed, was wondering if you saw Northrop's capabilities kind of line up well with those lanes, were you surprised by anything, and does it kind of support or reinforce your decision that you made on OA?
Wes Bush: I would say just broadly, Pete, this is what we've been getting ready for, for a long time. We're ready to support the strategy that's laid out. Our capabilities are in incredibly tight alignment with where we see the nation going as reflected in those strategies. And I am really excited about the Orbital ATK acquisition and the merger of our two companies. I think we're going to be able to help our customer. It's a very pro-competitive pulling together here of the companies' complementary capabilities, and I think it's just highly supportive and highly aligned with what I see as the team in the Pentagon, and more broadly the national security team, has pulled together with these strategies. So, I'm looking forward to us being able to help a lot.
Steve Movius: This concludes the Q&A. Wes, any final comments?
Wes Bush: Just to wrap up again, thanking our team for their incredibly great work in 2017. We keep raising the bar here in our Company on performance and I'm just delighted to see how our team embraces the opportunity to excel. So, thanks everyone for joining us on the call today and thanks for your continuing interest in our Company.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

On the call today are Wes Bush, our Chairman, CEO and President; and Ken Bedingfield, our CFO. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Wes.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thanks, Steve. Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us. It was a very productive quarter, and I'd like to extend my appreciation to our entire team. We continue to generate strong financial results, higher total sales, higher operating income in all three of our sectors, strong EPS growth, and strong cash generation, while taking strategic actions to further strengthen and enhance Northrop Grumman's long-term profitable growth vector. I'll first provide an update on strategic actions and then discuss our third quarter financial results and 2017 financial guidance. On September 18, we announced our agreement to acquire Orbital ATK for $134.50 in cash per share, approximately $7.8 billion in cash plus assumed debt of about $1.4 billion. On October 13, the company issued $8.25 billion of unsecured senior notes to finance the acquisition and pay related fees and expenses. This combination represents a compelling value creation opportunity for the customers, shareholders, and employees of both companies. We fully expect our complementary portfolios of leading technologies, along with our aligned and innovation-focused cultures to yield significant value creation through revenue, cost, and operational synergies. We believe all of our stakeholders will benefit from expanded capabilities, accelerated innovation, and greater competition in the critical global security domains of space, missiles, and missile defense. In addition to these compelling strategic benefits, we expect Orbital ATK will be accretive to our earnings per share and free cash flow per share no later than the first full year after acquisition. I want to provide brief updates on our efforts with Orbital ATK to meet the closing conditions. First, we understand Orbital ATK is scheduled to conduct its shareholder meeting on November 29. Second, the acquisition of Orbital ATK is subject to regulatory approval by authorities in the U.S. and in the EU. The FTC is reviewing the proposed transaction in the U.S. in consultation with the DoD, and the European Commission is reviewing it in Europe. We expect the transaction to receive thorough reviews, and we are engaged with the agencies in an effort to facilitate those reviews. We continue to expect the acquisition to close in the first half of 2018. We also announced several leadership transitions that will be effective at the first of the year. Gloria Flach, our Chief Operating Officer, and Sid Ashworth, Corporate Vice President Government Relations are retiring at the end of the year. Gloria and Sid have made tremendous contributions to our company and to our nation, and I want to thank them for their leadership in our company. Kathy Warden will assume the role of President and Chief Operating Officer at the beginning of the year. Kathy has led Mission Systems since 2015 and prior to that she led our former information system sector. Our sectors will report to Kathy and she will also be responsible for the integration of Orbital ATK when that transaction closes. As we've previously announced, we plan to initially operate Orbital ATK as a fourth sector to ensure a strong focus on program performance and operational stability. With Kathy assuming her new role, Mark Caylor will be the new President of Mission Systems. Mark has successfully led our Enterprise Services, corporate strategy and M&A functions, and previously served as our Corporate Treasurer. Shawn Purvis our current Chief Information Officer will lead our Enterprise Services team and Lesley Kalan will head our Government Relations team. All of these transitions will be in place at the beginning of the year and we'll ensure we continue to have a strong operating environment through the duration of the Orbital ATK integration process and into the future. As I indicated earlier, we had another strong quarter in terms of financial performance. Sales rose to $6.5 billion, a 6% increase resulting from higher sales at Aerospace Systems and Mission Systems. Year-to-date total sales are also up 6% and based on these results, we now expect 2017 sales to increase to approximately $25.5 billion. Higher sales drove a 4% increase in third quarter segment operating income and 3% growth year-to-date. We continue to expect a mid-11% segment operating margin rate for the full year. Total operating margin dollars increased for both the quarter and the year. Operating margin rate was 12.9% for the quarter and 13.2% year-to-date. We continue to demonstrate that we can grow operating income through a combination of sales growth and performance as we execute on a portfolio of important new development programs, as well as ongoing production programs. We generated strong earnings per share growth for both the quarter and year-to-date periods. Earnings per share rose approximately 10% in the quarter and 13% year-to-date. Based on those results, we now expect 2017 diluted earnings per share of $12.90 to $13.10. Cash from operations and free cash flow were both strong for the quarter and support our guidance for the year. Capital spending reflects our continued investment in support of long-term profitable growth and affordability for our customers. Our capital deployment strategy continues to call for investing in the business, managing the balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders. The Orbital ATK acquisition and our robust capital expenditures represent substantial investments for long-term profitable growth. During the third quarter, we paused our share repurchases as we were considering the Orbital ATK acquisition. Year-to-date, we've spent $393 million to repurchase approximately 1.6 million shares. $2.3 billion remains on our current share repurchase authorization. Returning cash to shareholders through a competitive dividend and share repurchases remains a priority for our company. Ken will address the operating performance of the sectors. But I wanted to touch on several of the business capture efforts with significant activities during the quarter. The Air Force chose Northrop Grumman as one of two teams down selected for technology maturation and risk reduction contracts for the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent. We received a $328 million contract to perform work in advance of full-scale development on the nation's next-generation ICBM system. Northrop Grumman has played a critical role in the U.S. Air Force's intercontinental ballistic missile system since its inception. As a trusted partner and technical integrator, we've mastered the complexities of its flight, launch, and command and control systems. We're very pleased with this win, and we look forward to the opportunity to provide the nation with a modern strategic deterrent system that is secure, resilient and affordable. With respect to other new platform opportunities, I know that many of you may have questions regarding the Joint STARS Recapitalization and the MQ-25 programs. We have notified the Navy that Northrop Grumman will not be submitting a bid on the MQ-25 program. Our assessment of the final RFP, which required a fixed price incentive bid for this development work, was that we could not put forward an attractive offering to the Navy that would represent a reasonable business proposition for our company. We continue to work with the Navy on a variety of important autonomous systems programs, and we look forward to addressing future opportunities to support the Navy in this regard. We have submitted a bid for the Joint STARS Recap program as prime, and our Mission Systems sector has submitted proposals for its radar to all the primes competing on this program. With respect to our bid as a prime, we feel that we, together with our partners, General Dynamics and L3, have put forward a compelling offer. We understand that the U.S. Air Force is conducting an assessment of whether to proceed with this program. We presently do not have any information regarding their evaluations, and we stand ready to support the Air Force as needed going forward on this important mission. I'll close my remarks by noting that we are still operating under a continuing resolution that expires on December 8, with fewer than 30 days remaining in the current congressional session. As our customers address a variety of national security issues, the readiness of our forces, the aging of our strategic deterrent, the increased vulnerability of our space assets, to name just a few, it's critical that funding to fulfill our national security missions is adequate, timely, and predictable. In summary, it was a very productive quarter in which we continued to generate strong financial results while taking strategic actions to enhance Northrop Grumman's long-term profitable growth and value creation for all our stakeholders. So, now, I'll turn the call over to Ken for a more detailed discussion of our results and our guidance. Ken?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thanks, Wes, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll add my thanks to our team for a strong third quarter and year-to-date results. My comments will cover our financial results, updates to our 2017 guidance, and I'll also provide some color on our recent debt offering. Starting with the quarter results, our strong operating performance combined with a lower share count generated another strong quarter of EPS growth. Positive earnings trends continued in the third quarter. Sales were higher at two of our three sectors, and all three sectors had higher operating income and solid margin rates. Moving to sector results and guidance. Aerospace System sales were up 11% for the quarter and 12% year-to-date. Manned Aircraft was again the primary growth driver for both periods as we ramp up on restricted activities. Higher F/A-18 and F-35 deliveries contributed as well. Autonomous Systems and Space also had higher revenue for both periods. Growth in restricted space activities is more than offsetting lower volume for programs like the James Webb Space Telescope and Advanced EHFs. In Autonomous Systems, the ramp-up on Triton and other programs continues to more than offset lower NATO AGS volume. Based on year-to-date results, we are increasing our 2017 sales guidance for AS to a range of $11.7 billion to $11.8 billion versus our prior guidance of $11.5 billion to $11.7 billion. Operating income at Aerospace Systems is up for both the quarter and year-to-date with operating margin rates of 10.8% and 10.7%, respectively. The trend for both periods relative to the prior-year periods largely reflects mix as we ramp up on Manned Aircraft development work. The mix impact on margin rates and Manned Aircraft was partially offset by improved performance in other areas, including a $56 million positive EAC adjustment on a restricted program. As you know, EAC adjustments at AS can be lumpy. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, the increase in net EAC adjustments at AS was $14 million. For 2017, we continue to expect a high 10% margin rate at AS. No change to prior guidance. Moving to Mission Systems. Sales rose 5% for the quarter and 3% year-to-date. Increased volume for sensors and processing programs contributed to higher sales for both periods and included increased volume on electro-optical, infrared self-protection and targeting programs, F-35 sensors and the SABR program. During the third quarter, Mission Systems also had higher volume on air and missile defense programs and their Advanced Capabilities business. Mission Systems' operating income increased 3% for both the quarter and year-to-date, driven by the higher sales volume. Operating margin rate was 12.8% in the quarter and 13% year-to-date. For 2017, we now expect MS revenue will range between $11.2 billion and $11.3 billion versus our prior guidance of $11.1 billion to $11.3 billion. Based on year-to-date results, we continue to expect an MS margin rate of approximately 13%, no change to prior guidance. At Technology Services, third quarter sales were slightly lower than last year and year-to-date TS sales are 2% lower due to the completion of several programs, as well as lower volume on the KC-10 program. Operating income was up slightly for the both the quarter and year-to-date, and TS continues to achieve a very strong margin rate of 11.2% for both periods. Based on year-to-date performance, we are increasing TS sales guidance to approximately $4.7 billion, the high end of our prior range of $4.5 billion to $4.7 billion. We are also raising TS operating margin rate guidance to approximately 11% versus our prior guidance of mid-10%. Our total segment operating income increased 4% in the third quarter and 3% year-to-date. And we continue to expect a mid-11% segment operating margin rate for the year. No change to prior guidance. Total operating margin rate was 12.9% for the quarter and 13.2% year-to-date. I would note that we had a $90 million increase in third quarter unallocated corporate expenses. The most notable single part of the increase was $27 million in Orbital ATK transaction costs. In addition, last year's third quarter unallocated was relatively low and included a $30 million benefit for state tax refunds. For the full year, we now expect unallocated corporate expenses of about $225 million due to transaction costs, as well as the higher run rate we usually see in the fourth quarter. This is a $25 million increase to our prior guidance of approximately $200 million. Higher third-quarter unallocated corporate expenses were partially offset by a higher net FAS/CAS pension adjustment. During the third quarter, we completed the demographic study that allows us to finalize our cash pension expense for the year. Based on the study results, we now expect CAS of approximately $1.02 billion versus our prior estimate of $960 million. We now expect 2017 FAS will be $435 million. In the third quarter, we conformed our methodology of accounting for administrative expenses across our various plans, which reduced FAS expense by about $25 million. So, we now expect the 2017 net FAS/CAS adjustment of about $585 million versus our prior estimate of $500 million. At the beginning of the year, we provided a CAS estimate of approximately $1 billion for both 2018 and 2019. We'll update our pension estimates on our fourth quarter call, but for your modeling purposes, barring a major market dislocation, we would now expect CAS recoveries will be in the range of $900 million to $1 billion annually for 2018 and 2019, as well as for a few additional years. At the beginning of the year, we estimated 2018 and 2019 FAS would be $400 million and $350 million, respectively. Holding our current discount rate and expected rate of return assumptions constant, we would expect 2018 and 2019 FAS of $375 million and $275 million, respectively, due to the upgraded demographics and the methodology change I mentioned earlier. FAS should continue to decline post-2019, again, keeping all assumptions constant. I would remind everyone that a 25-basis-point change in our discount rate changes 2018 FAS by approximately $70 million and a 100-basis-point change in plan asset return around our 8% expected rate changes 2018 FAS by approximately $50 million. I would note that our plans have a strong net asset performance of approximately 12% through September 30, and as you know, interest rates are lower now than at the end of last year, which would impact our 2018 discount rate. Regarding required CAS contributions to the pension plans, as we noted earlier this year, we expect approximately $100 million in each of 2017 and 2018 and $400 million in 2019. Holding assumptions constant, including our 8% expected rate of return, our 2020 required contributions would be almost $900 million. If our plan asset return hold at 12% this year, our $400 million required contribution in 2019 would decline modestly and our required contribution in 2020 would be reduced by about a third to roughly $600 million. I would also note that for the foreseeable future, we expect our CAS recoveries will continue to be greater than or equal to our annual funding requirements. We continue to monitor progress on tax reform, and if it makes economic sense, we would consider making a voluntary contribution to the plans this year. Moving to taxes; you saw in our release that we had some credits and deductions that reduced our year-to-date effective rate to 22.3%, and for the year, we're now expecting effective tax rate of 24.5%, which implies a fourth quarter tax rate of around 32%. As Wes said, we now expect 2017 diluted earnings per share will range between $12.90 and $13.10, which assumes that we will have weighted average shares outstanding of about 175.5 million versus our prior expectation of 175 million. Moving to cash; cash from operations totaled $938 million in the quarter. And after capital expenditures of $217 million, third quarter free cash flow totaled $721 million. Based on year-to-date results, we continue to expect free cash flow in the range of $1.8 million to $2 billion, after capital expenditures of approximately $900 million. No change to prior guidance. This guidance excludes any potential voluntary contribution I previously discussed. Just a quick comment regarding the new accounting standard for revenue recognition. We currently expect 2017 sales under the new standard will be modestly higher than 2017 as reported under the existing standard, roughly in the 1% to 2% range. This is driven by the conversion to cost-to-cost accounting from units of delivery on growing programs. Before I move to Q&A, I wanted to briefly touch on a debt offering we completed earlier this month. We issued $8.25 billion in senior notes in 3-year, 5-year, 7-year, 10-year and 30-year tranches at a blended rate of 3.14% to fund the Orbital ATK acquisition. Given the favorable interest rate environment, we were comfortable issuing the debt now with the provision that $6.25 billion of the debt has a mandatory redemption feature with respect to the completion of the Orbital ATK acquisition. The debt has a $0.15 per share net negative carry in the fourth quarter of this year and $0.20 per quarter next year. So, in summary, it was a great quarter, and we look forward to continued strong performance from our team for the remainder of the year. With that, I'll turn it over to Steve to start Q&A.
Stephen C. Movius - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thanks, Ken. Prepared comments run a little bit longer today than usual. So, I'd ask each participant to ask a single one-part question. Natalia, please open the line.
Operator: Your first question is from the line of Ronald Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hi, Ron.
Stephen C. Movius - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hey, Ron. Are you there? Natalia, let's keep moving.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Carter Copeland with Melius Research.
Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC: Hey. Good morning, gentlemen.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hey, Carter.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hi, Carter.
Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC: Wes, I know you don't want to provide guidance for 2018. This isn't a question to ask to get it. But I wondered if you might be able to give us some insight into the planning process? I mean, is that time of year to put together the plan if nothing else? You guys are meticulous planners. But you got a lot out there in terms of trying to manage growth. You're trying to close and integrate an acquisition. There's a very wide range of budget scenarios out there from caps to bigger numbers and what not. There's just a lot of moving parts as you put together that 2018 plan. Can you help us understand maybe what some of the risks and opportunities are, as you try to put all that together and manage it, just give us a sense of how you're looking at that for 2018 in terms of what the risk and opportunities are?
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Well, thanks, Carter. I really appreciate that question. It's clearly an exciting dynamic time at Northrop Grumman, and quite frankly, across our industry. And as you pointed out when we look at the timeline in front of us, and by the way, our planning is not just for 2018. We are a long cycle business, we think about things over a much longer cycle than year-to-year. And as we think about our business, it is a process that has, as you framed well, finding the right balance, and making sure that we are planning and allocating resources appropriately, while also being very clear-eyed about the opportunity set that is in front of us, and my experience over the years in the defense industry is that it's easy to become enamored with opportunities, it's much more difficult to have a discipline to look at them through the lens of both being assured that we can deliver for our customers, which we take incredibly seriously in our company, as well as being able to deliver for our shareholders and for our team over time. And so, our annual process is very thoughtful on in that we force ourselves to take a really hard look at things, and do it without attachment. It's easy to get attached to things that you've been working on and feel that you just want to keep going down the road, but sometimes it's better to get off that road. So, we are in that process now. We, as I mentioned during my remarks, announced some leadership transitions, we tend to announce those a bit before the end of the year as we did with these transitions in that we want those who will be in the seat at the beginning of the year to own the plan, and be both responsible and accountable for the execution of the plans, and that process is going well. You asked about risks and opportunities. Clearly, we're in an environment where our customers are asking us to do a lot of new things, and so that's a very good opportunity environment. We've been pleased to see the bipartisan support broadly for better supporting our customers then perhaps has been done over the last number of years with respect to budgets. The attendant risk with that is of course the process. We are unfortunately still operating under a continuing resolution. We have yet to get to a place where Congress has been able to figure out how to move past the Budget Control Act which it needs to do. And so, consequently, that imposes all source of challenges from a planning perspective not only for our company, but even more importantly for our customer community, and inherently, that drives risk. It drives risk into current operations and it drives risk into future acquisitions. So, that's an area that we pay very close attention to. We are growing as our other companies, not just in our industry, but around the country and around the globe, and with that growth comes the demand for talent, and as I think about the big important things in front of us over the next few years making sure we get it right on talent is right there at the top of the list. We are a company driven by the intellectual capacity, the hardworking commitment of our team, and making sure we continue to build that with the right team members as we go forward is just incredibly important. We had a good year last year and it looks like we're going to have a good year this year in terms of our recruiting efforts. I'm just absolutely delighted with the talent that we're able to bring into the company, both those with significant experience, as well as the talent that we're seeing coming out of universities, both here in the U.S. and around the globe as we're recruiting. So, I'm excited about that. And I'm also excited to see our customer increasingly focused on the more advanced class of technologies. That's an area of strong focus for our company. Clearly, there is an attendant risk that goes with that in terms of being able to mature and realize the technologies as we pull them into the programs, and it's another thing that we do in our planning process, is to really take a hard look at where we stand. We have a great group of technologists in our company. Pat Antkowiak, our Chief Technology Officer does a fabulous job of leading us through a clear-eyed look at those things. So, it's an environment that does represent quite a few opportunities for us, quite a few challenges to make sure we get it right, but I have a lot of confidence in our team in being able to sort through those things and come out with the right balance.
Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC: Great. Thanks for the color, Wes.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thanks, Carter.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.
Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good afternoon.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hey, Myles.
Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, Wes. This almost infrequent – or frequent occurrence of announcing no bids on contracts is interesting. And I wanted to probe a little bit. This is a third major program where you've chosen to not bid, and despite having what I'd view is better than average chances of winning. And I wanted to take it from a level of what is the government walk – effectively by Northrop turning down, entertaining these bids as a qualified bidder, what is it in these proposals that's turning the company off and is it a detriment to the industry and how are they going to attract those companies outside the industry if Northrop Grumman is kind of saying no to some of these?
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Yeah, Myles, let me give you a little flavor on that because it's I think important to look at each of these things in its own context and also through the lens of the individual companies, which are different lenses. And so, what I'm about to say, it doesn't suggest – is not intended to suggest that other companies don't follow similar principles. I can only say how it is that we think about things. When we're looking at one of these opportunities, let me be really clear, our objective is not just to win. Winning is great. It feels good on the day of an announcement. But if you can't really execute on it and deliver on it for your customer and your shareholders, then you've done the wrong thing. And we've worked hard over a long number of years in our company to have great clarity around what our objectives are. When you're entrusted by the U.S. or any one of our allied nations to do something in the defense arena, that's a real bond of trust you cannot afford to break. And we really look hard at executability under the terms of the RFPs that come out to make sure we can really execute. And so, sometimes, you might say we're a little tough on ourselves in that regard. But I just demand and our leaders across the company demand that we are clear-eyed about that. We do a lot of our own independent, whether you want to call them, black hats or red teams, or whatever we may happen to call them on individual bids, where we question ourselves aggressively to attest, can we really do this? And if we feel confident that we can, if there is good compelling evidence that we can, then we're going to go forward and make offerings that are intended to be attractive both for the customer and for the company. And in those cases where we don't see that outcome, then we feel we actually have a real obligation to be very clear with our customers about not only our decision, but the rationale for our decision. And in each of the cases that you mentioned, that has been our approach. And I would say in general, our customer has been appreciative of the feedback, not so much that they want to change things for any particular bid because they've made their decisions on how they're proceeding. But it helps them understand the way that industry is looking at these things, and I would say they've been very inviting of those conversations. So, I don't see anything particularly negative in all of this. It is simply a reflection of getting the right matches, so that the customer gets what they need and industry gets what it needs. And I intend for us to continue to have that high degree of discipline as we go forward.
Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Just to be clear, I'm sure you're making the right decision from the company perspective, I just hope the customer is kind of cognizant of the decisions they're driving for rational companies as well. Thanks. Thanks, Wes.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Yeah. Thanks, Myles. And as I said, that's why we feel that it's so important to be as clear as we can when we make one of these decisions to fully explain ourselves to our customers.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hello, everyone.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hi, Noah.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hey, Noah.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Wes and Ken, in looking back at the – at what you said when the OA announcement was made with regard to synergies. It looks like you actually broke out multiple buckets of synergies. So, there was – you had quoted $150 million run rate by 2020. But it looks like that was actually just in what you're calling cost, which it sounds like is primarily or maybe entirely just where there's duplicative cost between the two organizations, and then there's an additional bucket of operational, and then there's the additional bucket of revenue. Is that the right interpretation and can you size, even if it's directional or even in a really wide range of how those other two buckets could compare to that $150 million of duplicative cost?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thanks, Noah, for the question, and I'll start off. And if Wes has anything to add, he can jump in at the end here. We did. You got it exactly right. We did bucket into three parts, the first being cost savings. And I would say that is sequentially the first that we will expect to see. So, we're estimating about $150 million of annual cost savings by 2020. And we have modeled some cost that we will incur in order to get there. So, we've modeled – I believe we talked about $75 million in the first year and a half or so. We are looking beyond that at operational synergies. And you can think of those as being in the areas like supply chain and manufacturing where beyond the initial cost savings, we would look to find some additional synergies that certainly we would work to make sure that those drive cost savings as well, but we are not able to quantify that at this point in time. And then the third bucket is the revenue synergies. And what I will tell you is that that's probably the piece that's going to take the longest, both of us being long-cycle businesses, but we do expect that as we start to pass the cost synergies back to the customer over three to four to five-year period we would see the revenue synergy sort of filling in that reduction in the cost savings that accrue to us versus to the customer, and we will see the revenue synergies start to kick in and generate the margins to again fill in the gap of the synergies at that point in time. So, that's kind of how we're thinking about it. I hope that answers the question.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: I mean, is it something...
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hey, Noah. It's Wes. I would just to add. When we think about the value creation over time, clearly, the cost synergy part of it is important. It enables us to be more efficient, more affordable. As Ken pointed out, as time progresses and we enter into new contracts, we pass those cost savings back directly to our customer, which is a great thing. And if you look back over, at least, our history of the creation of our company and the cost synergies that were created, there was a lot of savings passed back to the customers over the years. But from a shareholder perspective, clearly, the reason you do something like this in our industry is not so much the cost savings. It really is the revenue synergies that get generated over time. And that's where we see this opportunity to develop new innovative offerings for our customers, offerings that might be harder for them to see in the marketplace absent this combination of very complementary capabilities. And to me, that's where the real excitement is. Clearly, we're going to be disciplined and focused on generating those cost savings. It's something that as a company over a long period of time that we've been good at doing and I intend for us to excel at this as well. But it's really in the domain of revenue synergy creation where we see the long-term value creation opportunity, both for us as a company and our shareholders and our employees, but also as important for our customer community that really relies on our industry to aggressively innovate and put new ideas forward for them and to create the ability to have even broader side of competitive offerings. So, that's where I think the most excitement is as we look forward to the future. Orbital ATK is just an outstanding company when it comes to the quality of the innovation, the ability of their team to continue to advance the state of technology and turn that into applications for their customers. And if you put that together with those similar qualities within our company, that's exciting.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: I understand. Thank you.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thank you, Noah.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thanks, Noah.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein.
Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good afternoon.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hi, Doug.
Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi. I want to follow on that discussion because, Wes, you've been in and around space for a long time. And when you looked at ATK, Orbital ATK, and you think about opportunities – revenue synergy opportunities, what are the capabilities that you think are most important that they can bring to Northrop Grumman's portfolio?
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Well, thanks, Doug. As remarked a couple of times, what's great about this is, is so complementary. We have almost no overlap between the two companies. And let me just pull the thread on the space part of it first. As you noted, and you said it nicely without saying I'm getting old, I've been around the space business for a long time, seen a lot of transitions over the years. And we are in a period of dramatic change in terms of space architecture for such a long time or forever throughout my career, we've operated with the notion, which is now becoming an incorrect notion that space is somehow a permissive environment where we don't need to be so much concerned about the actions of adversaries. And today, we know, everybody else has gone to school on what the U.S. has done over so many years. The strategic importance of space is recognized and consequently the vulnerability of space assets is understood. So, we're at the dawn of a dramatic shift in the way that our architecture for our space assets is being assessed. And as you think forward in that regard, it's really going to take the combination of different classes of capabilities to create in space what we've essentially done as a nation with our allies over many areas in the air domain, and the sea domain, and other important domains, which is to create a diversity of capability and a strength in terms of the way that we not only execute our mission, but we defend our assets, and we create a real operating domain. If you look at the Northrop Grumman portfolio space capabilities, we tend to focus on the really big things. Think about us as observatories or in the national security domain, we tend to focus on the very large assets. If you look at the portfolio at Orbital ATK, it's more the smaller, in many case, more agile response capabilities that are going to be core to this future. And just as in these other domains, the answers, the architectures are going to require that it'd be combinations of both of those different types of systems to make it work. So, that's why we're so excited on the space side. In the missiles arena, that's a marketplace we're not really in today in a significant way. And, yet, we see the technology is there progressing quickly. Orbital ATK clearly has a very strong competency in that class of technology and in the manufacturing production of those systems. And as we think about the future, obviously continuing to support what they're doing today with the set of customers they have is going to be important, but we also see opportunities to bring technologies at Northrop Grumman into that mix. And, again, it's a very complementary way of supporting our customers and enabling the U.S. and our allies to continue to advance. So, those are just a couple of the very exciting things we see going on. But I would say more broadly, I'm excited about the full breadth of the Orbital ATK portfolio, and we're looking forward to getting through this process that we're working our way through now, so that we can get on with it and start helping our customers more broadly.
Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thank you, Doug.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good afternoon.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hi, Sam.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hi, Sam.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about technical services just – when I look at the competitive environment, I know last quarter, you talked about Iris. We've seen DOMino, seen some of the secure data network stuff from Homeland Security. I'm trying to understand these businesses where – from the discussion before about how you approach the bids that perhaps you're looking at the business differently that your competitors. Is there is a reason why it seems like you've not been winning as much? And, really, what does it mean for the prospects for that segment's revenues and margins as we look forward?
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Well, thanks, Sam. Let me just kind of give a broad view on that. TS, for us, is a critically important business. It's core to our strategy. It's tightly interlinked with the programmatics across the company both at AS and MS, but above and beyond that, we have customers who are in need of new ideas, the application of new technologies, when it comes to sustainment, when it comes to logistics, when it comes to training, that whole domain. And, yes, to your point, there are parts of that world that have tended towards more commodity types of provision, and as we've talked a little bit about on some of our prior calls, the work we've been doing at TS has been to rebalance the portfolio, so that we are more focused on the higher end of that class of services. And you can see it reflected in the margin rate that sector is delivering. It wasn't that long ago when TS was in the mid-single-digit margin rates, and none of us liked that. We did not see that as reflective of the quality of business that we ought to be able to address with the extraordinary team that we have at TS. And so we've asked them to do what is hard. Basically, they had to trim back the top line, focus on the areas where we're really generating a lot of value, and where it's an appropriate application of the human capital that we have in that business, to also invest in technology for the longer term in that space, and that's what they're doing. So, yes, there will be some of these bids where customers are making decisions to go with more of a commodity type approach that simply are not going to work out for us, and we're fine with that. That's not what we want to do. We'll have to test some of the customers to understand where their decision-making is. I wouldn't be surprised, over time, if that decision-making moves around a little bit, but we're going to continue to focus TS on the part of that market space that is the higher end and fits with our strategy. So, I'm pleased with where we are, pleased with where I see that team going, and wanting to stay on that vector.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Wes, I would just add that while we have lost a couple of, what are viewed as large contracts, we've also won a number of large contracts in TS as well. And some of that contracts that have been lost are IDIQ types where you don't necessarily see the full value ever getting exercised. But TS has had some nice wins this year, and I think you can see that reflected in our third quarter where revenue is down only less than 1%.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Even as we're doing the portfolio shaping.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thank you.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thanks, Sam. We appreciate that question.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.
George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC: Good morning.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hi, George. How are you doing?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hi, George.
George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC: My question is on the EACs, the $56 million. I mean, it says in the Q it's largely performance incentive. Can you talk about how frequently these incentives come around? And then also, year-to-date, EACs are down about 20% even with this $56 million. Is there a different strategy? I mean, you're being a little more aggressive in core margins, so we're getting less EACs, or maybe if you can just describe a little bit what might be going on there as a general question as well? Thanks.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Sure, George. Let me take that one. I would say that, look, AS is a business that's a long cycle business. The programs last – span over multiple years. And relative to our other sectors, they have got a relatively small number of large programs. And so you see incentive recognition or earnings adjustments that are similar to this in nature on a relatively frequent basis, this is not an unusual item, certainly the amount is larger on a single program than we have seen often in the last number of years, but nothing unusual about it. And I would say it again, as you point out, not a large increase in our EAC adjustments this year over last year. And given their restricted nature I can't really say too much about it other than nothing out of the ordinary and the way we manage the business to try to realize as many opportunities and incentives as we can. But to your second part of the question, I think you are getting it right, we are working to try to make sure that we're recognizing our margin on a timely basis. And therefore, more of the margin is moving into kind of the baseline margin rate, I would say, and we're seeing less impact of the total EAC adjustments over and above those baseline margins that we've been recognizing. And we're working to make sure that we continue to do that, that we're – as we're realizing risk reductions, we're reflecting those and as we're able to harvest opportunities that reflect those right into the baseline EACs, and therefore, less large adjustments as we look forward. So that is certainly a part of the strategy and making sure that we're appropriately recognizing our earnings on a timely basis.
George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC: Okay. I might have one quick one for you, Wes. Would you care to comment on the projections on OA that are in the current proxy filing conservative, realistic or...
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: George, I would not have any commentary there. All I would say is, what I said earlier, that the two companies coming together represents some nice revenue synergy opportunities.
George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC: Okay. Thanks.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thank you, George.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.
Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks very much and good afternoon.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hi, Seth.
Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Ken, I just wanted to review pretty quickly here some of the cash dynamics that you talked about on pension funding to the out-years. With regard to the cash in and the cash out, you got a net benefit of, I guess, around $900 million or so this year and with an 8% return, that goes down to a fairly small number in 2020, but with the 12% return you have year-to-date, it's about $350 million positive in 2020. I want to make sure, A, that's that correct and B, the 12% return if you could hang on to that for this year, is that $600 million contribution in 2020, is that pretty much locked in or is that number going to bounce around a lot the next couple of years based on where the returns come in and where the discount rate goes?
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: So, I would tell you, Seth, that first of all, it sounds to me like your math is correct largely. I would say that – I will just remind you that those are pre-tax numbers, so just make sure you're tax effecting them as you have worked through those calculations. In terms of the returns year-to-date, we're really proud of the performance of our investments and trust organization to generate a nice set of returns and certainly while managing risk and managing volatility. And if we're able to hold on to those returns, this year we would expect to project lower CAS and some amount of lower FAS as we look forward. But certainly, market trends or market dislocations out into 2018 or 2019 can certainly impact those contributions. So, we're just giving you the numbers with the best estimates we have today and with the given assumptions as we went through in the prepared remarks. But we do feel that we're pretty confident that as we look forward our CAS recoveries should offset our funding for the next number of years as we project forward.
Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Richard Safran with Buckingham Research.
Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Hey. Good afternoon, Wes, Ken and Steve.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hi, Rich.
Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: How are you?
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Good.
Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Good to hear. So, it's been a really busy year for program wins for Northrop Grumman. We still even have a few pending competitions out there. You mentioned JSTARS Recap previously. So, I'd like to ask you a staffing question here. I want to know if you could discuss how you're thinking about head count. Yesterday, for example, your competition noted they were hiring about 1,000 engineers to support new programs. And in your response if you could also get into any challenges you're facing staffing up. New programs like the B-21 and Ground Based Strategic Deterrent are pretty large development efforts. And just want to know if you think you have sufficient critical mass to support all of these new programs. Thanks.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Yeah. Rich, it's a really good question. And just reflecting on the question that Carter asked a little bit earlier. You have your finger on one of the key things that is an important success factor in our business, and that's the talent equation. We've been doing really well in terms of attracting talent into the company. We grew head count last year, and we will this year despite the shifting demographics that we have across our industry. And it just makes all of us be very focused on the talent side of the equation. But I would say things are going really well. The one thing I have concerns about with respect to talent is the clearance cycle. I'm sure you've heard many talk about that as an ongoing issue in our industry, and not only on the industry side, but also quite frankly on the government side, just the time it takes to get people through the clearance pipeline. But all that said, so far, so good for us. We see a really strong pipeline of talent in our company to apply to all of these new initiatives. And it's just something that we're having to manage very, very closely, pay a lot of attention to, and it's working well for us. So, if you know good talent, send them our way. We're hiring.
Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Sure will. Thanks for that, Wes.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thanks, Rich.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.
Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC: Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. So, Wes, have you stepped back from the MQ-25 program? I guess can you talk about the outlook for unmanned and maybe the opportunity set for Triton?
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Yes. Thanks, Sheila. As I think about the future in unmanned, and we've gotten to the point where we'd like to use the word autonomous because most of the real capability is increasingly autonomous capability where there really isn't somebody sitting on the ground flying the vehicle with a joystick. We're just incredibly excited about it. It is a class of capability that is finding an application across the spectrum whether you're talking about reconnaissance, which has sort of been the traditional application of that class of technology to a whole new set of mission forms. And it's not just in the U.S. as you've heard us discuss on the calls in the past. Our partners around the globe need this technology. The U.S. is working hard to be supportive of our allies' needs, and we have active efforts in this regard in a number of countries around the globe. We are making – we continue to make significant investments internally in continuing to advance the technology. We want to make sure that it's not only mission effective in terms of, if you will, the aerodynamic capabilities of what it's delivering its mission. We also want to make sure that these systems are highly secure. And that they can have the degree of confidence and trust that one would normally apply to a manned aircraft. So, we continue to see this as a great growth area for our company. As I mentioned, and as you referenced, we did make a decision to not bid on MQ-25 just around the particular nature of that final RFP. But, broadly, things are going really well for us. You asked about Triton. That program continues to move forward very well. We're into the stage of discussions on the next LRIP on Triton. So, this is just a good growth opportunity for the company and a demand that I think is going to be increasingly important for our customers.
Stephen C. Movius - Northrop Grumman Corp.: And, Natalia, one more, please.
Operator: And your final question is from the line of Peter Arment with Baird.
Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon, Wes, Ken.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hey, Peter.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hi, Peter.
Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Ken, maybe just a quick one then. Thanks for the color on the notes issuance. Once you folded it in, what's the plan for – I guess maybe update your plans on the deleveraging efforts once hopefully the Orbital deal closes with the new notes.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Yeah. And I appreciate the question, Peter. So, as we look forward from a cash perspective, certainly investing in the business remains the number one priority. We have a nice set of growth opportunities in front of us, and Orbital ATK has a nice set of growth opportunities in front of it as well. So, we are going to be looking to invest in a business, number one. But after that, we will be focused on some amount of deleveraging. We've got some debt coming due in 2018. We've got some debt coming due in 2019, and we will be highly likely refinancing or using some of the debt we raised to refinance their debt, so that will be taken care of at or around closing. And then you can see that we laddered our debt with some near-term maturities as well that we would look at from a deleveraging perspective. That being said, we do expect that together we will be strong generators or a strong generator together of cash flow. And after we invest in the business and do that delevering as planned, we will certainly have sufficient cash leftover to continue our strategy of paying a competitive dividend and looking at some share repurchases. So that's kind of how we're thinking about it. A really nice scenario with strong generation and the ability to really stay focused on the same cash deployment strategy.
Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Thanks.
Stephen C. Movius - Northrop Grumman Corp.: All right. Wes, I'll turn it over to you for final comments.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: All right. Thanks, Steve. I'll just wrap up by again thanking our team for their incredible focus on performance. Everyone's hard work is serving our customers and our shareholders incredibly well. Thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today and for your continuing interest in our company.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's Second Quarter 2017 Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. My name is Kara, and I'll be your operator today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Steve Movius, Treasurer and Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Movius, please proceed.
Stephen C. Movius - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thanks, Kara, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's second quarter 2017 conference call. Before we start, please understand that matters discussed on today's call constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities Laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which are detailed in today's earnings release and our SEC filings. These risk factors may cause actual company results to differ materially. Matters discussed on today's call may also include non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled in our earnings release. I would also note that we have posted an updated company overview to our Investor Relations homepage. On the call today are Wes Bush, our Chairman, CEO and President; and Ken Bedingfield, our CFO. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Wes.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thanks, Steve. Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Our business has continued to deliver solid results. Our entire team remains focused on strengthening our foundation for profitable growth over the long term. And I want to express my appreciation to our team for their great work. We're pleased with our results at the midpoint of the year. Second quarter sales totaled $6.4 billion, a 6% increase over last year's second quarter. Aerospace Systems continues to be the primary growth driver as we ramp up on Manned Aircraft deliveries. Based on our year-to-date sales and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we're increasing our sales guidance to the low $25 billion range versus our prior guidance of approximately $25 billion. Segment operating income also rose in the quarter and our businesses combined to generate an 11.8% segment margin rate. Our year-to-date segment operating margin rate was 11.7% and we continue to expect a mid 11% segment operating margin rate for the full year. Ken will provide additional sector level guidance later in the call. Total operating margin rate was 13.4% for the quarter, and we continue to demonstrate that we can grow operating income through a combination of sales growth and performance as we continue to succeed in bringing on new development work. Second quarter earnings per share rose 11%, reflecting higher sales, higher operating income and a lower share count. Based on the strength of our second quarter and year-to-date results, we're raising our full-year 2017 earnings per share guidance to a range of $12.10 to $12.40. Cash provided by operating activities totaled $507 million in the quarter; and after capital spending of $217 million, free cash flow for the quarter was $290 million. Capital spending during the quarter reflects our investment in support of long-term profitable growth and affordability for our customers. We continue to expect free cash flow for the year will total between $1.8 billion and $2 billion. Our capital deployment strategy calls for investing in the business, managing the balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders. We expect to distribute a healthy percentage for our free cash flow to shareholders after capital expenditures of approximately $900 million. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 550,000 shares, bringing year-to-date repurchases to about 1.5 million shares. Year-to-date, we spent approximately $370 million on share repurchases. We also raised our quarterly dividend 11% to $1 per share, our 14th consecutive annual increase. Year-to-date, we've distributed approximately $700 million to our shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. We had a number of operational and capture highlights during the quarter. The U.S. Air Force announced its selection of SABR for its F-16 radar upgrades. In addition to the international F-16 upgrades currently in production, we are now in the engineering, manufacturing and development phase of the U.S. Air National Guard F-16 upgrade program, which we expect will be followed by an upgrade of 72 AESA radars. SABR extends the operational viability and reliability of the F-16, and provides pilots with 5th generation fighter radar capabilities to counter and defeat increasingly sophisticated threats. We foresee a robust growth opportunity for SABR going forward. We also delivered the first low-rate initial production G/ATOR system to the Marine Corps after the program successfully completed its system acceptance test procedure ahead of schedule. This was the last of the program's required milestones in the production test phase. Five additional systems will be delivered to the Marines under our current contract. Our MQ-8C Fire Scout autonomous helicopter successfully completed its first flight from a littoral combat ship, proving its capability to fly from multiple ship classes. On May 30, our Advanced Battle Management and Launch Control System, an integral part of the Ground-based Midcourse Defense System successfully supported an important intercept of an intercontinental ballistic missile target. We're a strategic partner on this program that provides our nation's defense against long-range ballistic missiles. We were awarded a $169 million contract to build and support a new satellite communication system for Australia, which will enable deployed Australian forces to connect to strategic information networks. The technology is aimed at assisting with a range of Australian Defence Force (sic) [Australian Defence Force] (05:54) operations, including border protection, humanitarian and disaster relief missions. And lastly, after the close of the quarter, we received a follow-on competitive award to provide logistics product support for four Battlefield Airborne Communications Node or BACN aircraft, as well as subsystems and support equipment in support of overseas contingency operations. Looking ahead, we're competing for several important near-term opportunities, including the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent and the Joint STARS Recapitalization Program. On GBSD, we expect two technology maturation and risk reduction contracts will be awarded before the Air Force begins full scale development on the nation's next generation ICBM system. Northrop Grumman has played a critical role on the U.S. Air Force's Intercontinental Ballistic Missile System since its inception. As a trusted partner and technical integrator, we've mastered the complexities of its flight, launch and command and control systems. We look forward to providing an affordable and technically-robust system design that combines our legacy ICBM expertise, core capabilities across multiple domains, and demonstrated ability to deliver secure, resilient integrated systems. On the Joint STARS Recapitalization, we believe our team has the unique experience and capability to execute a low-risk plan for a seamless transition from the legacy platform, on which we are the prime, to a new system based on a smaller, more efficient and more capable platform. Our offering includes the right-sized, high-altitude aircraft, and the highly capable battle management command and control and communication system. We're also competing separately for the AESA radar portion of the program. We believe that we're well-positioned for both competitions. I would mention that in addition to these competitions, we also have the opportunity to address a growing set of restricted programs. As we look ahead, adequate and reliable defense funding will be critical to executing our country's national security missions and maintaining our military superiority. As we address a variety of national security issues, the readiness of our forces, the aging of our strategic deterrent, the increased vulnerability of our space assets, to name just a few, we're encouraged that Congress avoided a year-long continuing resolution and passed the FY 2017 budget, which together with OCO fund, provided needed increases in defense spending. Both the Senate and the House are working on the FY 2018 appropriations and the House Appropriations Committee has completed its markup of the defense bill. We encourage our government leaders to work together to avoid the negative impacts of a long-term continuing resolution in fiscal year 2018, as well as avoiding a triggering of sequestration under the Budget Control Act. We continue to expect a modest upward trend in national security spending for the foreseeable future. Industry must play its part in supporting national security by investing in capacity and capability, and focusing on affordability for our customers to ensure we're delivering value for our customers and the tax payer. This is our focus at Northrop Grumman, and we believe this will create value for our shareholders, customers and our employees. In summary, we're pleased with our results and our outlook at the midpoint of the year. Again, thanks to our team for their continued focus on performance and execution, which supports our strategy to drive profitable growth over the long term. So now, I'll turn the call over to Ken for a more detailed discussion of our results and our guidance. Ken?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thanks, Wes, and good afternoon, everybody. I'd like to add my thanks to our team for a good first half of the year. As compared to last year, 2017 second quarter results included higher sales, higher segment operating income, solid margin rates and higher net FAS/CAS pension adjustment. Segment operating income includes the benefit of the cost claim. These improvements were partially offset by increases in our unallocated corporate expenses and our effective tax rate. These results, along with our lower share count combined to drive a 11% increase in second quarter EPS. Moving on to sector results and guidance, Aerospace Systems sales were up 14% for the quarter and 13% year-to-date. Manned Aircraft was the primary growth driver for both periods as we ramp up on restricted activities and had higher volume for the E-2D program. We also had higher volume in Autonomous Systems and Space. In Autonomous Systems, the ramp-up on Triton and other programs continues to more than offset lower NATO AGS volume as that program moves toward completion. Space was also higher as additional restricted activities are now beginning to offset declining sales in non-restricted programs like Advanced EHF. Based on year-to-date AS sales of approximately $5.9 billion, we are increasing our sales guidance for AS full-year sales to a range of $11.5 billion to $11.7 billion, largely due to our growing development work. Operating income at Aerospace Systems is up for both the quarter and year-to-date with operating margin rates of 10.6% and 10.7%, respectively. The trend versus last year reflects higher development volume for Manned Aircraft. We expect this trend to continue for the rest of the year. For 2017, given our increased sales outlook, we now expect AS operating margin rate will be in the high 10% range versus our prior guidance of approximately 11%. Moving to Mission Systems. Sales rose approximately 3% for both the quarter and year-to-date. Higher sales volume for both periods reflects increased sales for combat avionics as we ramp up on F-35 and SABR, as well as higher volume for communications programs. Operating margin rate was 13.4% in the quarter and 13.2% year-to-date. Operating margin benefited from the cost claim, partially offset by a provision for cost reduction initiatives. Cost claim adjustments are not unusual. In last year's second quarter, our unallocated corporate expenses benefited from the finalization of prior year incurred cost claims. Thus, while some benefit the segment operating income, net of the cost reduction provision, the net impact of this quarter's cost claim is only a modest increase to total operating income. For 2017, we now expect MS revenue will range between $11.1 billion and $11.3 billion versus our prior guidance of low $11 billion. Based on year-to-date results, we are increasing our expectation for MS margin rate. We now expect MS operating margin rate will be approximately 13%, an increase to our prior guidance of mid-to-high 12%. At Technology Services, second quarter sales declined 3%, and year-to-date sales were down 2% due to the completion of several programs as well as lower volume on the KC-10 program. Operating income was up slightly for both the quarter and year-to-date. Based on year-to-date performance, we now expect TS sales will range between $4.5 billion and $4.7 billion with a mid 10% margin rate, a modest increase to our prior guidance of mid $4 billion sales with a margin rate of approximately 10%. Total segment operating income increased 3% for both the quarter and year-to-date, and we continue to expect a mid 11% segment operating margin rate for the year. No change to prior guidance. Total operating margin rate for the quarter was 13.4% and 13.3% year-to-date. Both periods reflect higher net FAS/CAS pension adjustment partially offset by increased unallocated corporate expenses. For the full year, we continue to expect a net FAS/CAS adjustment of $500 million. Keep in mind that estimated CAS won't be finalized until we complete our annual demographic study in the third quarter. In addition, we continue to work on CAS affordability items, particularly, to the extent, they also reduce required funding over the next few years. Our corporate unallocated costs are typically weighted toward the second half of the year. We continue to expect 2017 unallocated corporate expenses of approximately $200 million, with the total operating margin rate in the mid to high 12% range versus our prior guidance of mid 12%. We continue to expect an effective tax rate of about 27.5% and a weighted average share count of approximately 175 million. Just a few comments on our cash results and our expectations for the full year. For the quarter, cash from operations generated $507 million and we spent $217 million on capital expenditures. Free cash flow for the quarter was $290 million. Year-to-date cash trends reflect working capital growth in support of higher sales. We expect working capital to decline in the second half of the year, consistent with our typical pattern. We continue to expect cash flows will be weighted heavily toward the end of the year with free cash flow in the range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion after capital expenditures of approximately $900 million. No change to prior guidance. So, in summary, it was a solid first half, and we look forward to continued strong performance from our team for the remainder of the year. With that, I'll turn it over to Steve to start Q&A.
Stephen C. Movius - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thanks, Ken. As we open the line for the Q&A, I would ask each participants to limit themselves to a single question. You are welcome to return into the queue, if you have additional questions. Kara?
Operator: Your first question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS.
David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC: Afternoon.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hi, David.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hey, David. How are you?
David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC: Yeah. My question is so if I take a look at your guidance, it looks like you're guiding for sequentially flat Q3/Q4 with Q2. Typically, from a seasonal basis, you ramp up in the back half of the year. What is different about this year that we won't see some sequential growth in the back half of the year?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: I would say, if I look at history, we are historically relatively flat in the second half of the year. We're also seeing a tougher compare in the second half as you look at 2016 as we were really starting to grow the business in the second half of 2016 as well. I would say that in terms of the guide itself, we may see some additional volume at the Mission Systems, essentially the legacy ES business on some of their units of delivery sales. But, largely, I don't see this as inconsistent with our historical pattern and relatively consistent with.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: And, David, the one thing I would add, too, on that is – and I mentioned this briefly in my remarks. As we look at the September or October timeframe for the year, there is some uncertainty out there right now on the whole budgetary environment. And I think many in our customer community are of a mind that we are likely to have continuing resolution at the end of the year. And so we've seen a variety of customer behaviors in what will be our fourth quarter. And that would be the first quarter of a new fiscal year. We've seen a variety of customer behaviors over the last number of years as we've dealt with this budget uncertainty. So until we get a little bit better resolution on that, we factor some of that into our thinking as well.
David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC: I appreciate that. Thanks, Wes. A quick follow-up probably for Ken. The 10-Q, it looks like you went through and ran the rev-rec on 2016, and it looks like it was a positive for revenue, but a negative for EBIT. Can you just comment a little bit on that, Ken? Thanks.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Sure. Thanks, David. I would say, we did disclose in the 10-Q the impact – the expected impact upon adoption on the 2016 P&L. You did see that there was higher revenues of about $200 million. That largely relates to the change from units of deliver to cost to cost, as we pull some cost forward on some of the growing units of delivery programs. That would tend to increase the operating margin in 2016. We did have a couple other contracts that had some impact as we looked at 2016 that resulted in a lower margin in 2016 of about $70 million. And I'll just give you an example. On one case we changed the performance obligations of a particular contract to push back some profit prior to 2016. We also had another situation where a change in performance obligations resulted in some margin moving out into the future from 2016. So it's just one of the vagaries of the adoption of the rev-rec standard. I wouldn't take 2016 and assume that when we ultimately adopt in 2018 that it's going to be similar, that was relatively unique impacts of those two particular programs at that point in time. We will certainly keep you updated and be able to provide full information on our year-end call. But definitely don't read that situation into our ultimate adoption in 2018.
David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC: Ken, thanks a lot.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thanks, David.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hey, Jay.
Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Very good afternoon, everyone. Good morning or good afternoon. Wes, I was wondering if you could just spend a few minutes updating us all on your supply chain strategy. Affordability is obviously key for duty at this point. I know you've done quite a few things over the last several years particularly with your centers for excellence. But I was wondering if you've had any further thoughts on the overall strategy and whether there's a greater inclination towards further vertical integration for yourselves and others in the defense world. And I appreciate the thoughts. Thanks.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thanks, Jason. Yeah, it's clearly a really important part of our enterprise. If you just look at the mix of things that we do, I think this year, we'll probably acquire slightly in excess of $10 billion worth of our content from parties outside of our company. And we're proud of our supply chain. We worked hard over a number of years to drive on quality and to make sure that we're driving on performance in our supply chain the same way that we're driving on performance within our company. And at the end of the day, those are the kind of the biggest levers when it comes to making sure that we are getting the outcomes that we need in our programs for our customers. And I've seen great reaction across our supply chain to step up where we've identified some issues in that regard. And also to invest ahead with us as we are investing in our company robustly because of the opportunities that we see and the focus that we have on ensuring we're going to be there for our customers around the globe. Our supply chain has stepped up with us as well. You mentioned a really important aspect of our engagement with our supply chain, and that's affordability. And I want to be clear about our approach on this, because I know there are some different perspectives out there in industry on that equation. From our perspective, affordability is all about getting better designs that are inherently lower cost. It's not about squeezing the death out of our teammates trying to get them into a place where they might be even potentially unviable for the long term. We don't do business that way. We are focused on helping our teammates get to a place where the products they're providing us are inherently more affordable because we're addressing cost. And I think that's a really important perspective, because that's the only thing that's really sustainable over the long term. If you're just squeezing for the sake of a near term deal, you're really not going to help yourself for the long term. So that's been our focus to drive on affordability. The other aspect of it is – and I mentioned this briefly with respect to investment – is we really like being engaged with the most innovative members of our supply chain, those who are bringing their ideas forward, who are pushing us as well in thinking about how we can do things differently. And because we so much appreciate that innovation and the fact that our supply chain members do invest along with us, we always work hard to keep that appropriate balance on how much we do inside versus how much we do outside. And it really is a set of business decisions each time. If we can do something more effectively, that is more affordably, with more innovation outside, that's our first choice. And it makes all the sense in the world to manage an enterprise that way. Because we do participate at the very high end of technological spectrum in the work that we do, there's just inevitably a fair amount of our effort that is internally focused and derives from the internal investments that we make and the capacity and capabilities of our extraordinary team at Northrop Grumman. But even there, over time, we attempt to take a lot of that and place it in the hands of able suppliers that we trust to not only perform on it, but to continuing to invest in it as we go forward. So we do not have in place an overt strategy to drive more vertical integration. That's not the way we think about it. We think about it element-by-element to make sure we're making good business decisions and decisions that will ensure the viability and capability and capacity for serving our customers for the long term.
Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: That's great. Thank you.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thanks, Jason.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.
Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hey, Myles.
Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Can I ask about your mix of business, and in particular your cost-plus development mix of business this year. I think if I've got the numbers right, about 58% of your total sales are in the cost-plus category that's up obviously 7 points or 8 points from where it was a couple of years ago. Is this the peak year for that mix? I know you want to start give 2018 guidance yet, but clearly, one of the concerns in the market is around margins and compression of margins. Do you feel comfortable that this is the peak year for cost-plus development mix, though?
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: So, Myles, let me start on that one, and I'll hand over to Ken. Let me just say, I know you'll hate this kind of answer. It all depends. We are out there aggressively pursuing some businesses, some new business opportunities that are development in nature that we believe represent good, positive, value-creating opportunities for our company. And to the extent that we are successful in capturing more new development work, that mix will continue to go up a bit. And as I've said in the past, I'm delighted to see that happening. We've been quite successful for a while in capturing the development work. And you're exactly right that would put pressure on margin rates. The test that we continue to apply to ourselves is, can we grow both the top and the bottom line? And if we're doing the right things taking on that development work that positions us well as it transitions into production, and we're growing our net income as we do it. That's really the way we're thinking about goodness here. Margin rates are important. We continue to use them in our incentive plans because we like that measure as a measure of goodness. We have a very strong, strong focus on that as we run a downturn environment because that's a really important time to make sure you're completely optimizing yourself around those metrics. But you'll notice that in our incentive plan, we've also added net income growth because as we're looking to ensure that we're building the right foundation for long-term profitable growth, we want to make sure that we're thinking about this equation through that lens. So, again, I apologize for having to tell you it depends, but it depends on how successful we are in capturing some of the new things that are in front of us. But, Ken, if you want to add some color to that?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Yeah. Myles, let me see if I can maybe add a little bit more to that. And I would say that if you look at 2016, it was a 2 points, maybe 3 points higher in terms of mix than 2015. And if you look at 2017, probably a couple points higher from 2016; could be the peak. I think to Wes's point, we've got a number of opportunities in front of us for growth, some of that being fixed price production and some of that being cost-type development work. I would also point out that not all cost-type work is the same. Certainly, in general, fixed price margins are greater than cost-type. But as we take on new programs, there are obviously a number of risks and opportunities that are identified. And the goal there is to burn down the risks and harvest the opportunities and make sure that we're able to drive the margin rate up. So more mature cost-side programs where we've been successful in that regard can be strong generators of margin. We do have some cost-type programs that are still in the process of getting through some of those risks and capturing some of those opportunities, and we'll work diligently to try to maximize every dollar margin out of those. But I think it's a nice place to be where we've got a growing set of opportunities in front of us for both production and development. And ultimately, we will see our mix come back to more historical norms. I'm just not sure I can predict if this is for sure the year for you.
Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. I also thought the rev rec adoption would also help that to some extent in 2018. But thanks for the answer.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thank you, Myles.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein Research.
Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good afternoon.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hi, Doug.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hey, Doug.
Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi. I wanted to ask about Mission Systems. If I exclude the cost claim in the quarter, the margins looked a little weak to us. Can you talk about what's going on there? You referred to the cost reduction effort in Advanced Capabilities, but what's happening there? And how should we think about the mix of that business going forward? And what are kind of the normal margin would be?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Let me start on that one, Doug, and I would say that we certainly had the cost claim, noted that it was partially offset by some provisions for cost reductions as we always look to make sure that we are able to run our businesses as efficiently as possible. I don't see necessarily any major mix changes at MS. I would say that we have seen in the last 18 months or so a bit more in terms of some cost-type work at MS. But I don't see a major change necessarily this quarter. We've talked about some additional space restricted opportunities there that we're performing on and a couple others. But I don't think there's anything particularly huge from a mix perspective. I would say that as we look at that business, we'll work hard to have a strong second half of the year. And we continue to think of that business as one that compares to its peers, and we've talked about kind of the 12% range as a benchmark for that business, and we continue to incentivize the team to perform better, and they have, and we'll certainly work hard to continue to do that in the second half.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: And, Doug, I would just add this is a business that's our highest performer in terms of margin rate. We see a very strong performance trajectory there, and I feel good about seeing that continue. So I don't have any concerns at all on that.
Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Very good. Thank you.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thanks, Doug.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.
George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC: Yes. Just to quickly follow up on Doug's question, if you could tell us, Ken, what the cost reduction provision was there so we could net that out and get a better picture of what the underlying margin actually was in Mission Systems?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Yeah, George, I don't think I want to get down into that level of detail. Obviously, the cost claim impact at MS we discussed was in the range of $30 million, and this was a partial offset to that, and to be honest, I don't have the number in front of me. But we look at MS as performing well, and certainly we'll continue to focus and make sure we maximize that as we look forward.
George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC: But let me ask another one then, can you give us what the overall classified growth was in the quarter? You had mentioned how that was a big contributor.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: I don't think I'd be able to go there, George. I would just say certainly a big contributor, certainly a big contributor at Aerospace, but also a contributor as we look at the MS business as well.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Yeah. And, George, just along those lines, as we go forward, and we see our customer very appropriately become a bit more sensitized to the security environment and the nature of the threat profile that we're addressing, we do see the possibility, and I would say we framed it a little bit more strongly the likelihood that an increasing fraction of our business may become restricted. And as you might imagine, there are some sensitivities to how much information, even when it comes to percentage types of information, that we can discuss along those lines. But we do see our customers increasingly thinking about how they classify their programs.
George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC: Let me ask an easy one that you probably can answer then. The F-35 growth in the quarter and what kind of growth are you (34:26) for the year?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Regarding F-53, George, I would say I don't have the quarter numbers in front of me, but from a full-year perspective, we're looking at AS being relatively flat from an F-35 perspective. Last year had some EMD volumes still in it. We don't see that this year, and the units are largely starting to ramp in 2017. And I'll remind you that certainly the price per unit has been coming down nicely as well. But at Mission Systems, we are looking an F-35 increase and probably $0.25 billion range and that's across all three of its F-35 contracts, the radar, the DAS, and the CNI. So nice growth at MS and we see that trend continuing at both sectors. And to Myles' point probably something that will be impacted by the rev-rec standard as we look at the 2018 and beyond.
George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC: Okay. Thank you very much.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thanks, George.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.
Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks very much and good afternoon. Wes, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the IBCS program. And I know it's not necessarily the biggest turning driver of the company, but it's one that got singled out a little bit in the Authorization Act and – in some of the articles about the development of Patriot and the ability to sell it to foreign customers. What's your feeling on where you guys stand on that program and how much risk there is around it?
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Yeah. I appreciate the questions, Seth. IBCS is a program we've been working with the Army for some time. It addresses some really tough challenging problem for the Army. And so inherently, as the effort has moved forward, the view of the capabilities that's required and the way that it needs to be tested and implemented does evolve a little bit. So we're partnered closely with the Army on this. I see today from the Army a strong conviction of its importance and the need to continue move forward with it. And over time, there are likely variants of this – of interest to our international partners around the globe. And so we are absolutely committed to this program. It's getting many of our best and brightest in the company in terms of its focus. And I believe we're going to see over the longer term, it will take a little while to get all this aligned with where the army and then ultimately the international market will want it to be. But I see over the long term a really nice opportunity here.
Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Thank you.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thanks, Seth.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hi, Howard. If you're there, we can't hear you.
Stephen C. Movius - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Kara, why don't we move on?
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Arment with Baird.
Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Good afternoon, Wes and Ken.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hi, Peter.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hey, Peter.
Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hey. Just on Technology Services, the guidance there for mid 10% margins, you're running north of 11% now implies obviously a high-single digit in the back half of the year. Is there anything unique there? Or is that conservatism or just timing? Maybe just a little more color there on how we're thinking about that.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: So, I would say, Peter, part of this goes to Wes' remarks earlier about the second half of the year in terms of CR and funding and things like that and impacts that could have on the shorter cycle business as well as customer challenges and behaviors and things like that. TS has done a really, really nice job of managing the business in the first half of the year and finding ways to generate some additional margins. And we're continuing to look under every rock to see if we can find more in the second half of the year. But this is a business that performs very well relative to its peer group. And I would say looking at the second half performance, what we're looking at now is not shabby but we'll certainly work hard to outdo it.
Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Got it. Thank you for that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Research.
Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Thanks very much. Good afternoon.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hey, Rob.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hey, Rob, how are you?
Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Great. Thanks. I thought I'd just follow up on your comments about SABR and then some idea from how big this market could be for you over the next few years and how the margins on this might compare to the rest of the division that it's in.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: That's a great question. SABR is specifically right now targeted to the F-16, and as you know, there's a lot of F-16s out there. So the question obviously is how far this goes. How many of those would be aligned on this type of replacement and it's kind of hard to tell. All I could say is if I were an F-16 pilot and I was offered the opportunity to go up against the adversary in an aircraft with a SABR versus an aircraft that didn't have one, I know which one I pick. So we'll have to see how many of the services that are deploying F-16s are aligned on those types of upgrades versus other alternatives of a different aircraft they might be looking at. And obviously, there's a budget (40:29) affordability side of this. So it's a little hard to call right now. I would just say that the adoption that we've seen so far has been great, both domestically – primarily domestically, but the international interest on this is significant. We have a good partnership with Lockheed Martin on this, where both companies are committed to continuing to make the F-16 a very strong capable platform for a long time. And we just have to see where this goes. You also asked about the overall profitability, and like most of these things, volume improves with the profitability on that program over time. And over time, it's certainly our desire that this demonstrates a level of profitability in excess of what MS demonstrates in aggregate. But we need to see the production volumes move in that direction over time.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: I would just add to that, Wes, that we were excited to be awarded the NORTHCOM G1. (41:31) That will certainly help from a volume perspective. We're moving out of the EMD phase, and moved in to production late last year. So that is an exciting phase of the program as we move into full-rate production. And some of the international customers Wes referenced and the NORTHCOM contract are certainly helpful towards that volume ramp that we're looking for, and we look to continue to support Lockheed on future opportunities.
Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC: That's great. Thanks so much.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thank you, Rob.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yes. Thank you very much. So excuse me if you've already answered this, but $54 million was the cost claim, $32 million was at MS. Where was the rest of it? And in addition to the cost reduction at Advanced Cap, were there any kind of one-time items in the Q2?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Cai, let me see if I can run through that. $54 million was the cost claim, $32 million at MS, the rest of it was at the other sectors and across the corporation. I think if you saw the 10-Q, there is a reference to some of the impact at TS, not largely material to any other part of the organization, and to be honest, don't have the numbers in front of me. In terms of the cost reduction initiatives, that is a – I hate to use the term, but a one-time effect that should be behind us, and as we look forward an opportunity to run that particular business in a more efficient manner and generate stronger margins in that regard. Was there any other piece of your question I didn't get to?
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: It wasn't really – And, Cai, you'd asked about it, were there any other big one-time moving things and nothing that was material at all.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: Got it. And then, just a quick one on foreign sales. You have less growth than some of the others. But it looks like the environment has improved for a number of your peers. Are you seeing any pickup in terms of discussion activity or likely sales?
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Yeah, Cai, the international marketplace is robust right now for us and our peers. The question always is when does the discussion and the interest translate into sales. And it takes a little bit longer to get over the hurdle on a few of these things. But we're quite excited about what we see internationally. We're focused around the globe as you know. The three major areas of focus for us are Asia Pacific, Europe and the Middle East. Just from a longer term outlook and in terms of the growth rates, I continue to see Asia Pacific as having the higher long-term growth rate, just given the geopolitical dynamics of that region, the need to significantly enhance the security capabilities and the focus of the governments that – from a partnership perspective and our international partners, the focus of those governments that we see underway. But clearly, Middle East and Europe are going to be quite important as well. We see the NATO countries seriously re-examining their investments. And it's also clear that our allies in the Middle East are taking very seriously their security needs. So I do see this as an important part of the overall global security picture. We're actively engaged in it. And it's just – you have to play these things through on the timeline that they actually materialize.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: And Howard, (sic) [Cai] (45:32) maybe just to add to that, I would say, we did see a growing international sales number in not only the second quarter, but also the first half of the year, both the quarter-to-date and the full year or the six months to-date up about 4% from an international perspective. But to Wes' point, we've got a growing domestic business. We've got a growing international business. And what moves first will determine how it looks forward. But we're excited to again have a nice robust and the first set of opportunities as we look forward.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thanks, Cai.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you very much.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thanks, Cai.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton.
Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC: Hey. Good afternoon, guys.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hey, Pete.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hi, Pete.
Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC: I wanted to follow up on Seth's earlier question, IBCS, because I've seen some of the news there. And I also noted – I think there were some news on AOC 10.2 cancellation in the DOMino cyber loss. And so I started to get a little bit worried about the midterm outlook at MS considering some of that news. And so I'm wondering, Wes, whether or not the percentage of problem for (46:47) MS is on the rise. And also, from a sales perspective, the headwind that maybe AOC and DOMino may provide.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Yeah. As I mentioned on the IBCS, we continue to see a very good long-term outlook on that program. You mentioned the AOC. AOC was the case where the Air Force's request to the Congress for continued funding was not supported, and so the Air Force is regrouping and figuring out what it wants to do in that regard. And I think you also mentioned DOMino was another one of the moving parts. MS has a very broad portfolio. And as you recall, we put together two large sectors to make an even larger sector. So many of the elements of that portfolio are these medium or smaller programs that are going to have puts and takes over the course of a year. But when I stand back and look at all of those puts and takes, I see a nice growth trajectory for MS. You could see it in the quarter. It was growing well, and as we look forward, we continue to see MS as very, very well-positioned and growing nicely. I don't see any particular shift in the percentage of programs that might fit the label, I think you gave a bread. And there's always a mix in the portfolio of things we're having to put more attention on than others. But I think the sector is being managed exceptionally well. We have a team that is both very operationally focused as well as strategically focused. And I'm delighted with the portfolio mix that we have there, and the way that it's been integrated into this new sector. So I feel good about the outlook for MS.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Wes, I'll maybe just add that from a cyber perspective, with respect to the DOMino question, we do view cyber as one of the areas of business that should see some growth, and that's pure cyber business as well as cyber-enabled. And I think we're uniquely positioned from a cyber-enabled perspective, given our expertise both with platforms and systems and cyber. And that's certainly somewhere where we see – we should see some nice growth over the long term.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: No, cyber continues to be a very good positive robust business for us.
Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC: Great. Very helpful. Thanks, guys.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thank you, Pete.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse.
Unknown Speaker: Hi. Good afternoon. This is Joe (49:24) on for Rob.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hi, Joe (49:26).
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hey, Joe (49:27).
Unknown Speaker: Hey. If I could follow up on David's question from earlier on the implied sales targets for the second half of the year specifically in Aerospace Systems. I know you're limited in what you can say about classified, but B-21 funding went up from the mid $700 million level in fiscal 2016 to about $1.4 billion in the fiscal 2017 budget. So we would have expected to see some of that come through in the third quarter and fourth quarter of this year. So can you just help us think about the timing on the ramp in B-21 sales given the ramp in funding there?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: (49:59).
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: We can't say anything about that at all. But just to say that things continue to go well.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Yeah. I won't comment on the B-21 specifically, but if I can just talk about maybe AS at a broad level for a second, I would say that we've seen a nice growth trajectory in AS over last year. It was at 14% this quarter and 13% year-to-date. Again, it's a business that historically flattens out a little bit in the second half of the year and particularly if you think about development work that largely tends to be driven by a large engineering workforce, we do see that we'll have a lower number of work days in the fourth quarter. You've got Thanksgiving. You've got Christmas in there, and that does tend to have an impact on the late year sales. Not a ton of units of delivery work that's driven out of Aerospace where you tend to see maybe some additional units toward the end of the year. They do have a couple of units of delivery contracts F-35 and F-18, but the preponderance of their business is on cost to cost. And so we look at it – there's the possible for some upside there. But as we look at it given the work days, we think the guide is pretty squarely in the middle of the fairway.
Unknown Speaker: Great. Thanks.
Stephen C. Movius - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Kara, I think we have time for one more question.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies.
Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Co.: Thank you very much. Sorry about before. Wes, it's really a risk management question
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Yeah.
Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Co.: And there's two parts to it. Thank you. First, what we've seen recently is that you enter into a number of competitions, and then for a variety of reasons you step aside and let somebody else use price as a way to win or something else, and what I've seen is you'd be very successful where you are. Could you talk about that a little bit, and how you go through the program selection, and how it's integral to your core? And then just to finish the question, the other part is you've got a balance sheet that you've used very successfully over time to leverage earnings, but now you're at a point where – what other tools can you use to enhance earnings growth?
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thanks, Howard. Two great questions and glad your connection worked. Sorry for the earlier issue there. Let me first take on your first question about how we think about the program selection process. It's a process that we have continuously refined over the years. We have a set of areas that we see as those that are most likely to be areas where we can add value to our customers, and that the programs will actually be sustained and supported over the longer term. So we start with that and do a very comprehensive assessment of what it takes to be in a position to really add value and our participation in those programs and sometimes early on that means getting ahead on the investment curve a bit to position ourselves well for that. We interact extensively with our customers through the development of the request for proposals, and give them a very candid feedback both on the capabilities that they're asking to be created as well as the business terms. And sometimes the customers are eager to engage on all of those aspects. And in other cases, and this is not a negative towards the customers, they see the marketplace offering them so many alternatives that they elect to take business terms or pursue business terms that we find unfavorable. And so there are times when even though we believe we're well-positioned technologically and the program is likely going to be supported that we'll decline to bid, because we simply don't see the business terms to be aligned with our view on how we create value over the long term. And we've been selective in that regard. I believe our customers would tell you that we've been very candid with them around that, so that we're not surprising our customers when we make a decision to not pursue something. If it is something that is a re-compete work that we're doing, we're very thoughtful about making sure our customers are not left hanging in anyway. We don't do that to our customers, we stick with them until we transition appropriately. But we work hard to be very transparent with the customer community around the terms that we think will make sense – reasonable sense for us to pursue versus those that don't, and we move on. There's a quite a wide space of opportunity that we're addressing. So there's no sense at all that we've just got to bid something for some reason. And I think I've been clear in the past that we're a company that does not drive itself from a perspective of the top line. We really think about the value creation and the flow-through of how we're generating net income and how that gets converted into cash, and then, ultimately to your second question, how we use that cash in terms of the strength of our balance sheet. And you're right, we've taken a variety of approaches over the last number of years. In capital deployment we've, I think, been good steady payers of a good dividend. We've been very focused on share repurchase as an important tool. But the most important thing that we do for the long term is invest in our business so that we have the opportunity to grow profit and to make sure that we're delivering good value through that profit growth. And that's really our primary focus. And you can see that in our current capital deployment. We are at a bit of an elevated level of capital expenditure because we see those opportunities to drive on affordability and to invest for the opportunities in front of us. We have been, I think, very thoughtful in that regard. We're going to see a continued elevation of our capital probably for the next couple of years in reflection of that opportunity space. We also do look at opportunities outside our company. Over the last few years, there haven't been any significant ones that really met our criteria for deploying capital towards M&A, but it is an area that we continue to look at. I think it's a responsibility on our part to continue to test those opportunities. And should we find one that we have strong conviction that we can apply capital in that direction and grow value, then you should expect us to proceed in that direction. So we look at that full suite of opportunity, but I would just cap it off again by saying our strong desires to put our first dollar towards organic growth opportunities because we see a large number of them. We've had good success in converting those investments into outcomes. And I'm just very proud of how the team drives that discipline. I will tell you that for – back to your first question, some of the things that we've elected not to bid, those recommendations have actually been coming up from the teams. That's not something that just a big corporate decision. It's reflective of the discipline that's embedded within the operations of the company. And I'm really proud of that. So thanks, Howard, thanks for asking that question
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: If I can just add, Wes, to the second part of the question, we talked about the capital and investing in capacity and the capability, but I would also just point out it's beyond the balance sheet, but also down to the rate structure, our ability to invest in R&D for the technology and the capabilities and we invested in that R&D through the downturn and we continue to find ways to enable us to invest as much as we can into R&D. And I think that's a big component of it that – it's a little bit nuanced from the balance sheet side of things, but really that goes to how we manage our rates and our total cost management and really getting to managing every dollar of cost that we run through this business.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Yeah. Absolutely.
Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Co.: Thank you, gentlemen. I get it. Thank you.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thanks, Howard.
Stephen C. Movius - Northrop Grumman Corp.: So, Wes, back over to you for final comments.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: So let me wrap up by again thanking our team for their focus on performance. It's certainly serving our company, our customers, and our shareholders well. Thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today and thanks for your continuing interest in our company.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to Northrop Grumman's First Quarter 2017 Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. My name is Bettina, and I will be your operator today. At this time, all operators are in a listen-only mode. I would now like to turn the call over to Steve Movius, Treasurer and Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Movius, please proceed.
Stephen C. Movius - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thanks, Bettina, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's first quarter 2017 conference call.

On the call today are Wes Bush, our Chairman, CEO and President; and Ken Bedingfield, our CFO. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Wes.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thanks, Steve. Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us. 2017 is off to a strong start and I want to thank our entire team for maintaining our focus on sustainable performance as we continue to strengthen our company's foundation for the long-term profitable growth. All three of our businesses delivered solid results. Sales grew 5%, our segment operating income increased 4% and segment operating margin rate was solid at 11.6%. Our first quarter results demonstrate that we are growing segment operating income through a combination of sales growth and solid program performance. EPS rose 20% in the quarter driven by strong operational results, improved pension expense, beneficial tax items, and a reduction in share count. Net earnings increased 15% and weighted average share count declined 4%. Based on the strength of this quarter's results, we are increasing our full year 2017 earnings per share guidance to a range of $11.80 to $12.10. First quarter cash from operations was the use of funds, which is our typical pattern. Capital spending during the quarter reflects our continued investment in support of long-term profitable growth and affordability for our customers. We repurchased nearly 1 million shares in the first quarter. In total, we distributed approximately $400 million to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Our capital deployment strategy continues to call for investing in the business, managing the balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We had a number of program highlights at Aerospace Systems during the quarter. Triton completed formal lab testing and a successful first flight of an improved software suite, which should enable Triton's early operational capability deployment in the Pacific next year. These flight tests further demonstrate the value of Triton's ISR capabilities for both the U.S. Navy and international customers. We successfully flight tested the MS-177 multi-spectral imaging payload on Global Hawk, further expanding its mission capability. This is the first time this sensor has been flown in a high altitude, long range autonomous aircraft and represents a new benchmark in imaging ISR sensors. This flight test follows last year's successful demonstrations of the SYERS-2 sensor and the optical bar camera and further demonstrates Global Hawk's versatility and effectiveness in fulfilling our nation's high altitude ISR mission. At Mission Systems, our Battlefield Airborne Communications Node, better known as BACN, completed its 10,000th combat mission for the Air Force. BACN continues to provide critical communications capabilities by translating and distributing inventory, video, voice and data to enhance communications and awareness. This is a great example of Northrop Grumman's focus on driving affordable, technologically-sophisticated solutions to meet our customers' needs. We continue to support Lockheed Martin in the upgrade of F-16s with our SABR radar. We're supporting upgrades for international customers with delivery of production SABR radars beginning late last year. In addition, we're working with the U.S. Air Force in support to NORTHCOM Joint Urgent Operational Need for F-16 radar upgrades. At Technology Services, we began work as an integrated subcontractor to Honeywell for the management and operations of Sandia National Laboratories. We have robust domestic and international opportunities across our three sectors. At AS, we're addressing opportunities on the Air Force's Joint STARS Recap, the Navy's MQ-25, new Space programs and a variety of international opportunities for Autonomous Systems. We're also pursuing the Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent program. At MS, we continue to pursue SABR radar opportunities for both the U.S. Air Force and international customers. MS is also competing for the radar program on Joint STARS Recap, as well as for a number of significant restricted opportunities and international programs. At Technology Services, we continue to pursue a range of programs including international opportunities in Australia and the Middle East, as well as sustaining opportunities for our international Global Hawks. As we look ahead, adequate and reliable defense funding will be critical to executing our country's national security missions and maintaining our military superiority. While we are encouraged that increases in defense spending are broadly supported, it's clear that our customers are challenged in executing their national security missions under a prolonged continuing resolution, and with the potential threat of a government shutdown or a debt ceiling breach. Our ability to maintain our nation's military superiority is also threatened when a lack of reliable funding precludes the ramp up or start of critically important programs. Looking beyond the relatively near-term issues of the CR and the debt ceiling, I do think it's important to put into perspective the broader trend lines in our national security community. Simply using the top line budget for DoD discretionary spending including OCO as a proxy, we saw DoD appropriations peak and in 2010 at a then year level of $690 billion. Over the following years we saw a 16% decline in the top line, reaching a level of $580 billion in 2016. It's now clear that our nation needs to address a variety of national security issues, the readiness of our forces, the aging of our strategic deterrent, the dramatically increased vulnerability of our space assets, all compounded by the ever increasing military sophistication, and apparent determination of our potential adversaries. In his budget outline for 2018, the President has put forward an increased DoD budget, including OCO of $639 billion, reflecting the need to address these and other national security issues. The supplemental request for 2017 was also an indication of this focus. Recognizing that any new administration has a limited opportunity to refine the next year budget input only a few months into its time in office, the better indication of the vector of national security investment will be the 2019 budget submittal, which will be the first time a more broadly populated team in the new administration has the ability to put its imprint on a comprehensive approach to addressing the national security challenges. The 2019 budget proposal also will be able to reflect inclusions of critical assessments now underway, such as the Nuclear Posture Review. We all recognize that there are many budget issues to be addressed, but that we need, and that we need, to ensure the broader investments in our country are supported while we tend to these security concerns. But my view is that, absent some dramatic event, we should expect a modest upward trend for the foreseeable future in national security spending. And it's important for industry to play its part in this process by investing in capability and driving on affordability to ensure our customers receive the most value from our nation's investment. We're doing exactly that at our company. And I believe, it will serve our shareholders well for the long-term. Let me wrap up by reiterating that I am pleased with our strong start to the year. This quarter's results support our ongoing strategy of driving performance to enable us to invest in the business for long-term profitable growth and value creation. So, now, I'll turn the call over to Ken, for a more detailed discussion of results and guidance. Ken?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thanks, Wes, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll add my thanks to our team for the strong start to the year. First, first quarter results included higher sales, higher segment operating income and solid margin rates, as well as improvements in net FAS/CAS pension expense and taxes that altogether drove very strong EPS results for the quarter. First, I'll review the sectors' results and sector guidance and then cover pension, taxes and then allocated corporate expenses and their impact on guidance. Aerospace Systems sales were up 13% for the quarter with Manned Aircraft again being the primary growth driver as we ramp up on restricted activities. Two additional F-35 deliveries also contributed to higher Manned Aircraft volume in the quarter. Autonomous Systems volume was up slightly as sales on Triton and several other programs offset declining NATO AGS volume as aircraft production nears completion. Space volume was comparable to the prior year with an underlying trend of growth and our restricted activities largely being offset by declining sales in non-restricted programs like Advanced EHF and the James Webb Space Telescope. Aerospace Systems' first quarter operating margin rate was 10.8% and reflects the increased amount of development volume for Manned Aircraft. For 2017, we continue to expect AS revenue in the low to mid $11 billion range with an operating margin rate of approximately 11%, no change to prior guidance. Moving to Mission Systems, sales rose 2% in the quarter driven by increased sensors and processing volume. The primary volume drivers included all three F-35 sensors as well as JCREW. First quarter operating income was unchanged, operating margin rate was slightly lower at 12.9% and reflects the timing of risk reductions on Advanced Capabilities programs partially offset by improved performance on Cyber and ISR programs. For 2017, we continue to expect MS revenue in the low $11 billion range with a mid to high 12% operating margin rate, no change to prior guidance. At Technology Services, first quarter sales declined 2% due to the completion of several programs and lower volume on KC-10. TS had higher operating income, which reflects improved performance across several programs in Global Logistics and Modernization and System Modernization and Services. For 2017, we continue to expect Technology Services sales in the mid $4 billion range with an operating margin rate of approximately 10%, no change to prior guidance. First quarter segment operating income increased 4% and segment operating margin rate was 11.6% consistent with our guidance. We continue to expect a mid 11% segment operating margin rate for the year, no change from prior guidance. Total operating margin rate for the quarter was 13.3%, largely due improvements in net FAS/CAS pension adjustment. I would note that we are updating our guidance for the net FAS/CAS pension adjustment. We now expect FAS of $460 million versus our prior guidance of $485 million. CAS guidance is unchanged at $960 million, which gives us an updated net FAS/CAS estimate of $500 million for 2017. Also, keep in mind that estimated CAS won't be finalized until we complete our annual demographic study in the third quarter. In addition, we continue to work on CAS affordability items, particularly to the extent they also reduce required funding over the next few years. We continue to expect unallocated corporate spends of $200 million for the year and a total operating margin rate in the mid-12% range, no change to prior guidance. Turning to tax, we updated our 2017 guidance, largely to reflect some Q1 discrete items. In addition to a $47 million benefit related to employee share-based compensation, we recognized a $42 million benefit for the resolution of our 2012 and 2013 federal tax returns, as well as $22 million in additional research credits on prior-year returns. As a result, we are reducing our expected 2017 effective tax rate to approximately 27.5% versus our prior guidance of approximately 29.5%. We continue to expect a weighted average share count of approximately 175 million shares for 2017, which is a reduction of about 3%. Just a few comments on our cash results and our expectations for the full year. Cash from operations and free cash flow were consistent with our typical quarterly pattern. Cash used in operating activities increased to $439 million from $60 million due to increases in trade working capital. We continue to expect cash flows will be heavily weighted toward the second half of the year, with free cash flow ending up in a $1.8 billion to $2 billion range after capital expenditure of approximately $900 million, no change to prior guidance. So in summary, it was a solid start to the year and we look forward to continued strong performance from our team for the remainder of the year. Steve, I think we're ready for Q&A.
Stephen C. Movius - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thanks, Ken. As we open the line for Q&A, I would like each participant to limit themselves to a single question. If you have additional questions, please re-enter the queue. Bettina?
Operator: And your first question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Research.
Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Thank you so much, and good afternoon.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hey, Rob.
Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: I thought – just checking my notes here. I thought maybe we could start off with the export side of things. You mentioned there were a number of opportunities across the three divisions. What's your expectation for the share of exports could be in the orders in the backlog maybe for this year and going forward?
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: So broadly we see quite a few opportunities across the international market place. I took your question to be exports, did I hear you correctly?
Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: That's right.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Oh! Good, good. Let me just kind of walk through each of the sectors and say a little bit about some of the opportunities that we see that we're out aggressively addressing. I think everyone is familiar with the growth in the high altitude long endurance opportunity space for Aerospace Systems and that's really been an interesting market evolving over the last number of years with both Japan and Korea and of course with NATO AGS adopting variance of the Global Hawk platform. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, as we get Triton underway for the Navy, we are seeing increased attention and interest in that platform around the globe really starting with Australia. I think Australia has been at the forefront of engaging with the Navy and thinking broadly about how that type of capability would really support their security missions from Australia. So, I continue to be quite positive on high altitude long endurance as an important capability for our allies. And as we continue to grow the capabilities of that platform, I think that will only continue to be the case. Of course, at AS we're also addressing the fighter aircraft opportunity space that's out there through our partnerships with the Lockheed and with Boeing. F-35 is on the ramp-up on the international side and that represents a really good set of opportunities as well as just continuing opportunity space on F-18. And finally on the Aerospace side, I would also mention the E-2D platform. We have seen so far Japan engage with its – steps forward in that program and reflecting back on our experience with E-2C a number of years ago. We would expect the E-2D to be an attractive international opportunity over the next decade or so. At MS, there are just a whole variety of opportunities ranging from the radar activities that I mentioned in my prepared remarks on SABR to a whole variety of things that include C4I systems and air defense systems around the globe. We're careful obviously about which ones of those we take on. We tend to use more of a model where we've demonstrated the capability in the U.S., for the U.S. services. And then ensure that we're deploying a compatible capability with our allies. But the MS marketplace continues to expand, particularly, as we have over the last year or slightly more now, have been focused on this integrated capability that we've created at MS are bringing together the sensors and the software capabilities that go with it. TS has a variety of capabilities largely associated with sustainment. So, the sustainment of our Global HALE platforms around the globe cause the TS to take on for us. And as we have continued to build up our footprint, our sustainment footprint around the globe, we're taking on some additional platforms through those facilities and capabilities that we both created ourselves in a couple of places, such as in Australia, we've acquired. So the sustainment profile, as we look forward to TS, is an exciting opportunity for us.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: And I'll just add to that, Wes, and say that, Rob, when we think about international sales, it is an important part, and Wes has gone through the details, of our growth opportunities over the long-term. And I would just say that from a 2017 perspective, we expect it to be relatively flat as a percentage of our sales, but I would point out that reflects growth in the international business as the domestic side of the business is growing as well. And I will say that looking at the international sales quarter-over-quarter, first quarter this year to first quarter last year, we did see growth there. So that reflects we are on the path that we expect. I think you had a question about backlog and international, and how it would impact backlog and I don't have that number in front of me. I would just say that, obviously, international deals take longer to close and I'm not sure we want to commit to a number there is going to – it's a longer term pursuit, it takes more time, it will be a growing part of our business and I'd be happy to discuss our ultimate backlog numbers when we get to the end of the year.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Just one other thing I would add as well in the international side. The Department of Defense is very focused on ensuring that their – that the support to our allies is robust when it comes to these capabilities and as we are continuing the strong focus on affordability, I think there is a broad recognition that the opportunity to export from the U.S. off of the existing product lines here, continues to help with affordability on the U.S. based product line. So, it supports the department's objectives in a number of ways, supporting the allies first and foremost, but also in helping to make the production lines themselves more cost effective and affordable for the U.S. customers. So I am delighted to see that strong focus.
Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: That's great. Thank you very much.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thanks, Rob.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt McConnell with RBC Capital.
Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you, good afternoon.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hi, Matt.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hey, Matt.
Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC: So, you've called out the mix impact on Aerospace Systems margins for the quarter and I wonder if you could share how that changes over the balance of the year, but then more importantly into 2018 and 2019?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hey, Matt. I would say that our expectations are that the mix that we are seeing in the first quarter is likely to be relatively consistent across the year. AS is a long cycle business and I think that where we see the mix is probably consistent with where it will be for 2017. For 2018 and beyond, I wouldn't want to comment too much about it because we're only guiding for 2017, but I will say if you think about the long-term business at Aerospace it has a growing complement of both development and production work, the development side, I would say, not only on the Manned Aircraft side but also in Space. And from a production perspective, Wes mentioned F-35, Triton now into production, so growing opportunities on the production side. And long-term, that the mix will be driven by what rate the particular programs move at. And the further we get out, the harder it is to predict on a program by program basis. But for 2017 I would say, we're largely on the path that we expected to be on at this point in the year. And with that being said, we think it supports the guidance that we gave and that's why we're holding on the AS guidance for the year.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: I would just add as we think about the out-years, there is obviously a dependency on the extent to which we're successful in capturing some of the new development work. We are primarily focused our capture activities around new business work that starts off on a cost plus side which often times has some negative pressure on the mix equation. But there are some very important opportunities on the horizon that I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we are competing for and believe represent really good business propositions for our company as we take on that development, and ultimately translate it into production at higher margin rates. So, that will enter into the actual outcomes and the out-years that you had asked about, Matt, the degree to which we are successful in capturing some of these additional business opportunities.
Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay, great. And maybe just a quick follow-up to that point, what's the latest on the MQ-25? And I think requirements have changed a little bit, but what's your expectation for timing and how you are positioned on that program?
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: So the Navy, obviously, has to sort its way through its timing in getting to a decision on releasing an RFP and the rest. We, like a few others, are doing the initial study work to support the Navy in that process. So I wouldn't want to get ahead of the Navy's thought process in getting to an RFP on that. But it's one that, as you know, that general class of capability is an area that we've been very proactive in for some time; whether it's been the work we've been doing broadly in Autonomous Systems or with the general class of capability that goes with the intended missions there. So, it's an important one for our focus and we'll simply have to see how the Navy decides to proceed with an actual procurement on it.
Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay, great. Thank you.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. Good afternoon.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hi, Myles.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hey, Myles.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Just wondering if I could ask on the space side within Aerospace Systems. You've got this transition going on right now where the white space is coming down, the classified is going up and the two things are more or less neutralizing. It sounds like Lockheed is seeing more or less the same thing, they – improves their expectation a little bit on the white world as not being not quite as bad, but they're also thinking about inflection into 2018. And I'm just curious as you think about your space transition between the different growth rates of the white space and the classified space, are you similarly seeing this as a one year phenomena and growth after here?
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: So, Myles, as we look at the unclassified part of our space business, we really see that transition occurring, tipping more in 2019 as we kind of look at the phasing of the programs that the customers have indicated they expect. Whether that might come a little bit earlier is always a possibility depending on what the budgetary profiles turn out to be. But our current thinking is that the unclassified side of our Space business is going to be more like 2019 before we see that inflect. That said, to your point, the other side, the restricted side of our Space business is continuing to do well and is obviously an important part of our overall Space portfolio. And when we look at that total mix, we're quite pleased with what we have in our Space business.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. (27:27)
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: I would just remind you. I would just remind you as well that we do manage it as a single business. We tend to be able to talk more about the non-restricted space than the restricted, which is why it sometimes sounds like it's two businesses. But it is one business. We manage it as one, share resources across the multiple programs, and definitely a business that has long-term growth prospects. And we're excited about what we bring to the opportunities there.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Absolutely.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. I'll stick to one. Thanks.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thanks, Myles.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey. Good afternoon, everybody.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hi, Noah.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hey, Noah.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, just as one quick follow-up to Myles' question there. If it's possible to quantify what the classified is growing versus what the unclassified is shrinking there, that would be helpful to think about the longer-term trajectory. But then, I also wanted to ask on cash flow, just decent amount of focus there today given the quarter, even though it's seasonally weak and the year being sub 100% conversion from net income. But it looks like that is entirely the CapEx increase. So, I guess the question is, how long does it look like that? What do 2018 and 2019 free cash-to-net income conversion and CapEx, specifically, look like?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: So, now, I don't know that I can put a number on the split on the Space business given the nature of those – the nature of those numbers, I guess, I would say. So, not a piece of information I'm able to share on the call. In terms of the cash flow question, I would just say that it is consistent with our quarterly profile to start-off the year with a relatively slow – slow start to the year from a cash perspective and we start to make it up in the second quarter and then really strong second half. And you're right that that in terms of our ability to convert free cash flow – or net income into free cash flow is largely driven by our CapEx investments as we invest for future growth of the business. And I don't know that I could put a number on it or I would want to put a number on it for you today. But I will say that, we've got a growing cash profile. We will be long-term generators of cash. We're focused on profitable growth in the business. We expect to convert that growth into cash from operations and we've talked about a couple more years of investing in an elevated manner from a CapEx perspective. But as a percentage that should start to decrease as we're on our profitable growth trajectory. That's probably about all I can say on that one. So I hope that answers the question.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Do you have visibility into when elevated CapEx ends and – and you're just being cautious in sharing it or is it actually just not certain yet depending on exactly how different programs play out and on exactly what else you win?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: I would say we have pretty good visibility into what we expect the CapEx numbers to be. And I would just say that about as precise as we want to get is it stays elevated for a couple more years.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. And on that Space piece, can you just – forgetting about the classified business? Can you just quantify the decline – pace of decline you're seeing in the unclassified business?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: In the unclassified business, I believe that we're looking somewhere between $100 million and $200 million for the year in terms of a decrease. And I think in the first quarter, the unclassified was probably down in the range of $50 million.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.
Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks very much and good afternoon. Can you tell us where things stand between you and Lockheed on LRIP 11? And they mentioned yesterday, looking to be under a definitized contract by the third quarter. You've got in the past a few LRIPs ahead of them, do you expect that to be the case again or do you expect it to be later on?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Seth, I would just say that we generally don't comment on negotiations that are ongoing with our customers. In terms of any questions on F-35, I'd refer you to Lockheed Martin, but you're right, we continue to work through getting on contract for our pieces of the LRIP 11 of the F-35 program.
Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks, very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolf Research.
Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: Hi, thank you.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hi, Hunter.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hey.
Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: How are you? Yeah, good thanks. So if you think about Aerospace margins, you mentioned obviously some of the mix impact in the quarter. But as you think about some of the classified work and obviously some other major aircraft programs, is there a scenario where we think we could see these margins kind of staying above the 11% number as you look out maybe over a four, five year planning horizon? Or do you expect a little pressure to drop below that, as just we look out over the next couple of years? Thank you very much.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: So, I would say that – I continue to believe that mix is going to be the driver of the margin rates at Aerospace that assumes that we continue our stretch of successful performance and program execution at the sector. And as we look ahead, we do have a growing piece of development work, ultimately that development will transition into production and we have, I think a long run of production work in front of us in terms of F-35, in terms of E-2D, in terms of Triton and other Autonomous Systems. So, I would expect that the mix would start to move back to a more evenly-weighted or more historical level of production versus development. And therefore, I think in the longer term, there probably is some margin upside from the 11% as we see the move to more production in the out-years. But the question is when as well as the level of development content that we continue to bring in, thinking about MQ-25, thinking about GBSD, thinking about next-gen JSTARS. So, a lot to play out between now and 2019, 2020, 2021, and a lot of moving parts, a lot of it is exciting. We'd love to bring in that additional development content and work on that in the coming years as well. So, I wouldn't want to commit to a number, but there is certainly the potential for upside with the amount of production and the run that we see in front of us, and just a question of how well that mix plays out.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Okay. And then, Hunter, let me add. Just let me add from a broader perspective. The thing that we're – we're measuring as we're moving our way along the curve here is how we're really growing segment operating income. And as we demonstrated this quarter, even with a little bit of downward pressure on rate due to mix, we're seeing a nice translation of the top line into the operating income. So, as we think about value creation for the long-term, we're going to make sure that we are looking at it in an integrated manner, not just on individual unique rate metrics in one year. As we think about the ability to bring on these new programs and manage this mix, our test for ourselves will be are we really growing the income with it. And so far, so good.
Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: All right. Thank you both.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thank you, Hunter.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hi, Carter.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hey, Carter.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I just – I want to stick to this whole margin topic again and just sort of get right to the point if I can. I think there is at least some sort of a debate around – as the business, especially in AS, has become more classified, I think it's harder for the market to get a sense of what the underlying risk profile of the programs are. So without kind of asking the margin directionality, maybe Wes, you could tell us about, when you rack and stack the portfolio and the level of maybe risk and opportunity on the flip side, the way we typically think of it in red programs or green programs or whatever. Maybe give us a sense in that kind of qualitative sense of how you think that the portfolio is positioned today maybe versus a year ago if that's a way to get at it.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Yeah. Carter, I think that's a really good question and well framed, and it goes really to the heart of the way that we think about the business pursuits that we elect to go after and then of course, the way we think about executing on the opportunities as we are successful in capturing them. We have a very disciplined process in the company for evaluating each of the business capture opportunities that are out there. And you've seen us over the years and even just recently with the T-X program, make decisions to not go after certain opportunities because of the way we assess that balance of risk and opportunity. And as we have been doing now, over the years, what it has allowed us to do is to move into a place where we feel that we're able to effectively manage that right balance of mitigating risk and realizing opportunities. Each year, as we think about setting our guidance at the beginning of the year, we go through a very thoughtful approach of weighing those for the current portfolio, that factors in the way that we guide at the beginning of each year. And also looking at what we anticipate to be that mix for the opportunities that we're pursuing. So, when I stand back and look at it at kind of an integrated manner, which I think was the thrust of your question. And I think about the mix of the programs that we have today, I think our risk and opportunity balance is kind of where we've been and kind of where we want it to be. And as we are proactively pursuing a number of these other activities, we continue that evaluation process on each and every one of them. And if the final RFP doesn't quite add up to the way we had hoped it might, we don't get too stuck on the idea that we were going to bid something. If it really doesn't add-up, we tend to not pursue it. And I think that's going to continue to be our way of looking at things, so that we can effectively manage this risk and opportunity space. So that we can do, as I mentioned in response to Hunter's question, we can ensure that as we're growing the top line, that we're really achieving what we're after, which is not top line growth, that we're growing the bottom line. That's the focus of the enterprise and you'll only get there if you're effectively managing those risks and realizing the opportunities. So, I feel good about that balance point and it is something that we work hard to manage proactively.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And if you thought about it in terms of the traditional red program framework. Is there any difference in what you see in the portfolio today versus a year ago or two years ago or any color there?
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Yeah. No, over last few years, I think we've kept that in the place that we want it to be. If you turn the clock back on us a decade ago, we were not in a good balance place. We had more red than any of those like to have and it really led us to do what we've done over the last number of years of rebalance the portfolio and be a bit more thoughtful, particularly on the capture side of things. So, I think, we've, over the last number of years, been in a very similar position in terms of that risk and performance profile, the red, yellow, green kind of the assessment. And it's our intention to stay that way.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Awesome. Thanks, Wes.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thank you, Carter.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein Research.
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hi, Doug.
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: One of the things you mentioned earlier about the – sort of budget processes. There has been a big emphasis this year on readiness and we've heard service chiefs talk about the need to deal with readiness before we really deal with end strength, in a sense. If we would have see some moves that way where additions to the budget tended to be more oriented toward readiness than acquisition, what would that look like for Northrop Grumman? In other words, how would you participate in that if that a scenario that's attractive to you, could you address that?
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Yeah. I'll start and then I suspect Ken would have some commentary to add as well. We do participate on the readiness side of things, about a quarter of our revenue is through the O&M accounts and it's probably not the type of work that gets the big headlines like our platforms or our big center systems. But every time there is a concern about readiness that concern typically flows to things like spares and repairs and all other things that keep the force active and operating. So, it is an important part of the way that we support our customers and we see directly the concerns that our customers are expressing with respect to readiness and their messaging, I think, is very, very appropriate given the concerns of the state of much of the equipment and the overall force structure that's out there. So, I do anticipate that that is the first priority; I think that's very appropriate. And on its heels of course is the continued focus on the recapitalization which we obviously – I think it's more clear in looking at our portfolio that we play very directly in the modernization of the forces. But the readiness part of it is something that we are very supportive of in terms of the customer's need and also directly support them in achieving that readiness. Ken, is there anything else you'd want to?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: I think you hit it on that one. Thanks, Wes.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Okay. All right.
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: So if you saw a move in that direction and we saw more readiness spend, is that also something that would hit you in terms of funding and revenues more quickly than you would see somewhat with the longer-term projects?
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Yes. Yeah. Doug, you're right. It's a shorter cycle impact than the modernization activities which are longer cycle. That's correct.
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC: Yes, thank you very much. So could you tell us approximately when you expect decisions on the major domestic opportunities you've mentioned JSTARS, MQ-25, GBSD, and perhaps also [Technical Difficulty] (44:25). And then just from a broader perspective, are you seeing any of these dates slip to the right because of the administration transition? Thank you very much.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Yeah, Cai, I do believe that as we – it's not so much administration transition, it's the budget uncertainty. We've been in a CR now for a while. Hopefully we'll navigate our way through that here in the relative near term. But as we look at 2018, I think there is some concern about how long it will take to actually get a 2018 budget in place. And the reality is those types of uncertainties do impact our customers in terms of their ability to move out with some of their newer acquisition. So, if it's a transition of a study phase, that's not such a big number and internally can be sorted through and figured out. But if it's a launch of a major new program, that sometimes does have a delay that results from these budgetary uncertainties. We've observed this over the last number of years. CR is nothing new. Unfortunately, we've seen a, typically no more than about a quarter of CR. We're in, at this point, one of the longest running CRs that I can remember, which is unfortunate. But it certainly does impact the timing of the customer's ability to get out there and actually make source selection decisions. Most of the – you asked generally about the timing, many of the award dates for the things that we're looking at now are into the 2018 timeframe. It – in many cases, that is just a reflection of the cycle time that it takes to go from an RFP through a whole source selection evaluation process, and then, of course, to get modulated by the budget realities. But most of the primary decision points with the exception of IRIS, which appears to still be holding in the second quarter at...
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: So, it's about mid-year.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Mid-year, yeah. But the others are primarily 2018.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC: Thank you.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thanks, Cai.
Operator: Your next question comes from Howard Rubel with Jefferies.
Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies LLC: Thank you very much. Excuse me.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hi, Howard.
Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies LLC: Thank you. Ken, I know you point out the seasonality of working capital is always tough in the first quarter and some of it is for obvious reasons, comp benefit payments and so on. But, have you looked at trying to solve that, so that is either more level loaded or adjusted it in some other fashion?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thanks for the question, Howard. Yeah, we do look at that and we certainly look at how we can generate our cash on a more consistent, and probably as importantly, on a predictable basis. And I would say we've generally done pretty well from a predictable perspective, but we'll probably leave a little more meat on the bone into the second half of the year than we would like. So we've worked – I'd say we've worked hard to try to pull as much to the left as we can from a cash perspective. You are right that there are some structural challenges in terms of the timing of certain outflows and things like that. But we work hard to make sure that we commit to what we can deliver. We deliver on those commitments, and we try to be as predictable on doing that as we can because we recognize that we're making significant investments in the company, and we've got to generate the cash in order to be able to do that. So, predictability is important and I would say that's probably focus number one. And then focus number two is trying to pull it to the left as much as possible. And some years we do better than that and others, last year was a particularly, I wouldn't say strong start to the year, but it was not as slow as this year, certainly. But we know how to get to where we need to get to. We're comfortable with our $1.8 billion to $2 billion guidance for the year. And certainly, something as we put the first quarter behind us, we'll look at rack and stack of all the receivables and inventory, and figure out how we maximize our working capital between now and the end of the second quarter, and then from there to the end of the year.
Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies LLC: Yeah. I wasn't questioning whether you're going to make the $1.8 billion to $2 billion, it's more of a – is there some process changes or customer factors. But – and then also you pointed out or Wes pointed out that SABR had a notable order and urgent need. And this has been a big challenge for you to get the Air Force to buy it for the F-16, could you talk about how this opens up the aperture for that opportunity, and where do you go from there with it?
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Yeah, Howard, it's Wes. I'll touch that one. SABR has a great capability; it is an incredibly affordable upgrade opportunity on F-16, and the Air Force has, over the years, struggled with the total budget picture of all the things they've had on their plate. Trying to fit it in, and make sure that they're doing the right things for the F-16, not just with the radar but with the rest of the capability on F-16. And the time has come, and they're moving forward with it from a due-on perspective. And I think, it is important as you suggested that this really demonstrates the capability in a broader way, it helps drive the affordability in a broader way. And it is our expectation that we'll see quite a bit of additional international interest on this as a result. So, we're delighted to be working with the Air Force and with Lockheed on this, it's a good partnership all around.
Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies LLC: Thank you.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thanks, Howard.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi.
Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Good afternoon everyone. Thanks for taking...
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hi, Jason.
Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: ...the question here.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hey, Jason.
Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hey, I just wanted to go back to cash flows and the multi-year outlook and maybe ask the question a little bit different way. Ken I knew, and Wes, you both have talked about an elevated CapEx levels going forward. I was wondering though if you could dive into how customer mix might affect working capital going forward. I know that in the international realm advanced payments can be a bit lumpy. And I know you guys are pretty successful in growing international here over the last few years. Just maybe comment on how that's going to impact cash conversion going forward. And then anything you're seeing here on the domestic front with regard to payment terms and negotiations with the DoD customers at here or other agencies inside the federal government? Just anything that would – can change the trajectory, so to speak, of free cash flow conversion would be helpful. Thanks.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Sure. Thanks for the question. I would say first of all let me just address the international piece of the question first. Because as we look at the international growth that we have as a company, it's largely going to be through foreign military sale, those contracts are through the U.S. government and generally do not have significant advance payments on the FMS side. I think that generally when you're dealing with international contracts, if there are concerns and additional risks you try to get more advance payments, from an FMS perspective, the ultimate customer for us is the U.S. government who contracts with the foreign customer and therefore it tends to be a lower cash risk for us, therefore lower advance payment profile. But I think it's a good trade in today's environment. And so I don't see a big slug of international advances as I look out to our international growth opportunities. In terms of customer mix, I wouldn't necessarily say that customer is particularly a driver of the cash flow, contract, lifecycle certainly can be – cost plus contracts tend to be where you collect your cost and bill on them and you get a little bit of a lag depending on how often you bill and how quickly those billings are paid. But there have been some changes to DFAR terms and things like that that can impact some longer cycle programs like aircraft programs and things like that. So, we've got to make sure that we negotiate appropriate terms for those types of programs and that those – that change in costs cut in 2013 or so. And so, we're figuring out a deal with that and working hard to make sure that we manage our receivables and networking capital. And I wouldn't want to put a number on it for the long-term, but I will say just as an indicator, we are seeing a growth profile for 2017. We are projecting that we will have a top line growth; certainly we're projecting to be able to have profitable growth over the long-term as well. And we don't see any significant increase in our networking capital balances between now and in the end of 2017. So, hopefully that's an indicator for you of where we can deliver as we move forward.
Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. Thank you.
Stephen C. Movius - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Bettina, I think we're going to do one more question.
Operator: Okay. And your final question comes from the line of Peter Arment with Baird.
Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yeah, good afternoon, Wes and Ken. Thanks for sneaking me in.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hi, Peter.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hey, Peter.
Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hey. Just kind of a clarification, you called out in Mission Systems on the service side that you had a little bit of lower volume on a couple of different programs within SABR and ISR. Is this just timing related, I know there is no change to the annual guidance for Mission Systems, but anymore color on what was impacting this, whether it was just program sunsetting or just timing?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: As I look at the mix on that, I would say, Peter that we're largely looking at timing issues. I'm not aware of anything structurally or programmatically or any programs that are sunsetting that are driving volume. I would say most of our services volume tends to be in the Technology Services sector. We are seeing some headwinds there in terms of KC-10 volume and things like that. But I don't think there is anything structural from a Mission Systems perspective that would say there is a particular headwind and anything that's there and nothing jumping to my mind in terms of a pressure, but anything that's there I think is just timing.
Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Got it. I appreciate it. Thanks, guys.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: All right.
Stephen C. Movius - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thank you for your time. I'm going to turn the call over to Wes for final comments.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: All right. Thanks, Steve. Well, as I said early in the call, this is a good start to 2017. Our team is focused on supporting our customers and creating value. We're very excited about the opportunities that are in front of us. So we really appreciate all of you joining our call today and thanks for your continuing interest in our company. Thank you.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Northrop Grumman's Fourth Quarter and Year End 2016 Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. My name is Robin and I will be your operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]  I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Steve Movius, Treasurer and Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Movius, please proceed.

Supplemental information, in the form of PowerPoint presentation, is available on our website. Before we start, please understand that matters discussed on today's call constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities laws.

On the call today are Wes Bush, our Chairman, CEO and President; and Ken Bedingfield, our CFO. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Wes.
Wesley Bush : Well, thanks, Steve. Hello everyone, and thanks for joining us. I want to start today by congratulating the entire Northrop Grumman team on 2016’s achievements. We again demonstrated strong performance across the company and continued to create value for our shareholders, customers and for our employees. It was an outstanding year for Northrop Grumman.  As we strengthen the foundation for long-term profitable growth, it’s really encouraging to see that our team remains focused on sustainable performance. In 2016, all three of our sectors posted higher sales while growing or maintaining strong operating income, and generating solid cash flow. 2016 sales rose 4% and we achieved a strong 12% segment operating margin rate and 13% total operating margin rate.  Earnings per share for the year increased 17%, to $12.19 driven by both performance and a lower average share count. Cash generation was also strong. Cash from operations totaled $2.8 billion and after investing in our businesses, free cash flow was approximately $1.9 billion.  During the year, we returned $2.2 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. This includes repurchasing 7.3 million shares for $1.5 billion which help reduce our weighted average diluted share count by approximately 6%.  At year end, $2.7 billion remained on our share repurchase authorization. We increased our dividend by 12.5%, our 13th consecutive increase and we paid $640 million in dividends to our shareholders and our total shareholder return for 2016 was more than 25%.  Our capital deployment strategy continues to call for investing in the business, managing the balance sheet, and returning cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Investing in the business is our first priority. 2016 investments included capital expenditures of $920 million.  Our capital spending reflects increased programmatic requirements and supports our continued focus on cost reduction, affordability and investments to support our long-term growth strategy. We also continued to focus on research and development with over $700 million of internal R&D in 2016, in addition to the R&D investments made by our customers. We are confident these investments help position us to continue creating value for our shareholders and for our customers.  We expect our higher levels of capital investment to continue for a couple more years as we expand our workforce, ramp up on large new programs, complete expenditures related to our centers of excellence, and pursue attractive new business opportunities. We also expect strong cash generation to support our capital deployment strategy. We continue to focus on managing the balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders.  During the fourth quarter, we took advantage of favorable interest rates and issued $750 million of new low cost debt, a portion of which was use to retire high coupon debt. The remaining $550 million reduces interest rate refinancing risk on future maturities and it provides ongoing balance sheet flexibility. While investing for profitable growth is our highest priority for capital deployment, we also intend to continue repurchasing our shares and paying a competitive dividend.  Looking ahead, we began 2017 well positioned to grow sales and generate strong cash flows. Year-end total backlog was $45.3 billion, 26% higher than last year. Strong book-to-bill performance at aerospace systems and mission systems drove that increase. We had several large restricted awards along with awards for F35, Triton, and the UK AWACS program, all of which supported our 2016 backlog growth. We continued to have a rich opportunity set. We were one of four companies awarded a concept development contract for the MQ-25A Stingray unmanned aerial refueling vehicle. Our work on UCAAS provides a strong foundation to compete for this carrier-based program. The RFP for the Joint STARS recapitalization program was released before the end of last year.  We were teamed with GD and L3 to develop an offering that replaces our E-8 Joint STARS with a militarized, business-class aircraft. During the Pre-EMD Phase, we’ve successfully completed the program design review and had two successful demonstrations. The Milestone B Decision is expected in late fiscal year 2017.  We believe we are well qualified to efficiently transition the current capability with minimal impacts to operations given our expertise and battle management command and control and ISR and our experience with legacy platforms such as the E-8 Joint STARS and the E-2 Hawkeye.  I would also note that Mission Systems is competing for the radar component of the Joint STARS recapitalization. The T-X RFP was also released at the end of December, so we now have the final terms of that solicitation to evaluate. We are presently assessing the terms presented by that RFP to determine whether we see an appropriate business opportunity for us to submit a bid.  We are excited about the growing list of domestic and international opportunities across our businesses. This includes the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent program, Triton for Australia, SABR Radar for the US Air Force and several international customers, significant restricted opportunities, and additional international programs being pursued by mission systems and Technology Services in Australia and in the Middle East.  And while we are pleased to see growing support for long needed increases in defense spending, we also recognize and support our customers’ need to reduce cost and get the most value for every taxpayer dollar spent. We’ve made substantial internal investments to drive affordability and support our growing workforce. We believe the best approach to achieving affordability is innovation during the design phase to create inherently more affordable systems, combined with a constant focus to drive down the cost of doing business on both the industry and government efforts associated with defense programs. Our 2017 guidance calls for another year of strong operating performance, as our contract mix continues to shift to a greater percentage of development works. We’ve said for some time that we would welcome this increase in development works, as it provides the foundation for profitable growth and expanding operating income and margin rates over the long-term as development transitions to production. For 2017, we expect sales of approximately $25 billion, with diluted earnings per share of $11.30 to $11.60 and free cash flow of $1.8 billion to $2 billion after capital expenditures of approximately $900 million.  In summary, 2016 was an outstanding year for the company and for our shareholders. Going forward, our priorities remain the same; drive strong, sustainable performance, generate strong cash flow and effectively deploy that cash. And we will continue to optimize our portfolio to ensure our lines of global security priorities. We are committed to build on our solid track record and we look forward to continued value creation for our shareholders, customers and our employees.  So, now I'll turn the call over to Ken for a more detailed discussion of our results and our guidance. Ken?
Kenneth Bedingfield: Thanks, Wes, and good afternoon everyone. I’ll add my thanks to our team for their outstanding efforts this year. Today I’ll provide a little more detail on our 2016 results, and our 2017 outlook. We are very pleased with our 2016 sales of $24.5 billion and our strong operating income and cash generation driven by all three sectors.  Turning to the sectors, Aerospace System sales were up 20% for the quarter and 9% for the year. Manned Aircraft was the primary driver of sales growth as we ramped up on restricted work as well as higher volume on the E-2D and F-35 programs. Aerospace Systems’ 2016 operating margin rate was 11.4%. This reflected 40 basis points for a gain from the sale of a property in the fourth quarter, which we had contemplated in our guidance.  For 2017, we expect AS revenue in the low to mid-$11 billion, due to growth on restricted programs and Triton, which together more than offset declines in non-restricted space and the NATO AGS program. We expect F-35 volume will be comparable to 2016. Just a reminder that the F-35 will continue to be on units-of-delivery accounting in 2017 before adoption of the new revenue recognition standard in 2018. We expect the AS operating margin rate to be approximately 11% driven by the changing contract mix to more development contracts. 2017 AS margin rate guidance also reflects a B-21 booking rate approach that we believe is appropriate for the early stages of this incentive-based development contract. As a reminder, we will review our booking rate overtime as we work to retire risk and realize incentive fee milestones. In 2017, cost-type development work is growing at a faster rate than higher margin production work. This growing mix differential will persist until the F-35 and other production programs including international ramp up in 2018. Moving to Mission Systems, sales rose 9% in the quarter, and 2% for the year. 2016 operating margin rate was unchanged from the prior year at 13.2%. For 2017, we expect MS revenue in the low $11 billion range with a mid to high 12% operating margin rate. Primary revenue growth drivers include continued ramp up on F-35, partially offset by a decline on EA-18G. Looking at technology services 2016 sales were comparable to the prior year at $4.8 billion. 2016 operating margin rate of 10.6% was also comparable to the prior year. For 2017, we expect Technology Services sales will be in the mid-$4 billion range, with an operating margin rate of approximately 10%. Lower revenue in 2017 is largely due to an expected decline of approximately $250 million on the KC-10 program.  As we roll all that up, we expect 2017 segment operating margin rate in the mid-11% range, reflecting, as I’ve mentioned previously, our portfolio of changing mix with more development work. We expect our total operating margin rate will be in the mid-12% range. That's after unallocated corporate expense of about $200 million and net t FAS/CAS pension adjustment of $475 million. Moving on to pension, 2017 net t FAS/CAS adjustment is based on a 4.19% discount rate, 8% long-term rate of return on plan assets and 2016 net plan asset returns of about 7.7% after expenses including PBGC premiums. The 34% decline in our discount rate reflects the higher yield on treasuries at year end. However, this was more than offset by the credit spread contraction between treasuries and corporate. 2016 FAS is estimated at $485 million and CAS at $960 million. Keep in mind that estimated CAS won't be finalized until the completion of our annual demographic study in the third quarter.  Let me just go back there. On the decline, the basis point, it was a 34 basis point decline in our discount rate. I apologize, as I said percent, 34 basis points. For 2018, and 2019, we currently expect CAS expense of approximately $1 billion. For 2018 and 2019 FAS, we currently expect $400 million and $350 million respectively.  And for your modeling purposes, holding all other assumptions constant, a 25 basis point change in the discount rate changes FAS expense by approximately $70 million and a 100 basis point change in plan asset returns versus our expected 8% changes FAS expense by approximately $50 million. CAS is significantly less sensitive to changes in discount rate and plan asset returns.  In aggregate, on a GAAP basis, the year-end funded status of our plans were slightly below last year at 80%. Our funded status reflects the impact of discount rate assumptions, a discretionary pension contribution in 2015 and actual plan asset returns. Our qualified plans also remain well funded at 84%. Our required contributions remain minimal for the next few years, less than $100 million in 2017 and 2018 and increasing to about $400 million in 2019, again, based on our current assumptions. Beyond 2019, we continue to expect required funding will be lower than CAS recoveries. Turning to tax. We expect the tax rate of approximately 29.5% in 2017. Our guidance includes an estimated first quarter tax benefit for ASU 2006-09, the accounting change for excess tax benefits on employee share-based payments. Our 2017 earnings per share guidance of $11.30 to $11.60 assumes weighted average diluted shares of approximately 175 million, a share count reduction of about 3%. Just a few comments on our cash results and our expectations for 2017. With nearly $1.9 billion in free cash flow, we delivered strong cash results in 2016 while investing for the future with $920 million in CapEx and we expect 2017 free cash flow will range between $1.8 billion to $2 billion. We also expect our cash generation will be heavily weighted toward the second half of the year as is our typical pattern. Also during the fourth quarter, we did repatriate about $472 million from certain foreign subsidiaries. So now we have more flexibility in using that cash. We ended the year with a cash balance of $2.5 billion, nearly all of it in the US.  Year-end cash balance includes $550 million remaining from the November debt offering of $750 million, 3.2% ten year notes after the redemption of the high coupon debt. So, in summary, we had an outstanding year and we look forward to continued strong performance from our team in 2017. Steve, I think we are ready for Q&A.
Stephen Movius: Thanks, Ken. As we open the line for Q&A, I would like each participant to limit themselves to a single one part question, so we can hopefully get everybody who wants to have a question to ask it. Robin? 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays.
Carter Copeland : Hey, good morning, gentlemen.
Wesley Bush : Hi, Carter.
Kenneth Bedingfield: Hey Carter.
Carter Copeland : Just a question on the Aerospace growth in the quarter, just to clarify the disclosure, were the increases in manned E-2 and F-35 contributors in that order, and if we were to think about the lead times you've referenced before on the F-35 relative to Lockheed, they are talking about a 40% increase in deliveries next year.  Is that the kind of order of magnitude of increase you saw in the quarter on that program? Just trying to figure out, it's a lot of revenue delta, almost $500 million in the quarter. How should we think about that splitting between those pieces? Thank you.
Kenneth Bedingfield: Sure Carter. I’ll just comment, I guess that, in terms of the magnitude of revenue growth in the fourth quarter at AS restricted was clearly the largest driver of the growth and with the E2 and F-35 following at from a military aircraft perspective and certainly nice contribution from autonomous systems with Triton and Global Hawk as well. Specifically, on F-35, I would say that, I’ll just remind you that our accounting model is different from Lockheed. So I would not necessarily look at their change and project it to what you see for us. We are looking at from an AS perspective as well as MS remaining on a unit-of-delivery basis for one more year.  We are working our way through for the most part production on lots that were relatively consistent in terms of number of units and the units-of-delivery increase as we see increases in the quantities for 9 and 10 and going forward will, would on a units-of-delivery basis flow through in 2018 although by that point will be on to the new rev rec standard, we'll be on to cost-to-cost of Lockheed and I think that’s when you’ll really see us start to ramp from an F-35 perspective.
Carter Copeland : Yes. I am really just looking at the units that they are calling out. They had said 66 deliveries versus 46 or 47, I think. So, if you are on units-of-delivery that would imply that the F-35, given the lead times you've previously referenced would have been greater than the growth rate you saw in the segment. I was just trying to clarify if that still made sense from a units-of-delivery standpoint.
Kenneth Bedingfield: Yes, just keep in mind; our units are when we deliver it to them versus their units when they deliver it to the air force. So we are well ahead of them in terms of the units-of-delivery. I don’t have the exact numbers in front of me in terms of what units were delivered this year versus last year.  There was a slight uptick, but I’ll remind you that we’ve been driving the price down as well as we’ve been moving through lot-by-lot negotiations. Certainly happy to have you follow up with Steve on any more details. 
Carter Copeland : Great. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Arment from Baird. 
Peter Arment : Yes, good afternoon, Wes, Ken, Steve. 
Kenneth Bedingfield: Hey.
Peter Arment : Wes, I guess, my question is really around, I guess, the budgets and kind of overall. Lot of focus on the readiness of the new administration, but a lot of people don't always tag Northrop Grumman as kind of being the readiness play. Just maybe give your high level thoughts on just if there is any impact to you or how you are viewing that.
Wesley Bush : So, just in terms of the broader budget view, clearly readiness is a heck of a problem right now. The silliness of the sequester, the Budget Control Act, however you want to reference it has gone on way too long and with this, it clearly needs to get fixed. It’s impacting both readiness and the ability of the nation to recapitalize our military force structure. And to answer your question correctly, we do benefit from the budgets on readiness while that may not be the way lot of folks think about us.  We do a lot of that type of work across the company and so, we are supporting our customers in a very broad way on the readiness side. But I think it’s important to continue to emphasize the need to deal both with the readiness side and with the recapitalization side. We have such an aging infrastructure from a national security perspective that we have to get on with it.  And I am just delighted to see with the new administration and in particular General Mattis, and others who are taking a strong lead and communicating the imperatives from a national security perspective are strong support for getting this done as well as the support that we are seeing forward on the hill. 
Wesley Bush : Appreciate the color. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.
Seth Seifman : Thanks very much and good morning everyone.
Wesley Bush : Hi, Seth.
Seth Seifman : Hi. Ken, I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about some of the margin drivers in the guidance? I guess if you look at Aerospace and you highlighted some of the mix headwinds there, but, if you take out the gain that you had in the fourth quarter, it looks like you could be keeping Aerospace margins fairly flat next year and you guys actually usually have a little room for upside.  And so, potentially, even a bit higher with those headwinds. Whereas in Technology Services, I would have thought maybe with exiting a lower margin contract maybe some opportunity to stay flatter or be up and then it looks like Mission Systems is where there actually is a little bit of headwind on an underlying basis. So, maybe if you could just talk qualitatively about those? 
Kenneth Bedingfield: Sure. Maybe I'll take your question, Seth, sector-by-sector and I'll just start at AS. And from a margin perspective, I really think that as we look at AS, the item that's impacting our margin guidance for 2017 really is about the additional development work that we are taking on. It's really about the changing mix that we are seeing. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we expect that that will have an impact on AS until some of the more mature production programs start to ramp and we expect that – we expect to see that in 2018 and beyond.  If you want to think of F-35 and then including international F-35 opportunity and other international opportunities including Global Hawk and other autonomous systems. So AS, I would really characterize as being, again, driven by the mix change with the additional development content.  From an MS perspective, I think we've seen strong performance out of that team. I think we're guiding a strong margin rate for MS for 2017. They've also got some mix changes. We've been seeing an additional volume out of their restricted space business in particular. So that will have some impact on MS. But we have seen strong performance out of that sector in 2016.  And then from a TS perspective, we do see that TS will have some lower volume out of the KC10 program, which was not a great margin contributor for us. But we are working with TS in terms of reshaping that portfolio a bit and getting it where we want it to be from a 2017 and beyond perspective.  We see that having a little bit of impact on margins in 2017, but we look to work with that sector for continued strong performance and I'll say industry-leading performance from that business against its peers. 
Wesley Bush : And Seth, it's Wes. I would just add, Ken did a great job of walking you through kind of the puts and takes in the individual sectors. Just from a broad view, just as we do each year at the beginning of the year, we think hard about the balance of risk and opportunities and the challenge to our team is to manage those risks down and to realize the opportunities.  We'll see how we do as we get into this year. I've been pleased with the approach that our team has used over the last number of years to effectively drive on that balance of risk and opportunities. So it's kind of where we are again this year. 
Seth Seifman : Great. Thank you very much. 
Wesley Bush : Thank you, Seth.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. 
Noah Poponak : Hey, good afternoon everyone. 
Wesley Bush : Hi, Noah. 
Kenneth Bedingfield: Hey, Noah. 
Noah Poponak : So, I guess, my question is, how does a relatively large defense contractor grow revenue 12% organically in a quarter where total DoD investment is flat to slightly down? And then how does that same company that's exiting at a year at 12 step down to 2 when it's a pretty long cycle business a and the comparisons are reasonable in that next year? 
Wesley Bush : Noah, I think as you know it all comes down to programattics and our business in a very real sense is, when we're talking about top line, I think is pest viewed through that lens. It's programattics and its portfolio. And if you look at the combination of AS and MS, together those two sectors are enjoying nice growth and I think we'll continue to he see that as we get into the course of this year.  As we talked about last year on a couple of our calls, we are going through a rebalancing of the portfolio in Technology Services. And that rebalancing put some downward pressure on their growth for this year and you have to put that in the overall math of the whole company. So that's really the flavor I would give in that – from the perspective of the top-line is that it's the way the parts come together against the programattics and the portfolio work that we're doing.  And again, all of that is aligned around the idea of ensuring that we've got the right portfolio for the longer term that we are going to be best matched into the needs of our customers. So we think we've got that calibrated about right, about where we want it to be. 
Kenneth Bedingfield: Wes, I’ll just add that, if you look quarter-over-quarter, Q4 of 2016-to-Q4 of 2015, you will see a 12% increase, but I would just caution you and remind you that fourth quarter of 2015 was our low point in terms of quarterly sales last year and given that we are a long cycle business, I would just think about it with a little more of a longer-term view in terms of where we've been and where we are going and certainly reflecting Wes' comments as we look forward. 
Noah Poponak : Yes, now, that makes sense and is helpful. The TS headwinds make sense, I was just - the segment is about half the size of the other two and even if I go to the mid-4s you are pointing to, it looks like the average of even AS and MS isn't far from the implied growth rate of the total. But that's okay. Can you remind us the - or can you size the headwind from the KC loss that you referred to in TS? 
Kenneth Bedingfield: Yes, I think the rough order of magnitude we see that as being about a $250 million revenue headwind for 2017. 
Noah Poponak : Okay. Great. Thank you. 
Wesley Bush : Thanks, Noah. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. 
Myles Walton : Thanks. Good afternoon. 
Wesley Bush : Good afternoon, Myles. 
Kenneth Bedingfield: Hey, Myles.
Myles Walton : Wes, your opening remarks, you commented on some of the opportunities that were in the trade space. 
Wesley Bush : Yes.
Myles Walton : One of which was T-X obviously. The final RFP come out it sounded like you reviewing it as if you hadn't determined that it was a good business to be bidding into and yet you've obviously clean sheeted your own design. You’ve spent your hard earned cash and effort to develop these prototypes. What is it that's holding you back from thinking you definitely would bid it? 
Wesley Bush : So Myles, let me be clear. We have not reached a conclusion on that. My statements were more a reflection of the discipline that we have in our company of really looking at each of these opportunities through the cold, hard lens of what's the RFP really tell you and what will the business case looks like.  While it's interesting that we have made some investments along the lines of supporting this program. Investments which by the way tend to have broader applicability. We need to be thoughtful as we are on every single one of these RFP activities. We need to be very thoughtful about, okay, what's it mean going forward. And that's really the business case we look at. And you've seen us make a variety of decisions over the years.  Once we see the actual terms and it’s that discipline that I think keeps us in the right place. So that we don't walk ourselves into a decision to do something just because we've being doing it. They all have to be good business opportunities for us. So my remarks were intended to simply reflect that that's where we are in that process having just recently we gotten the final terms of the RFP. 
Myles Walton : But there was no change in the final versus the prior to in terms of your thinking, this is just the due course of evaluating if it was a good business or not. 
Wesley Bush : That's our process. 
Myles Walton : Okay. Thanks. 
Wesley Bush : Thank you, Myles. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Finbar Sheehy from Bernstein Research. 
Finbar Sheehy : Good morning. 
Kenneth Bedingfield: Good morning. Hey, Finbar. 
Finbar Sheehy : I wonder if you could take us back to TS for a moment. I know you've talked about restructuring that portfolio and even before that the revenues have been down in the last three years, backlog has been declining, margins have been doing pretty well.  Are you at a point where you have a sense for what the bottom in revenues is the base from what you are going to be rebuilding after restructuring and when that might happen? And what the starting point for margins would be? And then as you grow it, do you expect to be able to grow margins at the same time? Or would the growth be at lower margin business in the first or in the sense of just because they are starting as new activities? 
Kenneth Bedingfield: Sure, sure. Appreciate the question and let me just maybe clarify. I hate to think of what we are working on from a portfolio perspective at TS with the word restructuring. So, I would say more so about aligning the portfolio with where we see our capabilities and the customer needs. As I think about TS, the revenue has been declining. Yes, I would agree with that. But it's been in a declining budgetary environment.  We see it continue to decline in 2017 as contemplated in our guidance. But largely driven by again the activities realigning the portfolio, as well as the impact of the KC10 revenues coming out. But also the impact of some decisions that we have made about not pursuing some business that's lower margin and not differentiated. And I think you are seeing that through the higher margin rate that that business delivers as compared to its peers.  My thought on the portfolio realignment is we get that through the system largely in 2017 and my expectation is that 2017 – and I am not going to provide sales guidance beyond then, but 2017 would likely be where we'd see the impact of restructuring and we ought to see a different trajectory as we move forward from there. 
Stephen Movius: We are ready for the next question, Robin. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. 
Sam Pearlstein: Good afternoon. 
Wesley Bush : Good afternoon, Sam. 
Sam Pearlstein: Just thinking back to the AS margin, I know there was the gain this quarter, but just thinking about a little bit of a decline in 2017. I am just trying to think about as some of that restricted work continues beyond 2017, you mentioned some of the ramp up of the other programs, but F35 converts over to the percentage of completion. So I am just trying to think about the trajectory of AS margins, do you see that staying flat? Going down, going up beyond 2017? 
Kenneth Bedingfield: Sam, I wouldn't want to provide any guidance beyond 2017. What I would probably reference you to is, if you think about the comments we made in our prepared remarks, again, we see that our 2017 margin rate is largely impacted by the mix with that mix being more heavily weighted to development.  And I think to Wes' point, we look forward to some of that development work transitioning into production and starting to generate the additional margins and additional operating income out of those. But I couldn't comment for you on any specifics on numbers beyond 2017. 
Wesley Bush : And Sam, let me just add, it's Wes, let me just add. One of the things that I wanted to be clear about in my introductory remarks is, we see quite a nice array of new opportunities in front us and we are pursuing quite a few of those. We are making a lot of decisions in the company around how we pursue those and which ones we are pursuing. Nevertheless, our hope is that we are going to be successful on a number of them.  And in doing so, we'd be bringing some more development content in. So, this question of mix over time is one that is somewhat dependent on our success and what we capture and when we capture it. And as I've said a number of times, I'll be delighted to be successful with good business cases, capturing a little bit more development mix in this period of time when our nation is working to get the recapitalization initiatives under way.  And if that means I've got a little bit more pressure on margin rate for some period of time, I think that's the right thing to do for the long-term of the enterprise. And that's how we are thinking about this decision space in front of us.  So, as Ken said, we aren't providing some guidance out into 2018 in part because, we'll have to see where we are successful on some of these new development initiatives and also the rate at which our customers are able to support financially the ramp-ups on production. So those are sort of the variables that are out there that I think go to the question that you're asking. 
Sam Pearlstein: Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you. 
Wesley Bush : Thank you, Sam. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. 
George Shapiro: Yes, I want to pursue a couple of things. One, Wes, if I look at your earnings guidance that you provided this time last year, it was 990 to 1020 and we all know you did 1219 for the year. Now maybe about half of that was due to tax benefits and stuff that won't recur, but a good part of the rest was due to lower shares and operations.  So my question is, what's different this year that we shouldn't assume at least some steady improvement in the EPS, especially, since you look at the Aerospace backlog, it's up 50%. So I would think that per Noah's question, that you'd have faster growth in Aerospace sales than what you're providing. 
Wesley Bush : Yes, George, I do appreciate that question and I appreciate you kind of recounting the success that we had last year in really driving on performance and the outcomes of our approach to capital deployment. And I would just say that, we are a company that really does take a careful look in assessing both, I mentioned this a little bit earlier, assessing both the risk and the opportunities that we see at the start of each year as we look into the year and that's the way we think about our financial equation.  And it's also the way that we structure the framework for the team and the work that the team has in front of them across this rather large portfolio of programs that we have to really drive on performance. So how we come out, depends on how well we do on executing. And we have a view of it today that we think is the right balance and that's the basis of our guidance.  The right balance between those risks and opportunities. But we sure are going to be working hard as we go through the year to realize opportunities and manage those risks. So we'll have to see how we come out this year. I've been really pleased as I said in my remarks with how the team performed in 2016 and to be honest with the number of years prior to 2016. I think there is a growing execution discipline within the organization. But we have to actually see the outcomes. So that's kind of the framework that we're using and I think it is the right place for us to be at this point in the year. Ken, is there anything you would add to that? 
Kenneth Bedingfield: No, I think that was great, Wes. Let me add to it. George, you commented on a couple things, one of which is tax and I agree that tax was a significant contributor to the increased EPS in 2016 versus our initial guide. You referenced shares as well. Actually, think from a share count perspective, we came awfully darn close to what our guide was. So I don't see shares as being – share count as being a significant contributor.  But I will remind you as well that corporate unallocated is an area where we had some success in 2016 in reducing our corporate unallocated expenses that included some one-off type items including settlements including some state tax refunds that the benefit of those we saw in 2016 and not clear that they would recur as we look at 2017 and forward. 
George Shapiro: Let me follow up, how about, Wes, on the sales guide for Aerospace? I mean, you gave for the first time year-over-year backlog up 50% in Aerospace. I mean, is there a way to look at the duration as to how fast that actually rolls into revenues, because on the surface it would seem that the Aerospace sales guide would be low. 
Wesley Bush : Well, George, I would say, we were really pleased with the captures in Aerospace last year. It demonstrated what we've been working to do to really position ourselves from both an innovation and good ideas perspective with our customers as well as from an affordability perspective.  And I would say our success in capture last year had as much or more to do with affordability as it did with the inherent technology and capabilities of our offerings. So I was just really pleased to see those outcomes.  With respect to this translation of backlog into annual sales, again, there is this wide variability across the programs. We are seeing in Aerospace and actually it's rippling into some other areas a little bit more of a longer cycle view on some of these awards. So I can't give you the exact translation factor.  But, I would just say we are going to have to be thoughtful and mindful of how to think about awards translation into annual sales and that's gone into the way that we are thinking about our guidance. 
George Shapiro: Okay. Thanks very much.
Wesley Bush : Thank you, George. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi. 
Jason Gursky : Hey, good afternoon everyone. 
Wesley Bush : Afternoon, Jason. 
Kenneth Bedingfield: Hey, Jason. 
Jason Gursky : Hey, Wes, I was wondering if you wouldn't mind just commenting on recompetes that you face, maybe particularly in the services related businesses and talk about whether when these contracts get recompeted either you're the incumbent or you are challenging to get in on some new businesses not yours. Whether the funding levels have begun to stabilize in those recompletes?  Or whether we are continuing to see funding levels decline? And then, secondarily to that, just competitive environment around those recompetes, whether things have changed in any significant way over the last 12 or 18 months? Thanks. 
Wesley Bush : Well, thanks for the question and let me kind of give a flavor of it and Ken can perhaps give a little more color or details to it. But your question actually - particularly because you directed it towards Technology Services, goes to a lot of what we are thinking our way through on this portfolio reshaping. In the areas where we see a good, sustainable differentiated business for the long-term, we are happy to engage in the recompetes if they are well funded, if we see that the customer commitment to them to be something that merits, the natural investment you put into a recompete.  There have been a few over the last couple years and there is likely to be some on a go-forward basis where we see a recompete really as a transition opportunity for us to help the customer transition to another party. I've said this before and we're serious about it. We will never leave a customer in the lurch.  If they have invested in us a responsibility to get something done, we are going to get it done and if it means doing it for a bit longer than we might have otherwise liked, we'll keep doing it until they are ready to make a transition.  But the recompetes tend to offer those opportunities for those transitions and we look very carefully at each one of them, both in terms of as you mentioned the funding and the funding stability that goes into it, as wells as what we read to be the customers’ view of its need for a differentiated capability. So that's kind of the flavor of how we think about it.  Ken, would you want to offer some more color on that. 
Kenneth Bedingfield: Yes, that's great. Thanks, Wes. And Jason, I would just say that, as we look at our recompete exposure for 2017, we don't see it as material to our results one way or the other successful or unsuccessful on those recompetes and actually the largest recompete opportunity that we see is at Mission Systems and that would be what you might be familiar with as the JRDC program and we've been the prime on that for a number of years.  There are some other recompetes at MS and a few at TS. But I would tell you that again, we don't see it as being significant in terms of our financial results for 2017. 
Jason Gursky : Great. Thanks. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company. 
Cai von Rumohr: Yes, thank you very much. So, impressive cash flow guidance for 2017, given the very heavy level of CapEx. Can you give us some more color on how you can get there, given that high level of CapEx? And then looking forward, you had indicated that we are going to have some more high level CapEx looking forward. About how long do we stay at this elevated level? And can you sustain the cash flow over this period? 
Kenneth Bedingfield: So let me - I'll start, Cai. First of all, thanks for your comment and question. From a cash flow perspective, as we look at 2017, we do see it as being a strong year of cash generation. We are going to generate significant cash from operations. We are going to spend about $900 million on capital expenditures as we look to continue to invest in the business, investing in profitable growth, investing in affordability and competitiveness, all of which Wes mentioned.  I'll maybe mention that from a cash perspective, we have built a little bit of working capital over the last few years. I think as an industry, you've seen that as a theme or a trend. We look at as we are growing the business, actually the ability to manage working capital to a relatively flat outcome for 2017. Again, while we are growing the top-line, so we see some ability to manage that perspective, the working capital. We'll also just mention that we do have the CAS recoveries that we are seeing that are generally equal to or just a little bit greater than the CapEx. We are expending in the year, so this is kind of a nice mix there of the recoveries on the pension and investing in the business for future growth. 
Wesley Bush : And Cai, to your question about sort of the outlook on, so I mentioned in my remarks that we see these elevated levels for another couple years. I’ll also go back to what I said in response to an earlier question, if it turns out that we are successful on a number of other new programs, depending on the magnitude of those programs and the related investments. We would enjoy that success and it could have some implications on CapEx even beyond the couple years. But we are just going to have to wait and see how all that works out. 
Cai von Rumohr: Thank you.
Kenneth Bedingfield: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. 
Robert Spingarn : Good morning or good afternoon, I should say. 
Wesley Bush : Hey, Rob. 
Kenneth Bedingfield: Hey, Rob. 
Robert Spingarn : Hey guys. I wanted to talk about this concept of – I see this dichotomy forming over contract type at DoD between low cost and best value. And I just noted, Wes, in your comments earlier on the T-X RFP and on the withdrawal of one of the teams yesterday, if that isn't starting to turn into a bit of a low cost shootout and if that might be – sounds like that just might be less appealing especially as you go here and you are working through some other contracts, that will eventually allow your Aerospace margins to rise as we get into production.  Is that something that you see? And if that's the case, how do we think about J stars in that – from that framework? Is that a best value or a low cost type of opportunity? 
Wesley Bush : Yes, Rob, it's a really good question and I think an important one in the environment that we are in and so let me give a framework that I see right now. And I think our customers actually being thoughtful in how they are approaching this.  There are some things that our customers’ going to want to buy where there isn't that much differentiation in the type of outcome of the product. And in those cases, it appears they are making what seems like a reasonably good decision to really focus on the cost and to drive for the lowest cost answer they can get.  And in some instances that might be interesting to us, if we think we've got a particular architectural approach or engineering approach that positions an end-product in a very low cost part of the coordinate system, then we might look at that and see what the returns look like. If it's a situation where it's just low cost because that's what the customer really cares about and we don't see a whole lot of differentiation across the spectrum, those are probably less interesting opportunities for us.  So if you look at the – I won't go contract-by-contract in terms of the opportunities that are out there, because we are in a competitive state right now and would not want to say too much about each and every one of them. But there are others where our customer is transmitting the message in their RFP and in other ways that while cost is always critically important, they see a little bit of a trade space between cost and performance and value. And those tend to be a little bit more interesting.  So, we look at each and every one of these and do a very detailed diagnostic and we look at it in the – through the lens, through what I would call a non-advocate lens within our company to ensure that we are not kidding ourselves about what the real investment and cost would look like and then we call it.  And sometimes it takes a little longer to call it based on the information that we need to get to a high quality decision. But we are looking at the way the customer is communicating around its view of the business deal and what's important to them to make sure that our offerings really line up the right way in a very competitive environment. 
Robert Spingarn : Thank you for your thoughts on that. 
Wesley Bush : Thanks, Rob. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS. 
David Strauss : Thanks. Good afternoon. 
Wesley Bush : Hi, David. 
David Strauss : I know, you can't say much on your restricted portfolio, getting into specifics there, but could you maybe size it for us as a percentage of sales in 2016? How much it grew and what's embedded in your guidance for 2017, specifically for restricted growth? 
Kenneth Bedingfield: David, I'm not sure that I would be able to necessarily provide guidance on what growth or what percentage it makes up specifically for 2017 but I will say that as we look at the 2016 restricted activities as a percentage of total sales, it's in the low 20% range of sales. I will tell you that it is a nicely growing part of our business, very important to us as a company and what we do and what we deliver. But that's probably the extent to which I could get into it for you. 
David Strauss : Okay.
Wesley Bush : And David, I would just add, as our customers look at the environment that we're all operating in today and the need for security, there is a lot of focus on b the restricted side. And I think there is going to continue to be a growing focus on the restricted side and I think it makes sense from a national security perspective. 
David Strauss : Thank you. 
Kenneth Bedingfield: Thanks, David. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard from Vertical. 
Robert Stallard : Thanks so much. Good evening. 
Wesley Bush : Hi, Rob. 
Robert Stallard : On the shift in mix, I don't know if you are able to quantify it, but how much is the cost plus portion shifting from 2016 to 2017 based on what you know today? 
Kenneth Bedingfield: Rob, thanks for the question. Not sure that I have that exact number in front of me. But I will tell you that we are seeing a marked increase in terms of our cost plus, think of that as largely being a development type work versus our fixed price or production type work and I am thinking that's probably in the range of a 3% shift from the 2016 actuals to 2017 and you can pick up that 2016 number in our 10-K when we file it. We expect to do that early next week. So, probably the best information I can give you at this point. 
Stephen Movius: Robin, I think we'll do one more question. 
Robert Stallard : Okay. I'll pass on then. 
Stephen Movius: Okay, thanks, Rob.
Operator: And your final question comes – is a follow-up from Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. 
Noah Poponak : Thanks. Hey, Wes, I wanted to ask you, what is the rate of growth in revenue or in EBIT dollars, which everyone is more important to you, I guess, or easier to quantify that you would need to be reasonably certain you would obtain over some multiyear period in the future in order to be willing to double your CapEx for a few years? 
Wesley Bush : Noah, I am not sure I want to actually put that out there. A lot of the way we look at our competitive profile is sort of embedded in the way I would think about answering that question. But let me say one thing and I've said this before. We are not about growing revenue. That's not the thing that motivates our company.  We are about growing value. And I think a lot of folks can make bad decisions in the defense industry in particular if they are just looking at things through the optic of the top-line. It's really the ability to capture business that translates into bottom-line growth and most importantly translates into cash generation. So that, you can make good decisions on how you use that cash.  And it's - I think an important parameter to keep in front of all of us as we look at the opportunity space that's in front of us. So we are not driving our investment strategy based on revenue growth. 
Kenneth Bedingfield: And let me just remind you, Noah, that as we think about capital deployment, we are very focused on the strategy and creating value out of the capital deployment that we do and I'll just remind you that we very clearly recognize that we are investing in the business which is our first priority.  It has to be where that is driving more value than another investment that we could make. So, I'd just remind you that we try to be very disciplined in terms of our investments and in terms of how we deploy the precious capital of the company. 
Stephen Movius: Wes, at this point in time final comments? 
Wesley Bush : Okay, thanks, Steve. I'll just wrap up by repeating what I said a bit earlier. The strong year that we had in 2016 really has laid a great foundation for us as we move into the New Year in 2017. And I am just delighted to see the strong focus on performance across our company and it really is that performance that is enabling us to invest in our future and to return cash to our shareholders. So I sincerely appreciate all that our team is doing to enable those outcomes.  So with that, thanks everyone for joining us today and thanks for your continuing interest in our company.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the Northrop Grumman's Third Quarter 2016 Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. My name is Robin and I will be your operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Steve Movius, Treasurer and Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Movius, please proceed.
Stephen C. Movius - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thanks, Robin, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's third quarter 2016 conference call. Before we start, please understand that matters discussed on today's call constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which are detailed in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risk factors may cause actual company results to differ materially. Matters discussed on today's call may also include non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled in the earnings release. On the call today is our Chairman, CEO and President, Wes Bush; and Ken Bedingfield, our CFO. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Wes.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We had another solid quarter in which all three sectors executed well. Our ongoing focus on performance, portfolio and effective cash deployment continues to drive outstanding results and positions us for profitable growth over the long term. Sales rose 3% this quarter, led by a 9% increase at Aerospace. Segment operating income was higher than last year, driven by sales volume. Our segment operating margin rate declined slightly to 11.9% and is consistent with our guidance for the year and the trend toward a higher proportion of development work. Earnings per share rose 22% to $3.35 and benefited from a favorable tax settlement and lower unallocated corporate expense in the quarter. Excluding those benefits, earnings per share rose 6%. Third quarter cash from operations was more than $700 million, approximately $180 million higher than last year. After capital expenditures of $137 million, free cash flow totaled $601 million. Typically our cash from operations is heavily weighted to the fourth quarter. We expect this year will be consistent with that pattern and we are on track to achieve our free cash flow guidance for the year. Based on this quarter's results and our fourth quarter outlook, we are raising our 2016 sales guidance to a range of $23.9 billion to $24.1 billion versus our prior guidance range of $23.5 billion to $24 billion. We continue to expect our segment operating margin rate will be in the high 11% range with total operating margin rate expectations moving to the mid-to-high 12%. And we now expect 2016 earnings per share will be between $11.55 and $11.75. During the quarter we repurchased 2.2 million shares for approximately $470 million, and year-to-date we have repurchased 5.6 million shares for approximately $1.2 billion at an average price of $207 per share. Share repurchases continue to be a significant element of our capital deployment strategy. We achieved several key program milestones and awards during the quarter. Global Hawk surpassed 200,000 flight hours and successfully completed the second of three planned sensor demonstrations by flying the Optical Bar Camera broad-area synoptic sensor. This is the first time this legacy U.S. Air Force camera has been flown on a high-altitude unmanned aircraft. Successful demonstration of this sensor capability supports the Air Force's plan for Global Hawk to assume greater responsibility for our nation's high-altitude ISR mission. Also during the quarter Triton achieved Milestone C approval. As a result, we were awarded contracts for LRIP-1 and long-lead items for LRIP-2. The transition to LRIP positions us to execute the U.S. Navy's program of record for 68 air vehicles and to move toward fulfilling missions for international customers such as Australia. The U.S. Navy also ordered 10 more Fire Scout unmanned helicopters with previously authorized funding, which will bring the Navy's fleet to 29. The Navy has also indicated that a successful Milestone C decision could lead to an award for an additional 11 helicopters. On the manned aircraft side, the Air Force declared the F-35 ready for initial operational capability and we have now completed negotiations for F-35 lots 9 and 10. We also received a U.S. Navy contract to begin producing a second E-2D Advanced Hawkeye for Japan. And the Pentagon and the State Department approved the sale of 28 F/A-18s to Kuwait, with an option to purchase 12 more of the fighter jets. If put on contract, this would extend the life of our F/A-18 production line. In summary, for AS growing volume on new development programs and programs transitioning to production continues to outpace legacy program ramp-downs. At Mission Systems, we delivered the first CIRCM missile defense systems to the Army. These systems were delivered under an EMD contract to produce the next generation of survivability equipment to defend rotary wing aircraft against manned portable air-defense systems and other heat-seeking threats. Mission Systems was also awarded a contract for nine additional G/ATOR systems for the Marine Corps. This ground/air radar system is an example of innovating to provide the best capability for the warfighter while ensuring affordability. At Technology Services, we were awarded additional contracts to continue maintenance and modernization of the UK AWACS fleet and the B-2 bomber. TS was also awarded a $108 million contract for the Social Security Administration Information Technology Support Services program. It's really gratifying to see that the investments we have made during the defense downturn, along with our aggressive approach to affordability, including the resulting improvement in our indirect rate structure, are supporting our ability to capture new, attractive programs across the enterprise. We continue to have a rich opportunity set that includes programs like the T-X trainer, Joint STARS recapitalization, Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent, SABR radar, GPS III, MQ-25 and a number of other restricted and international opportunities. Realization of these opportunities depends on our customers' ability to plan for and to fund our national security priorities. As you know, we're currently operating under a continuing resolution that expires on December 9, and as such we do not yet have an FY 2017 defense appropriations bill. A prolonged CR would likely constrain our customers' ability to achieve planned program ramp-ups and to start new programs, so we encourage Congress to work together after the elections to fund our government and to ensure its effective operations. In summary, we're pleased with our year-to-date results and our outlook. We remain well positioned to continue generating value by focusing on performance, managing our portfolio and effectively deploying our cash. So now I'll turn the call over to Ken for a more detailed discussion of third quarter results and our 2016 guidance. Ken?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thanks, Wes, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to add my thanks to the team. It was another good quarter. I'll briefly review third quarter results and provide some color on the tax settlement, unallocated corporate items, our net pension adjustment, and the outlook for the remainder of the year. Our overall results included higher sales, solid operating income and margin rate, and good cash flow, all of which positions us for a strong finish to the year. Performance was solid across the company. Sales at Aerospace rose 9% over the prior-year quarter and 6% year-to-date. Higher volume for Manned Aircraft and Autonomous Systems drove revenue growth in both periods. For both the quarter and year-to-date, Manned Aircraft reflects higher volume for restricted activities, increases in F-35 deliveries and ramp-up on the E-2D program. During the quarter we delivered 16 F-35 units versus 15 in last year's third quarter, and year-to-date we've delivered 44 units compared to 36 at this point last year. In Autonomous Systems, we continue to see higher volume across a number of programs, including Global Hawk and Triton. Growth in Manned Aircraft and Autonomous Systems is more than offsetting a slight decline in Space volume for both the quarter and year-to-date. Lower Space volume continues to be driven by reduced activity on non-restricted programs like AEHF and the James Webb Space Telescope. Aerospace third quarter operating income increased 4%, largely due to higher volume. Margin rate contracted 50 basis points to 11.2% due to the changing contract mix in Manned Aircraft partially offset by improved performance in Autonomous Systems. Year-to-date, Aerospace operating margin is 11.4%. We now expect Aerospace sales will be in the mid-$10 billion range versus our prior guidance of low-$10 billion. With this higher volume and the change in mix, we are refining our operating margin rate guidance to mid-11% from mid-to-high 11%. Mission Systems' third quarter and year-to-date sales were comparable to last year. Results for the quarter included lower volume for Sensors and Processing programs and Advanced Capabilities programs, partially offset by higher volume for Cyber and ISR activities. In Sensors and Processing, volume was impacted by certain international programs nearing completion and lower combat avionics volume due to timing of legacy F-16 and F-35 radar deliveries. Lower volume in these areas was partially offset by higher volume for new communications programs. In Advanced Capabilities, volume was lower across a number of navigation and maritime programs, partially offset by higher volume for restricted activities. Higher sales in Cyber and ISR were due to higher volume on cyber solutions programs. Mission Systems' third quarter and year-to-date operating income and margin rate were comparable to last year. Based on year-to-date results, we continue to expect Mission Systems sales in the high-$10 billion range with a high-12% operating margin rate; no change from prior guidance. Technology Services' third-quarter sales were comparable to the prior year and down 2% year-to-date. Both periods reflect the completion of several programs in 2015 and lower ICBM volume, partially offset by higher volume for the KC-10 program and an international training program. Just a reminder, we expect KC-10 sales will be winding down in 2017 as our contract nears completion. Technology Services' third-quarter and year-to-date operating income are comparable to same periods in 2015. Operating margin rate increased 20 basis points for both periods. Based on year-to-date results, we continue to expect Technology Services' sales in the mid-$4 billion range. But we are increasing guidance for operating margin rate from low-10% to mid-10%. Total segment operating margin rate was 11.9% for both the quarter and year-to-date. We continue to expect a high-11% segment margin rate for the year. Total operating margin rate was 13.4% for the third quarter, and 13% year-to-date, and included a significant reduction in unallocated corporate expense. Two items drove the $34 million improvement. The first item was a $30 million benefit for state tax refunds claimed on prior-year tax returns. The second item was a $25 million benefit recognized for estimated prior-year overhead claim recoveries. These items were partially offset by an increase in provisions for environmental remediation. Year-to-date unallocated corporate expenses are $31 million, and we now expect unallocated corporate expense will be about $100 million for the full year. You'll recall that these expenses are typically higher in the fourth quarter. In addition, during the quarter we completed the demographic study that allows us to finalize our net FAS/CAS pension adjustment for 2016. Based on the demographics update, we are increasing our net FAS/CAS pension adjustment to approximately $310 million, from the previous $275 million. Based on our sector's consistent operating performance, lower expected unallocated corporate expense, and improved net pension adjustment, we now expect a mid-to-high 12% total operating margin rate, versus our prior guidance of low-12%. Our third quarter tax rate was 21.7% versus 29.2% in last year's third quarter. The lower rate reflects this quarter's favorable tax settlement as well as the extension of the research tax credit. As we told you in July, we resolved the IRS examination of our 2007 to 2011 tax returns. As a result, our third quarter 2016 income tax expense was reduced by $42 million. We expect our 2016 effective tax rate will be approximately 25%. All of that rolls up to our increased 2016 EPS guidance of $11.55 to $11.75, which continues to assume our weighted average diluted shares decline by approximately 6%, to 181 million shares. While we increased EPS guidance, we are maintaining free cash flow guidance, as the $55 million for the unallocated corporate items will be reflected in future periods and not in 2016. We continue to expect 2016 free cash flow of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion, which continues to anticipate capital spending of $800 million to $1 billion in 2016. A final note on cash. We are evaluating tax-efficient options to repatriate certain earnings from our foreign subsidiaries. If we move forward, we would expect to repatriate the majority of our foreign cash balances. A quick update on pension. We'll be providing detailed 2017 guidance on our year-end call and it's our practice at that time to provide a three-year outlook for FAS, CAS and funding for the plans. As this has been a topic of much interest recently, I thought it would be helpful to give a quick update. Last quarter, we estimated 2017 FAS expense of $670 million, assuming a 75 basis point change in our discount rate and an 8% return on plan assets, which is about where plan asset returns were as of last Friday. FAS expense is sensitive to changes in discount rate – about a net $70 million change for every 25 basis point movement. FAS also changes by about $50 million for every 100 basis point variance from the assumed plan asset returns. CAS on the other hand is much less sensitive to interest rates and plan asset returns. As most of you are aware, CAS is discounted at a 25-year average interest rate. Under clearing assumptions, we expect CAS of approximately $1.1 billion in 2017 and 2018. In addition, holding all assumptions constant, we expect CAS will remain at about that level for at least a couple of additional years, barring major market dislocations. We also continue to expect that required cash contributions to the plans will be about $100 million for 2017 and 2018. And while we do expect higher required contributions in 2019, we estimate 2019 required contributions will be well below CAS recoveries. With that, Steve, I think we're ready for Q&A.
Stephen C. Movius - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thanks, Ken. As we open up the call for Q&A, we ask each participant to ask a single question. Robin, over to you.
Operator: Your first question comes from the line of Ron Epstein, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey, yeah, good afternoon, guys. Just maybe a quick question, if we can circle back on some of the upcoming programs. So we were expecting to see, what, a T-X RFP final one come out sometime in December. If you could talk about that a little bit, and then maybe some other things you see on the horizon as potential opportunities for the company?
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Yeah, great. It is an interesting time, in that it's clear that there is a significant recapitalization wave that's underway across a number of our customer communities. And quite frankly, it's one that's been deferred for quite a long time. And so they're facing the need to address a number of, not only recapitalization of older existing assets, the trainer program is an example of that, but also the need to address what's going on around the globe in terms of the emergence of more aggressive threat profiles. And so there is a view to the future of new capabilities. I went through a little bit of that list in some of my prepared remarks, but let me just touch on some of the ones that have a lot of focus from us. T-X is obviously a very interesting one, recapitalization of a significant fleet of aircraft for training. There are a number of competitors in this competition. And as you indicated, the Air Force is working on its sort of final round to come out with the RFP later this year. So we expect this to be quite an interesting competition and one that we're looking forward to participating in. If you kind of look across the landscape of other things, the recapitalization of the nuclear force infrastructure for the country is underway. Clearly the bomber program is an important activity there. But another one that we're quite interested in is the Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent program, GBSD, that I mentioned in my remarks. This too is another imperative for the country given the amount of time that it's been since we've really invested in our ICBM fleet, and it's an area of strong expertise and knowledge base in our company, so we see that as a really good opportunity. The space that's associated with autonomous vehicles continues to be very active. On our side, there is not only the international opportunities afforded by the success of our Global Hawk and Triton programs, but we see the Navy taking steps in the direction of yet another new program that we think will be a core part of the overall architecture for the Navy going forward. The MQ-25 program is the name that it's going by currently. And all the work that we've done over the years on our UCAS demonstrator program we think positions us well for that. So those are some examples in the Aerospace Systems world. I can go through a long list of examples as well in each of other sectors. Mission Systems, the work that they've been doing on advanced radars has positioned us exceptionally well for a number of upcoming activities, as well as the work that's ongoing in Cyber and of course the work that are involved in a number of other classes of sensors, such as the IRCM; I mentioned CIRCM in my remarks earlier as well. So both domestically and internationally we see a very long list of opportunities out there. Part of the challenge always is to make sure that we are thoughtful about which of the ones that are out there we go after. So we have, over the years, I think demonstrated a lot of discipline in how we are selecting our targets and how we're investing to pursue them. But it is a really interesting period of time where there is so much demand for the class of work that we do and we're delighted that the work that we've been doing over these last number of years has positioned us well for that.
Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Super. And just kind of one follow-on, if I may.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Yes.
Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: The momentum that we're seeing in these programs, is this just a push to modernize or is this a pull from what we're seeing in the outside world, if you know what I mean? And so I guess I am trying to drive at, I mean, how politically palatable is all this going to be as we go through the next couple of years?
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Ron, I think if you look back over the history of defense spending, it is largely driven by the world around us, the threat that we face, the issues associated with the actions of others around the globe. And it's pretty clear to me, if you look broadly across the classes of the threat profile that range all the way from near-peer competitors to the world of cyber, it's clear to me that we're seeing a growing support, and I would say this is across both sides of the aisle, a growing support for the need for the nation to really reinvest in its defense capabilities. And I would say that's the primary driver of what we're seeing is just a recognition that for our own security and the security of our allies we need to be making these investments.
Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. Thank you very much.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thanks, Ron.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned from Bernstein.
Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Yes. Thank you. I wanted to go to the F-35. You said that you've got LRIP-9 and LRIP-10 done. I wanted to understand, I am assuming that those are all priced. Lockheed Martin obviously is still negotiating with its customer. And so could you talk about how the dynamic works with your funding on those? And then also one of the things that Lockheed talked about was the higher sustainment revenues they're getting. Are you seeing anything, any portion of that yourselves in the near term?
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: All right. Doug, this is Wes, let me start and then Ken may have some things to add on that. On F-35, we have completed our negotiations on lots 9 and 10 with Lockheed, which is typical for a prime contractor to want to lock down its supply chain as it finishes off its negotiations with a customer. I would say across the board we've all seen the pace on negotiations on the LRIPs for F-35 to take a lot longer than anyone would hope. So it's clear there is opportunities here for process improvement as we go forward. But I'm sure both – that Lockheed and the JPO would point out these are huge complex programs. And so there is inherently – that degree of complexity inherently drives a little bit longer cycle time. So I think it's a matter of working our way through it collectively. But in terms of just looking at the Northrop Grumman position on this, today we have definitized with Lockheed Martin on lots 9 and 10. So we're continuing to support them obviously and the work that they're doing with the customer. It's a good team across the board with Lockheed as the prime, and we and BAE Systems are very focused on supporting them in all that they're doing. On the sustainment side, sustainment is naturally an increasing area of emphasis as we're getting jets out there and deployed. I mentioned in my remarks that the Air Force has declared IOC for the jets. So when we're helping to support an operational fleet, our experience has been that sustainment begins to tick up over time. We've been supporting sustainment already. It's typically embedded in the production contracts in terms of the spares and repairs part of the business. And as the deployment rolls out more aggressively, both I would say domestically and around the globe, we do expect to see an increase in the demand on the sustainment side. Typically that demand is focused first, as it should be, through the prime, and so Lockheed I think will see a bit more of that sustainment demand in the near term. But over time, when it comes to not only the component level but also the broader support that major teammates can provide, we expect to see a benefit from that as well. It's just critically important that these aircraft have a very high operational availability rate, and it will take the full team working together to make sure that that happens.
Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Well, and if I could just follow on that, I mean this is obviously a huge program. You mentioned some other ones, right, before. You look at GBSD, the ORP, the tanker and you add on to that things like T-X. In your discussions on the Hill, granted there are dangerous conditions in the world, people want to respond to those, but when you are on the Hill and look at the budget process today, you're looking at a lot of things that you're sort of having to fit like 15 pounds into a 10-pound bag right now. What does that tend to mean for the trajectory on funding for these programs as you see it?
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Well, clearly our customer has to set its priorities. And as we think about that set of priorities and how our work lines up with them, I see a continuing shift in the priority space to reestablishing the, if you think of it in a broad sense, reestablishing in real terms the integrity of our defense infrastructure. Today we've got a very aged infrastructure, whether we're talking about our fleet of ships, the aircraft that we have in inventory for the Air Force, and in many respects it's a product of the priorities over the last number of years where we have intentionally had to focus a bit more on operations. As we've been engaged in a number of places around the globe, first and foremost, we'll always be supporting those in uniform who are deployed and who the nation is asking to go stand in harm's way. But as we think about what we need to be doing here over the next few years, we see the priorities moving in the direction of realigning the investments against the core elements that do assure our ability to defend the country and the ability to defend our allies around the globe as we see the threat moving more towards the high end of things. So I think you've heard a lot about that coming out of the Pentagon, the need to think and act a bit more aggressively around our defense infrastructure. And so that's how we're seeing this prioritization play into what you pointed out, Doug, which is very real, which is a challenging budget environment. And I think we all expect that we'll see some challenge in the budget environment for a number of years until we can get GDP growth moving in the direction it needs to go.
Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay, great. Thank you.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thank you, Doug.
Operator: Your next question come from the line of Myles Walton, Deutsche Bank.
Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. Good afternoon.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hey, Myles.
Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: This might be one for Ken, I don't know. So cash conversion, Ken, as you look at the trajectory over the couple of years, how quickly can you improve the conversion, when do you get to 100%? And then, as you have two offsetting features, hopefully CapEx coming down and your pension contribution is going up, through cycle through the next few years, is 100% a reasonable target to be shooting at? Thanks.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Sure. And thanks for the question. I'll maybe start just by talking a little bit about the process that we work through, and I'll say that we're very much focused on managing our receivables, our net working capital. We have seen a few things that have been impacting our working capital in the last year to year and a half, burn down of advances. We've talked a little bit about contract negotiation delays. And I think you're also familiar with the impact of the DFAR clause in terms of limitation on performance-based payments. And we've seen that have a little bit of an impact as well. But we expect we're working our way through that. We were able to get, as Wes mentioned, on contract for lots 9 and 10 for F-35. That helped significantly in terms of cash conversions. And then in terms of the pension, you mentioned funding, I think you meant CAS. We do expect to see a pretty consistent CAS tailwind helping us kind of offsetting the capital expenditures that we're working on right now in terms of investing towards the future opportunities that we see. And from a funding perspective, we look at that as something that's going to be not as consequential as the recovery is on the pension side. So I think to your point, we would expect that that's a reasonable expectation as we look out over the longer term that we should be strong generators of cash. And as we grow the business we'll expect that to kind of flow through to the bottom line and flow through to the cash from operations and ultimately free cash flow.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: And Myles, I would just add one thing. I went through a rather long list of opportunities that we're addressing and one of the things that we've been focused on over the last number of years is to make sure that we invest appropriately ahead on those opportunities so that we can really drive affordability. And part of those investments are capital. And you've seen an elevated level of capital from us most recently and we've indicated we expect that will continue to be elevated for a couple more years. So, from our perspective, when we're thinking about generating the returns for the business, we want to make sure that, first and foremost, we are investing appropriately into this as we go forward. So I want to make sure that's a part of understanding and the dialogue when it comes to free cash flow, because as we look forward over the next few years, CAS recoveries will certainly be a part of that, all the other aspects that Ken mentioned with respect to the strong focus we have across the enterprise on working capital will be a big part of that. But we are investing in our company, and we expect to continue to do that.
Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Is 2018 a realistic target, though, to get to that 100%? I'm not trying to put you on the spot, but I kind of am.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Yeah, we won't give you guidance out that far, but clearly we like strong cash conversion. And we actually incentivize the team on it. So you can rest assured that it's going to be a big focus within the enterprise.
Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thank you, Myles.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, good afternoon, gentlemen.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hi, Carter.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Wes, want to ask, I know you can't talk about the program, but I want to ask a fundamental sort of overarching question about cost. Clearly, the redacted GAO document has nice things to say about your labor rates and labor costs. And as you think about competitiveness and winning business, because there's a lot of it still out there to win, is there anything we should read into that, fundamental decisions that you've made as an organization to make those rates more competitive? I mean, what should we read into that kind of commentary and what it means for your opportunities for the future? Thanks.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Well, Carter, I am glad you asked about that. With the GAO report out, and by the way, we are delighted that the GAO report has come out. I think it is important for the clarity that that report provides. It makes it clear that the GAO did perform a very rigorous and deliberate review of the work that the Air Force did, and its very thorough selection process. And it, I thought, made the very compelling case of validating that the Air Force clearly chose the most capable and affordable solution. And, in reading that GAO report, I know there are a lot of lines that are sort of blacked out, but I think it's important to, as you did, really kind of dig in and understand some of what was said there. First, I think you'll see in that report the continuing discipline that we bring to the bidding process that we've been demonstrating time and again over the years. Some years ago, and it was after we had initially been awarded a multibillion-dollar tanker program, we chose to walk away from the second round of bidding on that, because it was pretty clear to us that the new acquisition approach simply would not be an attractive program for our company or for our shareholders. And we've declined to bid on a number of other programs over the years for the same reason. And as the GAO report, I think, did a really good job of pointing out, the Air Force took a very focused and long-term approach on this program. They funded us for a number of years in advance of the bids, so we were able to mature our design. But specifically to your question, during that time that we were working our design, it became really clear to us that affordability would be absolutely critical. And we focused our efforts on a couple of things that I think are important to point out. First, obviously on the direct program, it was so important to create a design from the beginning that would be inherently more affordable to build than some other previous programs had been. And secondly, we had to work really hard to bring down our indirect rates, the overhead in the company, including efforts that we've had underway, like reducing the pension burden of cash and our rate structure. So, when we looked at all of that, we also elected to make some corporate investments to enable those affordability efforts. So we were able to bid the program with a very mature design and a disciplined approach that connected returns to investments and really drove on affordability. So it gave us a lot of confidence in our ability to go and execute on the program. And in that particular case I have to say, I have to also give a lot of credit to our customer who has been working really hard to ensure the stability requirements and funding that we all know are two of the critical ingredients for success, in addition to contractor performance. So there are a lot of things that have to come together to create that environment where affordability really sticks. And for us, it has been just a drumbeat within the company for some period of time. And as I said in my prepared remarks, I'm just really, really gratified, and I know our team around the organization is gratified, to see those efforts paying off for us. They're enabling us to bid competitively, they're enabling us to put forward new ideas about how our customer can do things a bit differently and more affordably. And I think that that is an activity that is really going to serve our customers well for the long term, and of course will serve our shareholders well, because when we are able to capture these programs and execute on them, that's how we build value. So we see it as a part of the core engine. And this new environment that – and Doug made reference to it earlier – where our customers are facing such an intensity around the budget, we simply have to be much more affordable. And it's a core part of our thought process, a core part of our strategy in the company. So I appreciate the question on it.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks for the color, Wes.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies.
Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies: Thank you very much. Not to pile on, but I think Carter asked something that's sort of important. And as you look at EACs, you have some that work for you and some that work against you, so I have sort of a two-part question. First, as you look at the unfavorable adjustments, what do you do in terms of a process in terms of trying to make sure they don't reoccur, Wes, or you get to the core of what happened and make it better going forward?
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: So on that one, Howard, and thank you for that question. Because it too is a very strong focus within our enterprise. You, I'm sure, and most on the call will recall, it was not that long ago, during the last decade, where we had a series of program issues that resulted in – unfavorable would be a kind word. They resulted in terrible adjustments that we had to make to our earnings estimates. And we took away from that process a very intensive set of learnings in the company around how you not only execute on the program but also how you bid and then prepare to execute on the program. And it is addressed across our organization in all of the operating rhythms that we have. When it comes to the discipline of bidding, we have a very comprehensive, independent, non-advocate review process that has individuals who have nothing to do with the bid come in and scrub the heck out of it and try and find everything they can that could potentially go wrong so that we can get our heads around that. It's not that we're trying to avoid every element of risk; we want to be able to manage the risk. We've also worked hard to institute in our culture the recognition that all programs of great complexity, like the ones we take on, have challenges. And good program managers get their hands up early and ask for help. It's the program managers that don't do that that end up creating problems that are hard to dig your way out of it. We like to use the analogy of a dead fish. It smells pretty bad after day one or day two, but wait for a week or two, you don't want to be anywhere near it. So for us it is all about this discipline around program execution, the clarity and transparency that we need, so that we can get the resources on issues fast. And we know there will always be issues. That's just the nature of our business, where we tend to work at the higher end of technology. But it's how you manage those risks that matters. So it is for us a strong fabric of what we look for in our program management teams. It's embedded now in the way that we do all of our training. And I think it's helped us. Are we perfect? No. And we continue to find these issues, and as you pointed out they show up in terms of unfavorables from time to time. But the discipline around getting on it fast and being able to work on it with clarity and really get to root cause so that we learn from one program on to another it's a core part of the way we operate across the company.
Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies: And then to translate that into results, you talked to – you noted that lot 9 and 10 on the F-35 is done. How should we think about your ability to – or how should we think about that contract in terms of profitability relative to the existing profitability of the business?
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Well, I would say broadly, and I'll let Ken give a little more color on it, F-35 is a program still in LRIP, which is interesting after all these years, but it's still in LRIP. And LRIP is the build up to full-rate production. And our history in our industry is that we are typically more profitable in full-rate production. So are we at a place yet on F-35 where we are satisfied with the profitability of that program? No, we are not. And I think if you ask the prime, they would give you a similar answer. But it is kind of a reflection of the stage we're in to some extent. So our efforts on F-35 in support of the work that Lockheed is doing is to continue to drive on affordability. The blueprint for affordability that we together put forward I think was a really good strategy and I was delighted to see the customer so supportive of it, to continue to aggressively find opportunities around the program to really go after cost. Because we've got to get the cost down as soon as we can so that we can really get the production rate up. It's when you're at rate when you're really able to drive on cost. And that's when you also do better on profitability. So this to me is all about getting the rate up and we need to demonstrate the affordability so we can get the rate up.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: So I think that's right. I would just add that I think we've been performing very well from an operational perspective. Unfortunately, the program is at this point not quite where we would expect a production program to be in terms of margin, but we've been working hard, working with Lockheed in terms of driving the cost per unit down. And we certainly expect as we look forward we see some volume ahead of us. As we get after that ramp, I expect that we can drive the margin up to where we expect a more reasonable, mature production margin to be.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: And we're all looking forward to this. We see F-35 is a really good program. It's clear the need for it both in the U.S. and around the globe, so we simply need to work our way through this part of the process and get this thing into full rate.
Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies: Thanks. Thanks, gentlemen.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thank you, Howard.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi.
Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Good morning, or good afternoon, everybody. Just a quick question on margins. Wes, could you talk a little bit about the contracting environment and whether it is changing at all and whether that will have either a positive or negative impact on the outlook for margins structurally for the company? And then, Ken, on the margin question, you've spoken in the past about some of the headwinds at Aerospace over the next couple of years because of mix. You've also talked about some tailwinds. Can you just provide us a quick update, kind of where we are from your view on the likelihood of holding Aerospace margins roughly flat here as we transition into more revenue streams coming from lower-margin programs?
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Yeah, I'll start on the environment, then hand over to Ken. Just what I see, and I talked a little bit about this already in response to some of the earlier questions, what I see in our environment today is just a great pressure on our customers to fit it all in. The budget has not grown as fast as the threat, but no one has told our customers they've only got to deal with 70% of the threat because they're getting 70% of what they need. And so I fully understand where they're coming from, that things have to become much more affordable. And oftentimes I think people hear that as some sort of great conflict between the defense industrial base and our customer community; it's not. What our customers are saying is they've got to be able to get more capability at a lower cost and that's just the way it is. And we all know it doesn't do much good to go fight over the small percentage differences that you can negotiate around profitability. The place you make headway on this is to go after the 80%, 85%, 90%, whatever it is, that's the core cost. And so that's our focus – drive affordability by taking out cost. And when we do that, what we've seen is we see a customer that's eager to incentivize our performance with good profitability. So I think it's a good, healthy, balanced relationship that we have with our customer community. I know that on individual contracts there can be lots of dialogue around, well, is it this percent or that percent on profitability. But we all know ultimately at the end of the day nibbling away at profitability is not the answer. It's driving on cost and driving affordability so that our customer can get done what they need to get done. And at the senior levels in our customer community, at the program office levels, I think they understand that. I see good dialogue and engagement around that, but they do need to see more affordability from the industrial base and that is our focus.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: I would agree with that. I would say that overall the contracting environment is consistent to improving in terms of how we're dialoging with the customer on that front. And ultimately, in terms of margins, I think it's going to come down to performance and mix. The bottom line is we have got to continue to perform on our programs. I think we've been doing a good job of that here over the last few years. And largely what we're seeing in terms of our margin rates and the margin rate, particularly at AS to your question, is driven by mix. I think if you look at our disclosures, you'll see that we have talked about it's basically some additional development work that's working its way into the revenue stream. We do continue to see that we've got production opportunities as well. It's just that the increase on the development side this quarter is larger than the production side. But we talked about on the production F-35 increased, E-2D increased. So we're seeing some volume there as well. At the end of the day, I think it comes down to again mix, but then our ability to perform. And I'll just remind you that one of our key metrics for our team is margin rate. And so we continue to make sure the team is focused on driving margin rate. And again, it's not against our own forecast or our own budgets, but driving margin rate to be higher than our peers. And that's how we incentivize the team, and we certainly hope that we'll continue to deliver strong results in that regard.
Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Great. Thanks, guys.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Thanks, Jason.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hi, Noah.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi, good afternoon. Hey, Ken, how are you?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Good.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I had a few other questions on AS. So first on F-35, could you just update us on roughly how large a percentage of revenue that is in this year's plan, and roughly where it gets to once you're at full rate?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: In terms of this year, Noah, I would say that we're looking at about 7% for F-35 in terms of the total percentage of revenue. And that's again, I'll just remind you, that's contracts at both AS and MS, so it's the center fuselage as well as the radar, the DAS and the CNI. About two-thirds of that comes from AS and a third from MS. In terms of the longer period after the plan, I would say, look, we're looking forward to ramping volume on F-35. We've invested for the ramp, we've got an automated production line that's ready to roll. It's just a matter of how that moves versus the various other programs that we've got. We've talked about some of the development programs as well as other production programs like E-2D and Triton. We're very excited to be into production on the Triton program. So that one probably has a few too many complicating factors to tell you precisely what that percentage is, but we are looking forward to seeing additional volume on F-35.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. You mentioned, I think you used the term ramp-up on E-2D in the prepared remarks, or in the release. I thought that that program was growing but at a relatively low or stable rate compared to some of your other programs. Is that wrong, or maybe just how quickly is E-2D growing for you currently?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: I would say that E-2D is – as the production on E-2D has moved into the multi-year phase, you'll probably remember we had a full-rate production contract and then moved into multi-year, which was a five-year, 25-aircraft deal. And as we've moved into the multi-year program and that's starting to work its way through the production line, we are seeing some ramp in the volume. I would say it's maybe more on the modest side, but it's going to continue to drive additional revenues as we look forward. And it's a very important program to us, one of our largest programs at Aerospace, and it's a contributor for sure.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Yeah. And we're just beginning to address the international opportunity on E-2D with Japan. And over time, as we saw historically with E-2C, we think there will be nice international opportunities on E-2D, so that will drive some of that opportunity space as well.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Wes, how big could that become relative to your domestic sales there?
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: On E2? Historically, the domestic side of E2 has been the bigger part, and I think that will be the case here as well. But we have a number of allies around the globe who are interested in this capability, and the Navy has been very supportive of that interest, so it's a little bit too early to tell, but I do think it will have some nice international opportunity.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. And then just last piece. The Space program declines that you've mentioned in AS, when do those annualize? And I guess, what is that sort of piece of the segment grow, if anything, once those programs have annualized and rebased?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Noah, in talking about the Space business, maybe let me just kind of step back for a second and say, in terms of programs that are in declining mode, yes, we have AEHF and the James Webb Space Telescope. We've kind of seen, I think, the ramp-down on those, and we'll probably be at a more consistent level as we look forward. But I think it's important to recognize that we manage the Space business really as an overall portfolio. And unfortunately, a large part of that business is one that we can't talk a lot about. But I will say that we are seeing some growth in other areas of the business. And overall, we think that the declines in Space will probably work their way through the system in 2017. And largely, when we look at that business as a whole and we look as it moves forward, we expect that we'll see some growth over the long term in the Space business. It's a robust business, and has some opportunity sets in front of us that Wes mentioned. So we look at that as something that will be growing over the long term.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Yeah, and I would just add that there are a few basic drivers, and those drivers actually do result in the down ramp that we'll see, at least through next year a little bit, as Ken said, on the unrestricted side of our Space business. And that's the relook that's going into the Space architecture, where it's pretty clear, on a go-forward basis, Space is no longer a sanctuary and we're going to have to think about that architecturally. And our customers being thoughtful on that, and it will take a little bit of time to sort out exactly how they want to acquire the new capability. So I think it's kind of a natural process on our unrestricted Space business. The restricted side of the business continues to be quite healthy.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.
Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Thanks very much, and good afternoon.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Hi, Seth.
Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. Ken, just a brief question for you. A lot of the upward pressure on working capital this year has been in receivables, and there is typically some, but it's been more this year. Is that a driver of the strong free cash flow that you expect in the first quarter? Is there kind of one thing there that's outstanding to collect that kind of changes things, or is it a bunch of different things? Maybe if you could just address that topic a little bit.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Sure. I've commented a little bit on that earlier in terms of some of the burndown of advances that we've seen on a couple international programs. And also I think, as we've had a few contractual delays that have impacted the timing of cash flows and the working capital, as well as I mentioned the DFAR clause, in terms of limitation on performance-based payments. But largely, I don't think we see anything in there other than timing, for the most part. If you look at our historical timing of cash flows, we're much stronger in the fourth quarter, just in terms of how our business flows through the year, we're much stronger in terms of inflows in the fourth quarter, and we expect that to be a continued trend this year. We'll have a strong finish to the year, and we're confident that we'll be within our range from a free cash flow perspective. That cash flow will come out of those receivables and drive the working capital down, so I think at the end of the year, you'll see that we're at a level of working capital that's about – more consistent with where we normally are by year-end. And then we'll continue to focus on this as we move forward. We are working with our customer on the impact of the DFAR clause on working capital, and how we manage that going forward. I think they recognize that that's important to both parties, in terms of an appropriate level of cash flow for the type of contract and for the cost profile that's incurred on that contract. So, no issues in terms of overall collectability or any significant change in our ability to manage the working capital. I think we just got to work through these couple things, and we'll see our cash flows start to increase as we grow the business, as we look forward.
Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
Stephen C. Movius - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Robin, we've got time for one more.
Operator: Thank you, sir. And your last question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yes, thank you. So your 10-Q indicates that your backlog at AS and Mission Systems was up from year-end. While you didn't give the exact level of the backlog, should you look for that backlog to move up from the third quarter level by year-end?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Cai, I'll say that, in terms of backlog, we did make a change in terms of our quarterly disclosure of it this year. And I wouldn't be able to say much more than the trend data that we've got in the document. Both AS and MS are up from the year-end, and TS we disclosed was down slightly from last year. And largely what I'll tell you is that the quarterly impact of awards we view as kind of, yeah, sure it has some lumpiness to it, and looking at this over the longer term we think is the more appropriate way to think about awards. And year-end we'll endeavor to provide the level of backlog detail that you all will be looking for. And I think that's probably the most information I can give you at this point in time.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: Last quick one. When you look at your cash deployment for shareholders, dividends and repurchase, it's tended to exceed by a fair margin your free cash flow. Should we expect that to continue in the future? And how do you look at the relative priorities between dividends for shareholders and stock repurchase?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.: So Cai, I would say that we undertook an effort to buy back 25% of the outstanding shares of the company in 2013. We worked that through the system through the fourth quarter of last year and that resulted in a significant amount of capital deployed in excess of free cash flow. I wouldn't necessarily expect that to continue as you look forward. We would expect to be essentially deploying cash in a manner that says, look, we're going to invest in the business, as Wes mentioned. We're investing higher in terms of CapEx. We pay a competitive dividend; you saw we increased our dividends again in May. And then excess cash we tend to deploy through share repurchases. We take a pretty consistent approach to share repurchase. We're not speculative. We set a plan and we go after it. In terms of maybe what you're seeing is we finished the 25% repurchase in the fourth quarter of last year. We kind of have a little bit of a slower first part of the year this year in terms of cash generation, so we spent a little bit more than 100%. But as we generate the cash in the fourth quarter I think you'll start to see that normalize a bit.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you.
Stephen C. Movius - Northrop Grumman Corp.: Okay. Robin, I think that's all the time we have right now, so I am going to turn it over to Wes for final comments.
Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.: All right. Thanks, Steve. Let me wrap up by thanking our team. We are just so fortunate to have an amazing group of people across our company who are focused on performing for our customers and our shareholders, and I sincerely appreciate all that they are doing. So thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call today and thanks for your continuing interest in our company.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the Northrop Grumman's Second Quarter 2016 Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. My name is Robin and I will be your operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. I would now like to turn the call over to our host, Mr. Steve Movius, Treasurer and Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Movius, please proceed.
Stephen C. Movius - Corporate Vice President and Treasurer, Vice President Investor Relations: Thanks, Robin, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's second quarter 2016 conference call. Before we start, please understand the matters discussed on today's call constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which are detailed in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risk factors may cause actual company results to differ materially. Matters discussed on today's call may also include non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled in the earnings release. I would also note that after the conclusion of today's call, we will be posting an updated Northrop Grumman overview to the Investor Relations page of our website. The overview includes detailed information on each of our three sectors. On the call today is our Chairman, CEO and President, Wes Bush; and Ken Bedingfield, our CFO. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Wes.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: All right, thanks, Steve. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We had a very strong second quarter, driven by solid operational execution and effective cash deployment. I want to thank our team for their unwavering focus on performance. Second quarter sales totaled $6 billion, 2% higher than last year's second quarter, driven by growth at both Aerospace Systems and Mission Systems. At Aerospace Systems, we're reaching an inflection point, where new programs and the planned ramp-ups on production programs are beginning to outpace declines on mature legacy programs. While we may see some variability in that trend going forward, the growth in manned and autonomous systems drove a 4% second quarter sales increase. The programs driving sales include our restricted programs, the production ramp-up on F-35 Triton and volume in Global Hawk, as we began production for international customers. These growing programs are more than offsetting the expected declines in AS programs such as NATO AGS, F/A-18, Advanced EHF and the James Webb Space Telescope. Sales at Mission Systems grew in the second quarter, driven by higher volume for restricted programs and ramp-ups on programs like F-35, G/ATOR, SEWIP Block III, JCREW and (2:51). We delivered our first (2:53) Systems in June and we expect this program to continue ramping up. The reorganization at Technology Services at the beginning of this year has enabled us to sharpen our focus on reshaping its portfolio to better align with our strategy of providing differentiated services and capabilities in this market space. We see this as an important business for our company. And while these portfolio actions may impact sales growth at TS in the near-term, we see this restructuring process as key to aligning our investments and capabilities at TS with our longer-term growth objectives for this business. Enterprise-wide, as we continue to add new programs and shape our portfolio, we remain focused on sustaining strong performance and operational excellence. This focus enabled all three of our businesses to contribute to a solid 12.2% segment operating margin rate in the second quarter and a 12% rate year-to-date. Second quarter EPS increased 4% to $2.85. And based on our year-to-date results and a tax benefit that we will record in the third quarter, we are increasing 2016 EPS guidance to a range of $10.75 to $11 versus our prior guidance of $10.40 to $10.70. Second quarter cash from operations was approximately $600 million, consistent with last year's second quarter. Capital expenditures totaled $173 million and free cash flow totaled $431 million. As we've mentioned on previous calls, our capital spending plans contemplate the purchase of several buildings this year. And during the first half of the year, we implemented those plans, with facilities purchases totaling approximately $240 million. This includes a facility purchased for $80 million in the second quarter. At the midpoint of the year, capital spending was $471 million and we now expect our 2016 capital spending will range between $800 million and $1 billion. We continue to expect free cash flow of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion. In addition to investing in our businesses, we continue to return cash to shareholders. In May, we increased our quarterly dividend 12.5% to an annual rate of $3.60, our 13th consecutive annual dividend increase, and our fifth consecutive double-digit increase. We also continue to repurchase our shares. During the quarter, we bought back 1.9 million shares, bringing year-to-date repurchases to 3.4 million shares. At the end of the second quarter, approximately $3.6 billion remained on our share repurchase authorization. We do not yet have an FY 2017 Defense Appropriations Bill. And as Congress has adjourned until September, it is increasingly likely that we will begin the government's fiscal year 2017 with a Continuing Resolution. As you know, a CR will constrain our customers' ability to achieve planned program ramp-ups and to start new programs. Beginning the new fiscal year with a CR has unfortunately become a familiar scenario. The larger concern is how long the CR lasts. Obviously, the longer a CR lasts, the more disruptive it is to our customers' acquisitions plans. So, we encourage Congress to work together to fund our government and enable its effective operations. In summary, we're pleased with our year-to-date results. And we expect our focus on performance to continue to generate solid results for the remainder of 2016, as demonstrated by our updated guidance. We remain well-positioned to achieve profitable long term growth, and we continue to generate value through performance, managing our portfolio and our approach to cash deployment. So, now, I'll turn the call over to Ken for a more detailed discussion of our results and our guidance. Ken?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President: Thanks, Wes, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to add my congratulations to the team on our second quarter performance. Today, I'll briefly review second quarter results and provide a bit more detail on our 2016 guidance. It was a good quarter, with higher sales and EPS, and strong margin rates and cash flow. Performance was strong at all three sectors. Aerospace Systems sales rose 4% in both the quarter and year-to-date periods. Increases in both periods reflect higher volume on manned aircraft programs and autonomous systems, which more than offset a low single-digit decline in space volume due to lower non-restricted activity on programs like AEHF and the James Webb Space Telescope. Restricted activities and higher F-35 deliveries were the growth drivers in manned aircraft. Growth in these areas more than offset lower volume for the F/A-18 and B-2 programs. The F/A-18 continues to ramp down. We delivered five units this quarter versus eight units in last year's second quarter. Lower volume on the B-2 is due to timing of modernization activities. In autonomous systems, volume continues to ramp up on Triton and Global Hawk, more than offsetting lower activity on other autonomous programs, primarily NATO AGS. While space sales were lower, volume for restricted activities grew, but did not fully offset lower volume for the non-restricted space programs I referenced earlier. Aerospace Systems' operating income declined slightly. Change in contract mix and a timing of risk retirements more than offset the impact of higher sales. Operating margin rate was 12% versus 12.8% in the last year's second quarter. And most of you will recall that last year's results benefited from risk retirements on a restricted program. At the midpoint of the year, Aerospace is on track to achieve our sales guidance in the low $10 billion range. Through six months, Aerospace has an operating margin rate of 11.6% and we continue to expect AS to generate a margin rate in the mid to high 11% range, no change from prior guidance. Mission Systems second quarter sales grew more than 2% and year-to-date MS sales are up 1%. Both periods reflect higher sales volume for Advanced Capabilities programs, as well as Sensors and Processing programs. The primary drivers in Advanced Capabilities are restricted programs and ramp-up on several navigation and maritime programs, including SEWIP Block III. Ramp-up on G/ATOR contributed to higher Sensors and Processing volume in both periods and JCREW contributed to the second quarter increase. Mission Systems second quarter operating income increased 1% and operating margin rate was 13%. Year-to-date MS operating income is up 2%, with an operating margin rate of 13.1%. Based on year-to-date results, we continue to expect Mission Systems sales in the high $10 billion range, unchanged from prior guidance. And based on strong year-to-date results, we are increasing our guidance for operating margin rate to the high 12% range versus our prior guidance of a mid-to-high 12%. Technology Services second quarter sales declined 2% and year-to-date sales are down 3%. The trend for both periods reflects the completion of several programs in 2015, lower ICBM volume as well as the ongoing repositioning of the business portfolio, as mentioned by Wes. Second quarter operating income increased 2% and operating margin rate expanded 50 basis points to 10.8% due to improved performance. Year-to-date, TS operating margin rate has expanded 20 basis points to 10.6%, and we are raising our margin guidance to low 10% from our prior guidance of approximately 10%. We continue to expect TS sales in the mid-$4 billion range. Total segment operating margin was 12.2% for the quarter and 12% year-to-date. We continue to expect a high 11% segment margin rate for the year. Total operating margin rate was 13.3% for the second quarter and 12.8% year-to-date. We now expect a low 12% total operating margin rate for the year versus our prior guidance of approximately 12%. Our updated guidance assumes unallocated corporate expenses of $175 million, lower than our prior estimate of approximately $200 million. You'll recall that our unallocated corporate expense is typically more heavily weighted toward the second half of the year, with the fourth quarter generally being the highest. We expect that to be the case again this year. Our guidance also includes net FAS/CAS pension adjustment of $275 million. Keep in mind that we will be finalizing our 2016 pension demographic study in the third quarter. The study results may impact our net FAS/CAS pension adjustment for 2016, so no change to the guidance until that is finalized. Wes mentioned one of the drivers of our EPS guidance increase is a tax benefit we will record in the third quarter. After the close of the second quarter, we received approval from the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation for the resolution of the IRS examination of our 2007 to 2011 tax returns. As a result, our third quarter 2016 income tax expense will be reduced by approximately $40 million. This will reduce our 2016 expected effective tax rate to approximately 25.5% and provide approximately $0.20 more in EPS. All that rolls up to our increased 2016 EPS guidance of $10.75 to $11, which continues to assume our weighted average diluted shares decline by approximately 6% to 181 million shares. We continue to expect 2016 free cash flow will range between $1.5 billion and $1.8 billion. Our free cash flow guidance now anticipates capital spending of $800 million to $1 billion in 2016 versus our prior guidance of $700 million to $1 billion. A quick update on backlog, as we indicated last quarter, we intend to report backlog for the full year and provide trend information each quarter. Year-to-date, our backlog has increased and reflects higher backlog at Aerospace, a modest decline in backlog at Mission Systems and a high single-digit decline at Technology Services. Looking ahead to next year, and in light of the significant decline in interest rates through mid-year, I thought it would be helpful to remind everyone of our discount rate and plan asset returns sensitivities as they may impact our 2017 FAS expense. Every 25 basis point change in our discount rate results in a net impact of approximately $70 million to our 2017 FAS expense. And every 100 basis point difference in our 8% return assumption and actual plan return changes 2017 FAS by approximately $50 million. In January, we provided a $470 million estimate for 2017 FAS based on a 4.53% discount rate and plan asset returns of 8%. Year-to-date plan asset returns are a bit north of 6%. And as you're all aware, benchmark interest rates have declined by about 75 basis points. If we had to set our discount rate today and holding all other assumptions constant, our expected 2017 FAS expense would be about $200 million higher, or $670 million. But obviously, a lot can happen between now and year-end. We continue to expect CAS expense of approximately $1 billion for 2017, and we continue to expect 2017 and 2018 required cash contributions will remain fairly low at about $100 million each year. I don't expect much volatility in these required pension contributions, barring major market disruptions. One final note on Brexit, while it's too early to predict any long-term impacts Brexit may have on our business, we saw no material impact to second quarter results. We have limited foreign currency exposures related to the affected currencies and we had significant contract-related exposure. We did see a decrement in our reported cash balances in U.S. dollars of about $30 million, which reflects the conversion of balances held in affected foreign currencies. With that, I think we're ready for Q&A. I'll turn it back over to Steve.
Stephen C. Movius - Corporate Vice President and Treasurer, Vice President Investor Relations: Thanks, Ken. As we open up the call for Q&A, we ask each participant to ask a single question, and please rejoin the queue if you have a following question. Robin, if you could open up the line?
Operator: Your first question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.
Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks, good afternoon, guys.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President: Hey, Myles.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Myles, how are you?
Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I was hoping to talk a little bit about cash for a second. Lockheed brought up on their call the F-35 lack of contracts under signature being a headwind to ongoing funding of, obviously, their suppliers and their work to make sure everything stays on schedule. Is there a similar kind of cash drag that you're experiencing now? Can you size it, and is it any risk to full year cash flow?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President: Hey, Myles, thanks for the question. In terms of our cash on F-35, our profile is a little bit different than Lockheed's, as they're prime and we're sub. We are on progress payments today as we perform on our work that's in the flow today. And as we get on contract on LRIPs 9 and 10, we will move to performance-based payments. That will liquidate some of the withhold that we see, primarily at the AS sector in terms of cash flow, but we fully expect that we'll get that resolved, and should see that sort itself out by the end of the year.
Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Richard Safran from Buckingham Research.
Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Wes, Ken, Steve, good afternoon.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President: Good afternoon.
Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: So, I just have a quick question here on Technology Services. You say, if I got my math right, you saw a 50 basis points higher margins on slightly lower sales. The only comment you made was improved performance. So, I thought, I wanted to ask if you could discuss the quarter in a bit more detail and maybe longer term expectations. Near-term, are you seeing a better mix of more favorable contracts? Thinking more longer-term, are business conditions improving overall? Are you seeing more favorable contract terms, or is the margin improvement mostly just due to restructuring and taking out cost?
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: So, I'll start on that. This is Wes. And let me then turn to Ken to perhaps give a little bit more color on some of the aspects. Overall, when we say performance is the primary driver, that's actually what we mean. TS has a rather significant mix of different contracts across its portfolio. And credit to the team, they've been doing a really good job on executing on those contracts. So, it's a broad reflection of the work that's being done across the organization, just to continue to drive on program execution, particularly, I would say, in the global logistics and modernization part of the portfolio, where we're seeing some especially good program performance. I mentioned in my earlier remarks that we are working on portfolio in TS. The reorganization that we did at beginning of the year has allowed us to really pull together the broad set of our service and modernization-oriented activities, and kind of step back and look at that market space and ask ourselves how we really want to position to compete over the long-term. And so we're going through some thinking on which of those areas we're going to continue to invest in and others that we may tune down on as we go forward. And as I mentioned in remarks, any time we go through a little portfolio tuning, that can in the near-term impact the growth trajectory, but over the long-term, we see this as a very good business for our company, one that we are absolutely committed to being into, and the idea is to make sure that we're investing in the places where we see really differentiated capabilities. And with differentiated capabilities, we're able to focus on the areas that provide the better margin rates. And that's our strategy as sort of stated in a broad context, but we're looking at that, the implications of that strategy, in each of the three parts of the TS business. So, it's not just one of the components of that business that are the focus of this activity. And it's enabling us, I think, to better position the organization for longer-term growth. Ken, anything do you'd want to add to that?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President: Yeah. Let me just add that I would say, I agree it's a matter of TS having a broad portfolio of contracts, that are generally differentiated in the types of services we offer, and just real good execution by the team this quarter. There was really no major program or no major area that drove the majority of the increase. All of the sectors are innovative teams that work really hard to deliver, and they've shown that they can do that this quarter. And, I would just say that maybe another piece of it kind of broadly is disciplined bidding behavior and making sure that we're going after the right work that can deliver the right margins as we look forward. So, I think that's an important piece of it as well.
Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Well, thanks very much.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Rich.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.
George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC: Yes.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, George.
George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC: Good morning.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President: Hi, George.
George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC: I was looking at, Ken, your guidance for Aero Systems at low $10 billion range in the context of, Wes, your comment that this quarter is the first quarter you've started to see new programs outpace the legacy programs. So, why wouldn't the subsequent quarters have higher sales and why wouldn't the low $10 billion guidance be somewhat low for the year?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President: George, I would say that halfway through the year, we're a bit shy of $5.2 billion in sales. We've got programs that are ramping in terms of volume and programs that are declining. We mentioned F/A-18, AHF (sic) [AEHF] (22:51), and James Webb on the declining side. So, as we look at the profile, I think we don't generally see significant fluctuations quarter-to-quarter. We don't tend to see a big fourth quarter like some of the other participants in the industry. And, I think the other impact we're looking at is a fewer number of working days in the fourth quarter of 2016, which is driving kind of a fewer number of second half versus first half days in the year based on our quarterly accounting conventions. So, overall, I would say that we see certainly a solid path to the low-$10 billion range and the team will work hard to deliver solid results for the rest of the year.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: And this is Wes. I'd just add that from quarter-to-quarter, we may see a little bit of variability, but I think the thrust of your question applied to the long-term is exactly right. We see AS on an upward trajectory over the next number of years as we are executing that broad variety of programs that I mentioned in my remarks. So while quarter-to-quarter, we may see some little ups and downs, the trajectory that you mentioned is the right one.
George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC: Okay, thanks.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President: Thank you, George.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good afternoon.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Sam.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit philosophically, I guess, about the cash balances. Just looking at you're down to about a $1.1 billion this quarter, it's kind of as low as I can remember. I know the second half cash is always better than the first half, so that will build. But just thinking about what is the right amount of cash to run the business? Does that make you think differently about how you return cash to shareholders? I'm just trying to think about how we see things move from here?
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks for the question, Sam. I would comment that we are satisfied with the amount of cash we have on the balance sheet and satisfied with our liquidity position. It's a bit lower than where we were the second quarter of last year. I think we were a bit north of $1.25 billion, somewhere shy of $1.3 billion last year at this time. So, we're looking forward to a strong second half in terms of cash generation. I think you'll remember that that's pretty consistent with our normal historical pattern of cash generation, although I'm determined to figure out how to pull some of that forward into the first half of the year as we look forward. But overall, we don't have any concerns about where we ended up the second quarter on cash and look forward to solid second half of the year and then delivering continued solid cash results from there as we move forward.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President: Sam I'd just add it's always the balance. We want to put our cash to work and making sure that we've got the right balance between putting it to work and having the adequate balance we need just to run the business is somewhat a reflection of the volatility that we see from time-to-time in the market space. During the period of time where we were dealing with shutdowns and some of those other issues, that biased us a little bit more in the direction of a more significant balance. It's hard to tell that we're necessarily in a period of greater stability on funding. We'll see how this whole CR process works out. But it's working to find the right balance in that overall equation with a strong bias towards putting our money to work.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, good afternoon, everyone.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, Noah. How are you?
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Pretty good. How are you, Ken?
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, could you update us on the FASB change and the possible revenue recognition change, where your units of delivery, and I don't know if there could be a change or not on F-35 for you?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President: Sure. The rev rec standard, we do expect will result in a change to a number of our programs, F-35 probably being the largest in terms of those programs for which we are on units of delivery. If you think about it, essentially, we will take units of delivery sales in the year of adoption and we'll take those units of delivery out and replace it with cost to cost sales. So, generally, we expect it to have a not too significant impact in terms of any particular year in regards to the P&L, and the sales and earnings to be generated. Certainly, something we're spending a fair amount of time on. Our accounting folks are working hard on that. We do expect to have that fully analyzed and our method of adoption identified by the end of 2016. And I'd say we're well on track to dealing with that issue, and we don't see it as significantly impactful to any particular P&L as we look forward.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. It seemed like potentially something like F-35, where the program is ramping pretty significantly and you're a long lead supplier, if you had to switch overnight to POC, it would sort of create just like a step-up in the revenue, but it sounds like that's not necessarily the case?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President: The pull-forward could result in a little bit more revenue than units of delivery. It really depends on timing in terms of what's being delivered that quarter versus the work in flow. And so, it's still a little bit out in front of us. The closer we get to it, the more accurate I could give you an impact of what likely increase. There likely would be some increase there, although some other programs could result in some decreases going the other way. So, as we get closer, we'll be able to give you a better picture of that.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: But you think you'll be on it in 1Q 2017, basically?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President: 1Q 2018.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Oh, okay. So, you'll just...
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President: And we'll have a likely retrospective look back.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. So, did you say you'll decide exactly what you're doing by the end of this year?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President: By the end of the year, yeah.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: But you won't actually switch in the financial statements till 2018.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President: That's right. We'll select our method of transition, but the transition itself will be the first of 2018.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. And...
Operator: And your next question is from the line of Doug Harned from Bernstein.
Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good afternoon.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, Doug.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President: Hi, Doug.
Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: I wanted to talk about Aerospace. And you talked about expectations over the next few years for a ramp there. When you look at across those next few years in terms of margin, you've clearly got the B-21 ramping up in development, I know it's something you probably can't say much about, but when you look at Aerospace as a whole, do you think you can maintain margins at current levels even with the mix shift? And I would imagine the people working there would like that, too, given that incentives are tied to margin levels.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President: Thanks for the question, Doug. Let me start and maybe Wes will add some comments at the end. But in terms of mix, we do have some additional development coming in. You talked about the B-21 and there's always a mix of development versus production work, as we look. But the other piece of this is that we've also got a fair amount of production. We spent a little bit of time talking about F-35 today, as that production should mature and ramp. E-2D is in mature production. And Wes mentioned we're looking to get to LRIP on Triton. So, we've got a bit working both ways. We do incentivize the team to perform better than the benchmark and its peers. That benchmark continues to be 11% for Aerospace. And I would say maintaining historically a strong level mix of production versus development, I think will that move one way or the other, yes. I think development could move up, but I don't think it swings so wildly that margin rates are unsustainable. I think I've described margin rates as kind of relatively range-bound. We certainly don't expect any precipitous drop in rates. And one thing we know is, is the team out there will continue to drive and find ways to perform.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, I think Ken said it well, Doug. I guess the way I would frame it is, if you just look at the mix of development and production that we have, we have every opportunity to continue to do well on margin rate, so it comes down to performance. The other variable is how much more we win, and we'd like to win some more. And we think we are well-positioned and we're working hard to provide our customers with some very innovative offerings, so we'd like to continue to add development content to the business as we can. But at the same time, and Ken mentioned this, we're going to the team incentivized based on our benchmarking process, where we need to do better than the benchmarks. So, we only want good wins. We want wins that will help us continue to perform well, and where we're going to be able to deliver the customer really good capabilities. So, our future wins could have, if you think about it in broad context, could have some impact on the mix. So again, it's going to come back for performance (33:24). So I think we have a good opportunity to continue to do well on the margin rates at AS while we continue to work on some additional captures to continue to grow that business. And the bottom line is we got to perform.
Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: So, the mix as you see it now, it seems reasonable to you that you could keep margins here if you perform well, that there's no fundamental trend that's going to take them down, I guess?
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I don't see a precipitous drop in the margin rates, assuming we continue to perform.
Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Joseph DeNardi from Stifel, Nicolaus.
Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Thank you very much. Wes, sorry for another question on Aerospace, but if you look at the three headwinds you've got this year, the James Webb, AHF (sic) [AEHF] (34:13), and F-18, are those more of a headwind next year or does that start to ease a little bit in 2017?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President: Joe, I would say that largely those headwinds start to ease a bit in 2017. The F-18 should kind of flatten out and stay at a delivery level of about two a month. The others could see a little bit more decline as they continue to mature, but I don't see it as a particularly significant drop in those programs.
Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Ken.
Operator: Your next question is from Jason Gursky with Citi.
Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hey, good afternoon, everyone.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President: Hi, Jason.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, Jason.
Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Wes, I was wondering if you could dive a little bit deeper on the TS restructuring. How long is this going to take? When do you think revenue streams could inflect higher there to get some growth out of it? And, just what are you going to be prioritizing there as you work through this process?
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: So, it's a little hard right now to project on the timeline for it, just given the fact that as we make our decisions, we, at the same time, make sure that we continue to support our customers. We're a company that never leaves a customer high and dry simply because we've decided that we're changing a part of the portfolio. And, I'll give you an example on that. Our approach in state and local, where we've been pretty clear that we've been ramping down our business in the state and local marketplace over the last few years. And so, we're not rebidding on a lot of new things. But, in many cases, those customers need us to hang in there a little bit longer to affect a smooth transition. And we're committed to making sure we support them. So, a lot of the variability here is on the nature of the customer needs to ensure that nobody gets left hanging in some manner. We want to make sure we support them well. My experience on these transitions, as we've gone through them over the last few years, suggests that it takes usually, at a minimum, about a year, but sometimes it can be a little bit longer than that to affect the portfolio shaping. Some of that gets assisted by where the new bids are. And we can elect in many cases to just simply not rebid in an area that we're working to transition out. And you asked for a few examples. So, state and local is one, where we are continuing to work our way down through that process. There are other areas, both in the global logistics and modernization programs, as well as our modernization services, and our advanced defense services businesses, where we're looking at the nature of how the customer is buying. If their approach to buying is shaping things more in the direction of the commodity services, that's really not the part of the marketplace that we see ourselves as adding great value. We tend to do a better job for our customers in areas where they need some aspect of technology componentry as a part of what they're doing or they need engineering applied to the outcomes for the products or services that they're looking at. And that, over time, continues to shape and shift a little bit. So, this is really down at the business unit level, where we're sorting through each of these areas and making those decisions. And I think you'll see the outcomes of some of those decisions as we begin to talk a little bit more about 2017. And then, that'll allow us to lock in on it and make sure we're investing on it the right way and move through that as we move into 2018 and beyond.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President: Wes, let me just add to that, that a couple of other things to think about. One, for TS, I think it's important to think about its intercompany focus and the work that it does supporting and being really integrated with MS and AS. And you've seen that growing as a percentage of TS's sales. And I would expect that's going to continue to be a strong and important part of its business. One other impact as we look forward was a re-compete this year, where we bid what we believed was an appropriate margin rate for this type of work. And unfortunately, were not successful in that bid. So, that impacts the business as we look forward as well, and all that's factored in.
Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay, great. Thanks, gentlemen.
Operator: Your next question is from Carter Copeland with Barclays.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey. Good afternoon, Wes and Ken.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, Carter.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President: Hi, Carter.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Just to follow up on that, Wes, when you look at TS, I mean, if you have someone else who doesn't have the same return hurdles or the same technology componentry focus that you do, is there a scenario where divesting a business as opposed to non-bids works, I mean there is obviously a lot of movement in that marketplace, a lot of changing business models in that marketplace, could that be part of the consideration as well or any color you can provide?
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: We always look at that full range, Carter, of portfolio options, but I will tell you in this case, what we see is the redeployment of people. We've got a great asset in that business of just extraordinary people, who can provide really good returns and provide really good outcomes for our customers as we better deploy them into these areas where we think there are better opportunities. So, my general bias in looking at a business like TS, where we do have such an amazing group of employees, is to just more effectively leverage that capability that we have into a place that makes a lot more sense for us to be, and, again, being mindful of it and respectful of our customers' needs, so that we are not causing any customers any grief in the process. So, that's generally how I see this going. As always, and you've seen us do this over the last number of years, if it's very, very clear that some part of our business would be better executed in the hands of another party, we're the first to step up and make that happen. But, in general, just giving you my impression of how I see things headed at TS, I have a bias towards redeploying the amazing people that we have in that organization to ensure that we can be on the better trajectory.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Can you quantify how much redeployment that it is as a percentage of the total?
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Not really, and I want to be careful that this doesn't come across as a huge sort of instantaneous transition of the business. We're just talking about the general vector that we see the business on. Again, I don't see a precipitous drop in any aspect of that business as we move into 2017. But when I compare the three businesses, AS and MS to TS, I would say that we're looking for a more near-term reflection of our growth opportunities at AS and MS and that will lag just a little bit in TS. That's the way I would frame it for you.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thanks Wes.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Carter.
Operator: And your next question is from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies.
Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC: Thank you very much. I want to turn the discussion a little bit towards some of these new innovative programs that you're starting to capitalize on. I think there is two and maybe three, one is SEWIP, second is JCREW and then third, it seems to me that you've probably won some space situational programs, and could you address sort of what you see, both with that portfolio and how to build on it, Wes?
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, thanks, Howard. I appreciate it. There is, as you point out, so much innovation that's occurring right now and attempting to insert some very new thinking into the way our customers are executing their missions. SEWIP Block III and JCREW are perfect examples of that. And we're really proud of those wins. And I'm especially proud of how the teams approached those areas. Those are reflections of some much of what we do in the company that takes a number of years of investment in advance to really generate the level of technology capability that we can demonstrate to the customers and show them that they can achieve and some of these cases, something that they didn't actually anticipate being able to do when they began thinking about the way they were going to formulate their mission capability. And in all of these areas as we are able to not only advance the technologies themselves, but better integrate these rapidly-moving technology spaces, we're creating these types of outcomes for our customers. And I'm especially excited and proud about that. SEWIP III, you mentioned a really good example of how the Navy is thinking aggressively ahead on electronic warfare. And, it needs to, given the complexity of the threat environment that the Navy is going to be facing as they move forward. And, in JCREW, if you looked at what we've been able to do over the years in our communications space through the application of software-defined capability and the ability to integrate a lot of different ways of operating into singular devices, I think that's a really good example of that outcome. You mentioned space. And space is an area that I really think we're on the beginning next steps of a change in the way of looking at the space portfolio for the nation. For years, we operated our space assets with sort of the perspective that we were in some sort of sanctuary in space, and didn't really have to worry about threat. And that's changed dramatically over the last few years. You've heard a number of senior officials in government talk about that shift in the thinking and that understanding. And, consequently, as we go forward, I think just about all of the space missions that are going to need to be recapitalized are going to be recapitalized with those concerns in mind, which inevitably moves the architecture of those missions in the direction of the application of higher-end technologies, which is what we do. So, I think there will be quite a few very good opportunities for both our company and the companies with whom we partner in addressing these new needs in space. And we are investing to make sure that we're in the right place on that and forming the right partnerships to ensure that we can together bring the capabilities our customers are going to need. So, there's actually quite a bit of work that's going on in our company and across our industry right now on the higher end of these technologies to ensure that our customers are going to be able to get what they need from us.
Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC: So, if I interpret that, there is some study contracts that have moved forward and you're part of that?
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: There are, sort of across the board on a lot of these things, much of the advanced study work, as you might imagine, is classified, so we're not able to talk very much about that, but I would just say there is quite a bit of effort and energy that our customers are putting into making sure that the application of these advanced technologies really does enable them to differentiate their war-fighting capabilities.
Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC: Thank you very much.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Howard.
Operator: Your next question is from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yes. Thank you very much. So in your first quarter 10-Q, I think you identified $75 million difference between what you were assuming in recovery on equitable adjustment claims versus what your claim was. And I think you alluded to an REA in your current 10-Q. Could you give us the status of those first? Were both of those two REA's from the first quarter settled here in the second quarter? And was the one mentioned in your Q here that you settled in July, is that included in these numbers? And if so, you know, what was the recovery? Thank you.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President: Cai, thanks for the question. On the REAs, let me kind of cover it broadly. The one REA that we discussed in the 10-Q was resolved in July. It was reflected in the numbers and does not result in a material impact for a disclosure in the financials or the 10-Q. In terms of the remaining REAs, there is a remaining balance that we believe is not material for disclosure, working through that, or those, in due course and don't expect any material issues arising out of that, certainly to the downside. And to the extent there's an immaterial upside, we'll include that in future 10-Qs or 10-Ks, as the timing is right.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: And then, you mentioned also in the Q that you have, I guess, another potential $40 million or so tax pickup. Could you basically explain what's that about? And what has to be triggered to allow you to realize that?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President: There is a number of outstanding tax audits, Cai, that continue through the process. And some roll their way out and/or realizes. We saw 2007 through 2011 was this quarter and other audits, be they Federal or state, or other international jurisdictions, sometimes roll their way into what we call the early warning disclosure in terms of what changes we could see in the next 12 months. So, it's just kind of a rolling inventory of a large number of claims and audits that our tax team works very hard to stay on top of and maximize our cash tax benefits, while always making sure we're in strict compliance with the tax laws and regulations.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question is from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.
Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks very much and good afternoon. In Mission Systems, I think you noted in the 10-Q that the backlog was down slightly year-to-date. I think after the first quarter, it had been up a bit. I wonder if you could talk about the order environment there and the possibility of ending out the year with that backlog higher.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Seth, I think that one of the complications of backlog is it's really hard to analyze on a quarterly basis. And we certainly, being kind of a longer cycle businesses at AS and MS, we do see the impact of – I wouldn't call it necessarily seasonal change in the backlog, but kind of fluctuations in terms of increases as large orders come in and decreases as you kind of burn those down. So, I would say it's not unusual, pretty consistent with our historical timing of booking awards and our backlog balances. And that's one of the reasons that we don't guide on book-to-bill is it's just, in a long cycle business, it can be a bit lumpy, and dependent on timing of getting awards in the door and when those contracts are signed and negotiated.
Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay, understood. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.
Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: Thank you.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Hunter. Good morning.
Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: Hey. How are you? So, CapEx, the low end came up by about $100 million. Well, not about; it came up by $100 million. And, I think you said the building purchase was about $240 million versus I think the prior placeholder was like $300 million. So, what's driving the increase there? And, as you think about the next couple years, two, three years out, are you finding that there's maybe some unanticipated required investments with some of the ramping development work that maybe means CapEx stays a little more elevated than maybe some people were expecting, or you guys were originally expecting, maybe closer to the $1 billion level going forward for the next few years? Thank you.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President: No problem, Hunter. I would say that I don't think that this – the profile of the CapEx for 2016 is surprising to us. We fully expected that we'd have the facilities in the early half of the year. And we've been executing on that, as Wes mentioned. We've got a couple other major projects that are working their way through the system. And we fully expected that some of that would be second half-loaded. So, we see a higher level of CapEx on the non-facilities side of things in the second half of the year. And, we fully expect to be within the range of $800 million to $1 billion. In terms of the future CapEx requirements, I think what we've talked about is, is that we expect to stay elevated from our historical amount, if you look back a number of years, for a few more years. And what we're seeing today, I don't see any significant change in our previous expectation as to where we are today on that outlook. So I think we would continue to say not necessarily the number of facility actions in front of us as we saw the first half of this year, but we do see as we grow the business and we're investing for the future, profitable growth that we see in front of us, we'll see an elevated level for a few more years, but, no change from where we've been in terms of the longer-term outlook.
Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Robert Spingarn from Credit Suisse.
Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Good afternoon.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President: Hi, Robert.
Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): If you'll indulge me, I was going to try and tie two things together here into one question related to LRIP 9 and 10. And, the first component is the F-35 margin, which, Ken, I think last quarter, you mentioned was below where it might be relative to its level of maturity, the program's level of maturity, at this stage. And then, the other part is the logistics side of the equation, which you both talked about a few questions ago. With this LRIP 9, 10 deal, I guess this is to you, Ken. Are you getting where you want to get on margins? And then, how should we think about this Blueprint for Affordability? And then, separately, the sustainment cost reduction initiative. What are the anatomy of these programs? Are they real initiatives that you've cooperative with a customer or are they euphemisms for price decreases?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President: Let me start on the margin side and LRIP 9, 10. And then, I'll turn it over to Wes on the Blueprint for Sustainability. And I can comment briefly on Blueprint for Affordability, as I was a bit involved in that when I was in my previous role at the AS sector. In terms of F-35 margin, I would say that, yes, in fact, the margin rates we're realizing on that program is not what we expect at this level of maturity. We're talking about LRIPs 9 and 10 moving into full rate production, and we would expect that the margin would be a bit higher than where it is today. That being said, the negotiation of each lot is only the first step in that process, and you've got to perform in order to realize the margin. So, we've been able to work hard with Lockheed Martin to get to an MOU on LRIP 9 and 10 for AS, and we were previously there on the other sectors. And, now it's a matter of performing and delivering the margin that we expect out of that program. From a BFA perspective, we did invest along with BAE and Lockheed Martin in the BFA through I guess that was in 2012-2013 timeframe. And, I would say that we've been making good progress on that working with the industry team and the government through that process. Any other questions on BFA, I'd refer you to Lockheed Martin for any other comment.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Let me just comment broadly on the blueprint investments, because just the tone of your question, I think, perhaps conveyed a little bit of a negative view on them that I think is inaccurate. These investments, they are team investments that are focused on helping our customer get cost out. And as we do that, they have inherent in them a return mechanism for the company. So, this is not sort of a side-swipe at some way of reducing our margin or something. This is an overt decision by the industry team to come together, to work on ways to actually get the cost, the unit costs in the case of the BFAs and then the sustainment cost in terms of the BFS, to get the cost structure into a place where our customers can afford more of the capability. So, from an industry perspective, we are only doing this, because we see a benefit to the program and ultimately an economic benefit to those who are participants in the program. And it's a win-win, because the government, our customers, get an economic benefit from these investments as well, and have worked very closely with us in both structuring the investment strategies and programs, and on ensuring that there is a good return mechanism. So we see them as very positive mechanisms, very supportive of the program objectives. And I think it has been a really good reflection on the partnership approach that we have together across the companies on F-35, that we're able to make something innovative like this work so well. So, I'm very proud of these blueprint initiatives. I think they're a very good thing.
Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Wes, I think that make sense. The part I'm curious about is, I would think that you and Lockheed and BAE are working on these sorts of things in any event to get the cost down, and I'm just curious as to the role that the customer plays here in catalyzing this.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: So, what's neat about the blueprint process, and you're right. Of course, we're always working together to figure out ways of taking the cost down. It really does create a really good team environment with the customer, because in some of these areas, they have to make decisions to do things a little bit differently.
Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): I see.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: So, it's a very good way of crystallizing a very effective joint process with not only the partners, but the customer to benefit the program. So, I think it's a good idea, and I'm glad to see us moving forward with these.
Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): And just on the logistics side, sustainment side, just based on what was said earlier on other programs and then we have this BFS, I guess it is on F-35, are there different flavors here of sustainment programs? It sounds like some have become LPTA and maybe others aren't?
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: All right. There is probably enough variability across sustainment programs as there is the number of sustainment programs. There is a lot of different models that are utilized by different customers, depending on how much work the government itself wants to do, how much they want to contract out, the nature of the economic relationships they want to create. So, it's a marketplace with a lot of different business models. And I think that's appropriate, because we have many different types of systems at different stages of their lifecycle with different levels of technology, different desires for modernization. So, it's a very interesting and dynamic marketplace.
Stephen C. Movius - Corporate Vice President and Treasurer, Vice President Investor Relations: Hey, Robert, we're going to cut it off at this point in time. So, I'm going to turn it over to Wes for final comments.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: All right, well, thanks, Steve. Let me just wrap up by thanking our team again for developing an approach over these last number of years that has allowed us to consistently deliver solid results. I think this quarter was another good demonstration of the team's focus and commitment on performance. But also the team is doing such a great job in positioning us so well for the, not only the remainder of this year, but for the longer-term and for working closely with our customers to satisfy their needs as we go forward. So, thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today, and also thanks for your continuing interest in our company.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's First Quarter 2016 Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. My name is Robin and I will be your operator today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Steve Movius, Treasurer and Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Movius, please proceed.
Steve Movius: Thanks Robin, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's First Quarter 2016 Conference Call. In addition to filing our first quarter 10-Q this morning, we also filed a form 8-K to recap the presentation of our consolidated financial statements for years 2013 through 2015 and the disclosures in certain portions of our 2015 10-K to reflect the changes in the company's organizational structure and reportable segments. We've also recast certain 2015 quarterly information as provided in schedule four of today's earnings release. Before we start, please understand that matters discussed on today's call constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which are detailed in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risk factors may cause actual company results to differ materially. Matters discussed on today's call may also include non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled in the earnings release. On our call today is our Chairman, CEO and President Wes Bush; and Ken Bedingfield, our CFO. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Wes.
Wes Bush: Thanks Steve. Good afternoon, everyone and thanks for joining us today. This was a good quarter and a strong start for the year. So I want to thank our employees for their unwavering focus on performance. Our team continues to execute well and position the company to achieve profitable growth over the long term. In the first quarter under our realign structure, all three businesses delivered strong results. To remind everyone, we undertook this realignment to better-focus our innovation and affordability efforts to provide our customers enhanced mission capability at a reduced cost. To find more effectively aligning and aggregating our products and services businesses, we enabled greater operational synergy and enhanced our ability to develop, produce, sustain and upgrade our products over their entire life cycle. Sales for the quarter were comparable to last year at $6 billion. First quarter segment operating margin rate was 11.8% and supports our outlook for the year. Before the tax benefit, first quarter earnings per share would have been $2.59, a 7.5% increase over last year's first quarter. Including the tax benefit, earnings per share totaled $3.03. Cash from operations was the use of $60 million, substantially better than last year's first quarter. Free cash flow was the use of $358 million and includes capital spending of $298 million. The first priority of our deployment strategy continues to be investing in our businesses to position the company for the future. We continue to return cash to shareholders. During the quarter, we repurchased $1.5 million shares. This quarter's share, we purchased pace, supports our guidance of the 6% reduction in weighted average diluted share count this year. At the end of the first quarter, approximately $4 billion remained on our share repurchase authorization. For the year, we continue to expect sales will range between $23.5 billion and $24 billion with free-cash flow of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion which reflects strong cash from operations and investments for the future. As a result of the tax benefit and first quarter performance, we are raising our 2016 EPS guidance to a range of $10.40 to $10.70. First is our prior guidance range of $9.90 to $10.20. In addition to this quarter's solid financial results, I'd also like to highlight some operational achievements. At Mission Systems, our Saber Radar started flight testing for the US F-16 modernization program. Saber brings fifth generation radar capability to the F-16 by leveraging hardware and software commonality between our F-22 and F-35 AS Radars. AMS will begin delivering Saber for international F-16 customers later this year. Also during the quarter, our BCN high altitude airborne communications gateway achieved a 100,000 combat flying hours and continues to provide critical communications capabilities by translating and distributing imagery, video, voice and data to enhance communications and awareness on the ground and in the air. At Aerospace Systems, we successfully flew a Cyrus 2 Sensor on a Global Hawk, the first time this sensor has been demonstrated on a high altitude unmanned aircraft. Later this year, we expect to fly additional sensors on Global Hawk and we expect that Global Hawk will demonstrate its flexibility for supporting a wide variety of U.S. Air Force operational requirements. Triton, the maritime variant of Global Hawk continued to make good progress in its operational assessments this quarter. We look forward to a positive milestone sea decision that would transition Triton to low-rate initial production later this year. The highlight during the quarter was getting back to work on the B-21 program. We're pleased at the GAO confirmed that the Air Force conducted an extremely thorough selection process and chose the most capable and affordable solution. The next generation Bomber is critical of the national security. It will allow significant forced projection anywhere in the world in an anti-axis aerial denial environment. We are absolutely committed to outstanding execution on this program and we are off to a strong start. Northrop Grumman is a technology-driven company. Our team is pursuing innovation and breakthrough technologies to support the world's most technologically advanced military. A successful partnership with our customers helps to ensure military superiority. This partnership requires innovation, affordability, investment and performance. Investment on our part through IRAD and capital spending is critical and performance on our part is equally important. We are increasing investment through IRAD and capital expenditures as our opportunities that has grown. And we are committed to delivering very good returns on these investments. Over the past several years, we've demonstrated that as a company, we can't perform during a challenging down cycle. That focus is even more important as we began work on important new development programs and continue to position the company for profitable growth over the long term. To conclude, it was a good quarter and a solid start to 2016. Our value proposition remains the same: drive strong sustainable performance, generate cash and effectively deploy that cash. We continue to believe this is the right strategy and that it positioned us for continued long term sustainable value creation for our shareholders, our customers and our employees. Now I'll turn the call over to Ken for a more detailed discussion of our results and guidance. Ken?
Ken Bedingfield: Thanks, Wes, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to add my thanks to our team on their continued outstanding work. Today I'll briefly review our first quarter results and provide a little more detail on our 2016 guidance. But before I do, let me provide some more detail on our realignment. I'll start with Aerospace Systems. The Azusa based military and civil space business formerly inherited to ES is now part of AS and the electronic attack business formerly in AS is now part of Mission Systems. AS continues to focus on demand aircraft, autonomous systems and space business areas. At Mission Systems, elements of our former information systems portfolio that were focused on sophisticated systems architecture and engineering including both advanced software and hardware capabilities are now combined with our former electronic systems portfolio. This creates a more integrated business to support development of new capabilities for our military and intelligence customers around the globe. Within Mission Systems, we offer products and services in three major business areas: sensors and processing, cyber and ISR and advanced capabilities. Sensors and processing is the largest of the three and is focused on land and airborne radar, EW, C-2 and second efforts. Cyber and ISR encompasses a combination of work from the two legacy sectors including full spectrum cyber systems and ISR collection, processing and exploitation. Advanced capabilities provides integration and interoperability of net-enabled battle management, sensors, targeting and surveillance systems, air and missile defense, C-2 and global battle space awareness. Technology services combines the service elements of our former information systems sector with the former technical services. The new TS includes our health IT work and a majority of our civil work. Technology services' primary focus is on life cycle support and modernization of systems and platforms as well as advanced training. The business areas of within TS are global logistics and modernization, advanced defense services and system modernization and services. Turning to our financial results; our first quarter ETS included an $80 million or $0.44 per share tax benefit. We early-adopted an accounting standard update that requires recognition of excess tax benefits and efficiencies related to share base payments as either income tax expense or benefit in the TNL depending on whether the stock compensation awards best at, above, or below the grant price. In addition, the update requires these items now be presented in operating cash flow rather than as a financing item. Even before the benefit of the accounting update, we had a solid quarter. Turning to the sectors; aerospace Systems sales rose 3% to approximately $2.6 billion due to higher volume for manned aircraft and autonomous systems. A manned aircraft, we continue to ramp up on our E2D program including production for Japan's first aircraft. Higher F-35 sales also contributed as we delivered 13 units this quarter versus nine in last year's first quarter. Increases on these programs were partially offset by lower volume for the D-2 as well as fewer FAA team deliveries and in the prior period. As expected, we delivered seven FAA teams this quarter versus nine in last year's first quarter. Higher revenue autonomous systems included higher volume for Global Hawk and Triton. Global Hawk volume reflects the upgrade activities Wes mentioned earlier as well as production activity on Korea's Global Hawk. Triton volume continues to increase as we progress toward low-rate initial production. Space sales were comparable to the prior year period. Aerospace Systems operating income decline compared to last year's first quarter, an operating margin rate with 11.1%. First quarter operating income reflects lower margins on several manned aircraft programs with the primary driver being the timing of risk reductions. For 2016, we continue to expect Aerospace sales in the low $10 billion range with a mid to high 11% margin rate. No change from prior guidance. Mission Systems' first quarter sales were comparable to the prior year at approximately $2.7 billion. Operating income increased 3% and operating margin rate expanded 40 basis points to 13.1%. Sales reflect lower volume for cyber and ISR programs, partially offset by higher volume for sensors and processing and advanced capabilities programs. For 2016, we continue to expect Mission Systems sales in the high $10 billion range with an operating margin rate in the mid to high 12% range. No change from prior guidance. Technology services sales decline 4%, principally due to continued ramp-down on the ICBM program as well as lower volume for restricted programs. Operating income declined in-line with sales and operating margin rate was comparable to last year at 10.4%. For 2016, we continue to expect sales in a mid-$4 billion range with a margin rate of approximately 10%. No change from prior guidance. As Wes mentioned, our segment operating margin rate for the quarter was 11.8%, which is a good start towards our full-year guidance of high 11% for the year. Total operating margin rate of 12.4% was strong and we continue to expect total operating margin rate of about 12% for the full year. Our net FAS/CAS adjustment is unchanged at $275 million for the year and we continue to expect unallocated corporate expenses of about $200 million. As a result of the $80 million tax benefit, our effective tax rate declined to 17.8% for the quarter and for the full year, we now expect an effective tax rate of approximately 27%. Our updated 2016 earnings per share guidance of $10.40 to $10.70 reflects a $0.50 increase to the top and bottom of the range and continues to assume our weighted average diluted shares decline by approximately 6% to about $181 million shares. We continue to expect 2016 free cash flow to range between $1.5 and $1.8 billion. Our free cash flow guidance anticipates capital spending of $700 million to $1 billion in 2016. First quarter capital expenditures totaled $298 million and include $159 million for the purchase of the building previously leased by Mission Systems. In addition to the building we purchased in the first quarter, we expect to close on another facility in the second quarter. I'll conclude my remarks with a discussion on awards and backlog. During the first quarter of 2016, the company's total backlog increased and reflects higher backlog at Aerospace Systems and Mission Systems in a modest decline in backlog at technology services. The company recorded various awards during the quarter including a portion of the B-21 Long Range Strike Bomber Program. We intend to report backlog and awards on a full-year basis for the company and each sector in our 2016 annual report on Form 10-K. We also intend to provide qualitative information on a quarterly basis similar to this quarter's disclosure until year-end. Before we begin Q&A, I would also remind everyone that beyond the statements in our prepared remarks, we have no additional information to share on the B21 award or the program in general. I think we're ready for Q&A. Steve?
Steve Movius: Thanks, Ken. As we open up the call for Q&A, we ask each participant to limit themselves to a single question. Robin?
Operator: [Operator instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.
Noah Poponak: Hi. Good afternoon, everyone.
Ken Bedingfield: Hey, Noah.
Noah Poponak: Wes and Ken, I wanted to try to ask about margins going forward and I just heard the directive on one part. So this is kind of a multi-one part that I'll try to wrap into one. But we get a lot of questions from investors about - we've seen all the new business wins and we think the top line can grow, but we hear concern that margins will go down because of all that new business. When I map it out, it seems pretty likely your F-35 business margins will improve. When I map out your own man business, it looks like margins can improve pretty significantly there because they're such a big mix shift to procurement from development and too international. So I think people kind of get concerned at the Bomber being a new large development program will be pretty dilutive to the margin. But when I look at it because Bomber stays so much smaller than those other programs, total unmanned F-35 and some others for a while, I actually arrive at the total company having segment margin expansion pretty much every year for the next three to five years. I know you probably don't want to give specific annual guidance, but just directionally, is that in a scenario analysis? Am I missing anything with the margin trajectory?
Ken Bedingfield: Noah, great question and I wouldn't say that you're missing anything in terms of analysis of the fact that we've got a lot of moving parts. We do have a well-diversified portfolio and we've got some business - you're right - should be driving towards some higher margins. We have been realizing margins on F-35 that are below what we expect for a program at that level of maturity and we certainly expect as we move towards more mature production, that we would realize higher margins in that area. Autonomous Systems, we do see some international business that's moving into production as well as Triton hopefully moving out of development and into LRIP. So we would expect to the potential first on higher margins there. That being said, we do have a fair amount of development work that we're taking on whether that's B-21 or some of the other strategic items that Wes mentioned - whether that's Saber, or SEWIP, or G/ATOR or others. In some respects, the question is what's going to move first in a web velocity among those various moving parts? I would say that overall, certainly some pressures on margin rates as development programs grow, but as you mention, we do have more mature production that's also going to be growing in terms of dollars. The other one I probably should have mentioned is E-2 that's now into multi-year production. So we'll continue to work on it. I see it as being range-bound into a reasonable range. We have the opportunity to continue to perform and we also need to work to try to offset the pressure that will come from the development margins.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned, Bernstein.
Doug Harned: Yes, thank you.
Wes Bush: Hey, Doug. Good afternoon.
Doug Harned: I'm interested in Mission Systems. You made the comment that you're seeing this quarter lower sales for ISR in cyber, higher for sensors, but if you look forward and you look at the pieces of that business, can you talk about where you see the growth trends? Because that doesn't sound like its representative of where this business is really headed over the next few years. Could you comment on that?
Wes Bush: Doug, its Wes. Let me just give you a kind of sense of how I see things with respect to our Mission Systems business. Our strategy in putting the parts of the Legacy electronic systems and Legacy information systems, business together that we combined to create MS was precisely around - I think what you're getting to, which is growth - there's opportunity in that market space over the longer time by integrating those capabilities together in innovative ways that I think will help position us quite nicely to do exactly what our customer needs us to do, which is to give a more capability at lower cost. When I think about the core product lines in there, the areas that I see as having really good growth opportunities, clearly communications, the work that we do in creating software define capabilities for communications is extensive and we're continuing to see a great demand in that area. Certainly combat avionics is a big part of the growth equation in MS. Cyber, as we've talked about for some time is another area that's growing well and I think you're all familiar with the fact that we have not only had a good IRCM business for some time, but last year with our capture of the crypto contract that added to our portfolio of opportunity in that countermeasures business. All of those areas are I think examples of the types of businesses where we see really good growth prospects going forward with MS. Ken, was there anything you'd like to add on that?
Ken Bedingfield: I think you hit it on the head on that one, Wes. I think that's the right answer to the question.
Wes Bush: All right.
Operator: Your next question, from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.
Seth Siefman: Thanks very much and good morning.
Ken Bedingfield: Hi, Seth.
Seth Siefman: Hi. I just wanted to ask about the dividend. Based on what you've done in the past, it would seem that you guys have an increase coming up potentially on next month and part as a function of the rise in the share price, the yield is down to I think about 1.6% to 1.7%, and how you think about where you want that to be going forward?
Ken Bedingfield: Seth, thanks for the question. We do historically review our dividend for whether there will be an increase at the main meeting of the boards, so that is upcoming. I would say that we've had a history of dividend increases for a number of years and we will consider that between now and that meeting. I would just comment that in terms of chasing dividend yield, we don't make a practice of chasing yield. I would note that our yield is lower than some of our peers primarily because of stock price performance as opposed to dividend historical increases. We tend to think of dividend in terms of a payout ratio and that payout ratio being pension-adjusted net earnings and we believe if you look at our dividend in that light, you'll see that we're in a competitive range within our peer group. That's the light in which we'll continue to analyze this for the foreseeable future.
Operator: And your next question is from the line of Robert Stallard with the Royal Bank of Canada.
Robert Stallard: Thanks so much. Good afternoon.
Ken Bedingfield: Hi, Rob.
Wes Bush: Hi, Rob.
Robert Stallard: A Bomber's question. First of all on the B-2, you know that it was a bit lower in Q1. Is this a trend or can we expect this program to remain steady going forward? And secondly on the B-21 - I know we're not allowed to ask you a question, but I'll try - have you had any indication from the Air Force that they will be easing up on the classified structure of this program? Thank you.
Ken Bedingfield: Rob, your first question on the B-2, I would say I do not believe the first quarter volume indicates a trend. This is one that has a number of aspects to the program and various pieces of business that run through there. So I think it's primarily just timing. Modernization more so has a bit more of fluctuation than the baseline maintenance and operations business. As far as the B-21, I wouldn't be able to comment. I think that's something we'd leave for the Air Force to determine income.
Operator: And your next question is from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Ron Epstein: Yay! Good morning/afternoon, guys.
Ken Bedingfield: Hey, Ron.
Ron Epstein: It looks like in Mission Systems, you guys said that the volume in margins were down for cyber and ISR. It seems like the past few years, both of those areas were growth drivers for the segment. Is that decline sort of a quarterly thing, or are we seeing a shift in customer priority?
Wes Bush: I think it's important to be clear about what that was within that part of the business and I know it's a little bit difficult to track what's in the pieces quite yet, given that we're brand new in putting out a description of how we're categorizing the different elements of the business and I would direct you to look at the 8-K that just got filed to help better understand that. But the thing that was really driving that this quarter, the lower sales and the part of the business that we call cyber and ISR was actually a lower volume on the Counter-Narcoterrorism Technology Program, CNTPO, which is an IDIQ type of contract with different task quarters that's been sort of fluctuating up and down over the years. So, I would not describe that in any way as a core part of the way we characterize cyber or our ISR activities. That happens to be a part of what got put into that portion of the business that we described with that label. So we don't see any negative trends at all in sort of the core cyber or ISR elements of our business. But CNTPO with respect to some of the IDIQ task force had some fluctuation that drove that outcome.
Operator: And your next question is from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.
Cai von Rumohr: Yes. Thank you so much. Did I miss the backlog numbers? Are we going to get restated backlog numbers for your three new businesses?
Ken Bedingfield: Cai, just a comment on the backlog. We are presenting backlog on a quarterly basis at this point on a qualitative level by sector. So we did provide information that AS backlog is up, MS backlog is up and technology services is moderately down. I'd refer you to the 8-K for the details that are in there with respect to backlog.
Operator: And your next question is from Carter Copeland with Barclays.
Carter Copeland: Hey, good afternoon, Wes and Ken.
Wes Bush: Hi, Carter.
Carter Copeland: Just a clarification question. I noticed there was no B-21 disclosure in the AS comments. Is that due to the programs classification or because of its materiality? I guess just clarify that for us and then a higher level question for you, Wes, and it's about sort of managing growth and performance simultaneously. You got a lot of programs ramping and you got a lot of additional opportunities on the horizon, but clearly executing on the cost performance on several of these programs and none more so than the B-21 is huge. So, I wondered if you might give us some insight into how you're thinking about how you managed that given the history of several of these programs and the importance to the customer of maintaining the cost targets that you've laid out there.
Wes Bush: Yes, Carter, thanks for the question. With respect to B-21, the disclosures are what they are. We've got the material and what we have released that we're going to be able to disclose on it. I really appreciate your question on growth and performance because it is a topic that we've been spending quite a bit of time on within our company and not just recently having one, a number of activities to something that we've been working hard to be prepared for a long period of time; and the actions that we've taken over the last several years with respect to our focus on execution performance on our programs, I think is serving us very well on that regard. I know a lot of folks sort of look at the margin expansion that we had over the last few years and thought, “Well, that's just cost reduction.” Well, clearly cost discipline is an important part of it, but I will tell you the big driver for all of those margin expansions was actually better performance, better programmed execution and that discipline in the company has steadily been increasing and it is the focal point for just about every engagement we have with our leadership team in terms of the actions that we need to be taking collectively to further enhance our ability to execute. So when we look at our new programs, programs that we're taking on, we approach each of them from the perspective of how do we manage the inherent risk that goes with a new development activity? First and foremost, that means being very clear about what all those risk really are, getting them out on the table as transparently as possible for all of us to focus on; and then secondly, in short [ph] that we have very strong risk management capabilities and practices baked in for everything that we take on. That's the discipline that we're driving in our execution. In addition to our work and in terms of being able to execute more effectively, I would say that there are some very positive trends in our customer community that are helping in this regard. And one of the ones that I would point out is requirement stability. There's a lot of work that's been done over the last few years as a result of the efforts both at the OST level and in each of the services to enhance the acquisition team's ability to hold the requirement stable. Because we all know when it comes to these development programs, a major source of cost growth and schedule expansion historically has been requirements and stability. We simply as a nation can't afford that anymore. In order to execute well, we need to be able to keep the requirements stable, we need to of course drive the execution with great discipline from the companies and I have to give the services and OST a lot of credit for their attention to requirement stability. I think that's going to help a lot. Now, there's a third component to this that is also really important and that is funding stability. Given the volatility that we've seen in the budgeting process over the last few years, this is an area where we need congress to help as well. We need that stability to be able to execute well. And when we get funding volatility on programs, that too can ripple the outcomes. So this is a matter of focus across the board and it requires all the players both the industry, the customer community and the congress to play their role in making this program successful and we're certainly determined to do our part. I've been encouraged by what I've seen both in the Pentagon and on The Hill with respect to the various defense committees recognizing the importance of all of these aspects to ensure we can execute well. But it's clearly right at the very top of the list of actions that we have within our company to drive good solid execution.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel from Jefferies.
Howard Rubel: Thank you.
Wes Bush: Hi, Howard.
Howard Rubel: Good. I'm going to ask the per se question, Wes and go back to backlog again. Sorry. But it's very unusual for an aerospace company not to report a backlog number and could you go through the logic as to why you won't provide interim numbers?
Ken Bedingfield: Howard, it's Ken here. At this point, I think the only comment I would make is to refer you to the 8-K and just to remind you that we do intend to provide annual backlog data at the entire company and at the sector levels in our 2016 annual report on form 10-K.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi.
Jason Gursky: Hey, good morning guys, or good afternoon. One of the just quick clarification as well and a lot, on the clarification was mentioned the B-2 volumes look like they're a bit of lumpy this year. Can you give us a percent of what you expect them to be in 2016 relative to 2015 growth, but - and what the expectation was going forward. And then the bigger question is can you just talk about again for - it's all the talk within minuses from a revenue perspective in the aerospace segment that you might see over the next several years. We know about F-35, Long Range Strike we'll obviously see some growth, but are there any other pluses and minuses that we should all be cognizant of as we go out to profile in that business?
Ken Bedingfield: Jason, I would say that in terms of the B-2 volume question upfront, in terms of the lumpiness, I think that's just kind of a quarter-by-quarter thing. We do manage this business for the long term and no concerns about the B-2 or where it is. I would say overall, we expect B-2 volume to be relatively consistent in 2016 with where it was in 2015, somewhere in the $700 million range in terms of sales volume. In terms of the second part of the question on pluses and minuses in revenues, at aerospace, I would say again a fair number of moving parts. In terms of what's declining, probably the biggest piece of decline would be F-18. As that program ramps down, I think we're down to two per month sort of delivery schedule. The other areas where we've seen a bit of decline in 2016 versus last year would be non-restricted space particularly AEHF, James Webb Space Telescope. In terms of adds to volume, we do expect that F35 will start to ramp here at some point and we're looking forward to when that occurs. The B-21 Long Range Strike Bomber is certainly something that we would see as ramping here. And then as I mentioned, the E2D program that is now into the multi-year production, we talked about Triton moving into LRIP and then I would say a number of restricted activities.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.
Myles Walton: Thanks. Good afternoon.
Ken Bedingfield: Hey, Miles.
Myles Walton: Wes, I was intrigued to see the company tie 30% of its annual incentive comp to pension adjusted net income growth for the first time this year. Your guidance would imply that it doesn't grow this year. So conceptually, this year - is one question, but then also, I guess you're now comfortable that the company and maybe the industry is centered in the back drop where it's not just a capital return, but there's actually underlying year-on-your compounding pension adjusted net income growth?
Wes Bush: I appreciate the question. It's kind of a reflection of the way we think about motivating our team. Clearly, if you look at the budgets that have been approved, '16, well, in terms of the investment accounts domestically here were up about 14% over 15% and '17, well, not quite as robust in terms of the present's budget is still up noticeably from where we have been in '15. Some question obviously about whether or not the congress can move beyond this two-year process of getting past the budget control act or the sequester and get us into a more stable long term factor. But if you do look at the present budget, it puts the investment accounts in a more robust position. I think you might argue whether or not it's robust enough, you know what's going on around the globe. Given that, from a company perspective, we see our portfolio as being very well-positioned to take advantage of that healthier environment to better-support our customers with products and services they really need to address that tough threat environment that's out there. So we are looking at that aspect of our incentive plan even though it's stated on an annual basis as something that we are integrating more into the thinking in the company and the way that we're going to incentivize ourselves over time to make sure that we're translating this improved market opportunity space into actual increases in net income over a period of years. So we tend to use our annual incentive plan as a way of ensuring alignment within the company around a way we're thinking about what we need to get done. You might recall a few years ago when we were taking on this initial thrust to change our outcomes on operating margin rates. We set that up incrementally over a course of several years, but it was a very strong communication within the company around this as our area of focus and this is the outcome we need to achieve and it was very effective. I expect that as we go forward and focus on this transition in the market environment, that we'll be able to generate a very positive outcome by ensuring that our team is focused on growing the bottom line, not just the top line. We need to make sure we'd bring the bottom line with us as we're growing over time. I would not describe this as an either/or on capital deployment or net income growth. We do anticipate maintaining a very strong focus on returning cash to shareholders. How we do that over the course of time always varies a little bit. But I think you've heard both Ken and I say on our recent calls, share repurchase will continue to be a very important part of our strategy as well as having a competitive dividend from a payout ratio perspective. We look at all of these elements of value creation as being very important, but I think you put your finger on it the right way in your question as we look at the changing market conditions, it will be important for us to incentivize our team to make sure that we are growing that bottom line as well as the top line.
Ken Bedingfield: Miles, if I can just add to that. I would say that I think Wes' point around the trajectory, it was important. What we've done here is really set a baseline in 2016 from where there's a trajectory for net income to grow from. So do not necessarily read this as 2016 net income as growing from '15, but we've set a base line that we're looking to grow from as we move forward.
Operator: Your next question is from David Strauss from UBS.
David Strauss: Good afternoon.
Wes Bush: Hi, David.
Ken Bedingfield: Hey, David.
David Strauss: Another question on F-35, can you just update us where you are in terms of locking in the various contracts? And then Ken, a question around revenue recognition. I think you're on units of [ph] now the updated revenue recognition standard, how could that impact you on F-35 and if so, when? Thanks.
Ken Bedingfield: All right. Great. Thanks, David, for the question. I would say a couple of things. I guess first to answer your question where we stand on contracts, just a reminder we do have four main contracts on F-35 with Lockheed-Martin. We've got the center fuselage, the radar, distributed aperture system and the CNI communications navigation identification suite and various aspects of those are in negotiation with Lockheed Martin, but I would say that what folks tend to think of as our main piece, that being the center fuselage - which is our single largest contract - we are negotiated through LRIP 8, continuing to work hard to get LRIPs 9 and 10 negotiated. Just working through the details with those with our customer. In terms of the question on the REV/REX standard, very good question. We are on units of delivery for all four of our contracts on F-35 and we also have other units of delivery contracts - F-18 is one and some others within Mission Systems. We do expect that when we adapt the new REV/REX standard which should be in the first quarter of 2018, we would transition from units of delivery on each of those contracts to a cost-to-cost method of revenue recognition. That being said, we do not expect - and looking at the profile of those contracts that are on units of delivery and where they're going to be in their life cycle, we don't expect that the revenue recognized in that period should be significantly different from what would be recognized on the units of delivery basis. The reason for that is that the cost to repute ultimately is pretty consistent with the unit flow that we see. So there could be some impact and there certainly will be some impact, but we have not at this point seen that as particularly significant for the adaption of that new standard in 2018.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo Securities.
Sam Pearlstein: Good afternoon.
Wes Bush: Hey, Sam.
Sam Pearlstein: I guess more for Ken, but can you talk a little bit more about the capital spending? You had the $150 million or so building that you purchased this first quarter, it sounds like there's another one about to be teed up. Can you just help me understand how to think about what that means for the appreciation expense. Does it mean cap ex is going to be near the high-end versus the low-end this year in terms of just now that you've actually executed some of those plans?
Ken Bedingfield: All right. Let me see if I can address those in maybe three pieces. I guess the first part is capital spending in the first quarter. What I would say is yes, the building certainly was a significant piece of that. The other piece of it, I think is just continued projects that we've been working through in 2015 and you can think of those as generally being related to either some of the centers of excellence's work that we've been undertaking here in the last couple of years. As well as some that are programmatic in nature, in general supporting multiple programs whether it's programs that are in production and we're seeing some relatively solid production numbers in front of us where we determine we can invest. A great example of that would be the St. Augustine Aircraft Integration Center where we invested ahead of the E2D multi-year program because we saw that there was a relatively stable base of production for a relative long period of time. I would say that some of it is the buildings that we've talked about and some of it is just kind of continued spend on the existing projects, much of which is either centers of excellence or program-related. But for the most part, if they're a program, they support multiple programs and not just a single. In terms of depreciation, what I would say is that we don't look at our indirect rates on a piece-by-piece or line-by-line basis. We've managed our indirect as a piece of our total cost and just because depreciation may be going up doesn't mean that we have an excuse to let our indirect rates increase. So we'll manage and we'll continue to manage this as we have as component of total cost and to the extent depreciation is up, we'll have to find other areas where we'll realize cost savings. I think a great example of that is just if you look within the capital itself. The capital for the building we purchased in the first quarter and the capital for the building that we intend to purchase in the second quarter will result in depreciation charges that are significantly less than the rent expense on those buildings. So there will be savings in the indirect pools right there that would be a component of how we would offset those increases in depreciation charges going forward. But we certainly see that as something we'll be able to manage as we have in the past, aggressively looking at holding our indirect rates. And then in terms of the range for cap ex, we certainly looked hard at that here as we were giving guidance for the first quarter. We believe it's appropriate to hold our range where it is, still a number of moving parts and a fair amount of time between now and the end of the year. But if we see some additional clarity on that between now and the other second quarter call, they'll certainly update that range as appropriate.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.
Hunter Keay: Hi, guys. Thanks. Good afternoon.
Ken Bedingfield: Hey, Hunter, how is it going?
Hunter Keay: Very good, thank you. A question on the IRAD. As we think about it, obviously it kicked up a little bit last year and I think I'll understand why that was the case and I was sort of thinking about that going forward as a percentage sales I mean, and if you want to answer the question on the context of sort of how DOD is maybe shifting all of the development expense over the industry. Are you seeing any particular areas where that emphasis of industry spending its own money is particularly emphasized like on radar programs or unmanned, or anything like that where you see a particular area of pressure to spend your own money to develop new systems? Thank you.
Wes Bush: Hunter, it's Wes. I think the thing to keep in mind with IRAD these are decisions that each company has to make on how it invest to position itself for the longer term. That really is the framework that we look at. When we think about IRAD, we drive the process internally to really test, “Are we making smart investments that really have the opportunity not just tomorrow?” Or sometimes you can just put in a couple of years, but over the long term, “Are these investments, they're really going to generate the opportunity to enhance our ability to support our customer and the result in profitable growth for the enterprise?” There's a lot of judgment that goes into making those investments. We looked across the full array of customer needs and in response to the second part of your question, I would say all of our customers are looking at a threat environment that is going to require that they bring more innovation to the game to the products that they're out acquiring, they're going to need more innovation to ensure that we're going to be able to put forth a military capability that truly is differentiated technologically. So it isn't just one area. Probably all of the areas you mentioned plus many more are representative of our customer's needs today to really enhance their capability to address their very difficult and challenging missions particularly as we look around the globe and see many other countries investing on the technology front as well in that regard. This is a core part of what we do, our fundamental business model. We invest, we bring brilliant scientists, and engineers, mathematicians together to figure out how to help our customers stay ahead. We don't want their effort to be a case where our service men and women have to go into a fair fight when it comes to the technology capabilities. We want to be with. These are our fundamental investment decisions that we make and given this growth in complexity that our customers are facing, I think it is incumbent on us collectively across our industry to be investing appropriately. You saw us take our IRAD investments up over the last couple of years, up into the 3% range and I anticipate going forward we'll be at that higher level of investment because we'd see the business imperative both through our customer's eyes and through the eyes of generating returns on those investments. So long as we can make smart investments, apply those funds in the right direction and bring together the right human capital, we should be in a really good position to support our customer's needs. That's the lens through which we see it. I know that there has been fair amount of public discourse about the need for both industry and quite frankly government to be spending more on investment, but I think it's just reflection of the reality of the thread environment. So we're stepping up, we certainly need government to step up in terms of this investment and fundamental R&D and product development. But I think this is something that's just a clear imperative and supports getting the right types of returns on those investments over time.
Operator: And your next question is from the line of Robert Spingarn form Credit Suisse.
Robert Spingarn: Good afternoon.
Wes Bush: Hey, Rob.
Ken Bedingfield: Hey, Rob.
Robert Spingarn: Hi, guys. Wes, I was going to ask you a program question and maybe it falls on a little bit from what you were just talking about, but you've always been viewed as a favorite for navy UCLASS strike platform which is now essentially been descoped down to a refueling system, CBARS. So I'm asking about how that changes Northrop's competitive discriminators? Does it alter where Northrop sees CBARS relative to other upcoming competitions, particularly given the major investments that you've made in the demonstrator prototypes?
Wes Bush: Rob, that's a good question and I think a really important one as we look at the underlying capabilities that will be required to support essentially any meaningful unmanned operation off the deck of an aircraft carrier. We're absolutely delighted with the ground work that's been laid by the X-47B program - taking off the deck of an aircraft carrier without a human in the loop is a neat trick onto itself, but landing on a deck of an aircraft carrier is a really neat trick and we're the only company that has done that, something of this capability. So we see ourselves as well-positioned to support whatever the mission requirement that the navy derives or unmanned operations on and off the deck of aircraft carriers, and we're going to continue to work hard to support the navy on this. Clearly, there are some differences that go with the variability of whatever the mission might be. Strike as I think about it from a long term perspective is going to continue to be really, really important. The navy is concerned as well about surveillance and reconnaissance with an edition's carrier asset and they've chosen to focus this next round of activity on refueling, which is also a really important mission for the navy. In all of those cases, they are mission-variants, but the underlying technology, the capability to design, and build, and reliably operate an autonomous - a truly autonomous system - in that type of environment, that's something that we've made a lot of progress on. X-47B was important for the navy in terms of demonstrating that this really could be done and I think CBARS and future variants of that type of unmanned capability are going to be really important opportunities for Northrop Grumman.
Ken Bedingfield: Hey, Robin, one more question.
Operator: And your final question comes from the line of Joe Zenardi [ph].
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks very much. Ken, I'm wondering if you could talk about just on the pension side? I think some of your peers are starting to see contributions ramp up over the next couple of years, so if you could just talk about what your required contributions look like going forward? I would imagine it's a little bit smoother than your peers. And then if you could just update us on FAS/CAS, maybe beyond 2016?
Ken Bedingfield: Yes. Thanks for the question, Joe. On pension, I would say that all things being equal in terms of where we are today versus where we were at the Q4 call in January where we provided some information on pension and without different assumptions, I don't see any changes from where we were then and at that point in time, I would say about call it on average, $100 million a year for '16, '17 and '18 in terms of required contributions primarily for our non-qualified plans and that was based on the discount rates at the end of the year and our expected rates of return. I would say that at this point in time, no major update from where we are there. We'll continue to evaluate that between now and at the end of the year and we'll tend to give some guidance around the third quarter call and an update to have our final assumptions at the end of the year. But we're looking at again, with assumptions that just stand today, not a significant level of pension funding requirements which is certainly a good place to be.
Steve Movius: With that, I'll turn the call over to Wes for final comments.
Wes Bush: Well, thanks, Steve. Let me just wrap up by thanking our team again for a good start to 2016. It's clear to us that our customers really need performance and innovation to successfully address their demanding missions and our team is absolutely focused on supporting them. So thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call today and thanks also for your continuing interest in our company.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's Fourth Quarter 2015 Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. My name is Brent and I will be your operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Steve Movius, Treasurer and Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Movius, please proceed.
Steve Movius: Thanks Brent, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's fourth quarter and year end 2015 conference call. We provided supplemental information in the form of a PowerPoint presentation, that you can access on our web site. First, a reminder that our 2015 financial results are reported in four sectors, our new three sector configuration is effective as of January 1, 2016. We will be filing an 8-K in April, which will present historical financial information in our new sector structure. Also, please understand that matters discussed on today's call constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which are detailed in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risk factors may cause actual company results to differ materially. Matters discussed on today's call might also include non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled in the supplemental PowerPoint presentation. On the call today are Wes Bush, our Chairman, CEO and President; and Ken Bedingfield, our CFO. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Wes.
Wes Bush: Thanks Steve. Hello everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Well I want to start by congratulating the entire Northrop Grumman team on another outstanding year. In addition to excellent financial results, we took some major steps to position the company for the future. We look forward to building on 2015 successes, as we continue our focus on performance, portfolio, and capital deployment, and as we take on new opportunities in 2016. Strong operational performance and effective cash deployment supported another year of value creation for shareholders, customers, and employees. Solid margin rates from all four of our businesses combined to generate a segment operating margin rate of 12.4% and earnings per share of $10.39, a 7% increase. Free cash flow before pension contributions was $2 billion, and we returned $3.8 billion to our shareholders. In total, we repurchased 19.3 million shares for $3.2 billion this year, reduced our weighted average share count by approximately 10%, and completed our goal of retiring 60 million shares by the end of 2015. At year end, $4.3 billion remained on our share repurchase authorization. Continued strong cash generation also supported our 12th consecutive annual dividend increase. We raise the quarterly dividend by 14% and paid shareholder $603 million in dividends in 2015. Total shareholder return for the year was slightly more than 30%. The first priority of our capital deployment strategy, is to invest in our businesses. 2015 capital spending totaled $471 million, and we increased our IRAD investment by 25% to $712 million, or 3% of sales, and we perceive significant opportunities ahead. In addition to strong financial results, we captured several important awards that position us well going forward. While LRSB was our most high profile competitive win in 2015, we had several other key strategic awards. Global Hawk solidified its position as the nation's next generation high altitude ISR platform, with a $3.2 billion IDIQ award for development, modernization, retrofit and sustainment activities. Congressional notification was completed for Japan's purchase of Global Hawks, and we received $437 million in FMS contracts for E2Ds for Japan. In the mid-altitude long endurance unmanned domain, we were selected for phase-3 of turn, which is a joint effort between DARPA and the Office of Naval Research, to demonstrate a next generation unmanned system for Maritime ISR and strike from small deck naval vessels. This important win, built on the unique naval unmanned capabilities, that we demonstrated through programs like UCAS, Fire Scout and Triton. And as many of you know, UCAS demonstrated fully autonomous unmanned aerial refueling last year, building on prior milestones of autonomous unmanned aircraft carrier take-offs and landings. Electronic Systems won important U.S. competitions like SEWIP Block 3and Kirkham. Both wins demonstrate our success and expanding into market adjacencies. SEWIP represents our entry into next generation sea-based electronic warfare, and Kirkham expands our infrared countermeasures presence into rotary winged aircraft protection. These wins are domestic programs, but they have long term potential for international sales. Also in Electronic Systems, Saber radars were selected for Taiwan to upgrade of its F-16 fleet, and we continue to work with Lockheed Martin on other international F-16 upgrade opportunities. Information Systems won the navy's JCREW award and will provide software programmable jammers to protect the warfighter from device triggered IEDs. These systems will provide important capabilities to both the Navy and the Air Force. IS was also competitively awarded a seven year IDIQ contract by the U.K. government to develop and deliver cyber security solutions, in support of data security and information assurance. And in Technical Services, Saudi Arabia awarded one of our joint ventures, which is consolidated IPS an approximately $950 million contract for the Ministry of National Guard Training Support. Year end total backlog was $35.9 billion. New awards in 2015 totaled $21.3 billion. Book to bill was strong in IS, TS and ES. Awards in AS are generally lumpy, and did not include LRS-B. And AS and ES awards did not include F-35 LRIPs 9 and 10, other than long lead items. We continue to capture international opportunities, and at year end, international awards represented 16% of our total backlog. As we look ahead, we have more stability on the budget front, and have better budget environment than we have had in several years. The bipartisan budget act passed in November raised the statutory limit on the desk ceiling until March 2017, and provided much needed relief on the BCA sequester caps in fiscal years 2016 and 2017. The Consolidated Appropriations act provided an increase in the procurement accounts and provides welcome funding stability for our customers. Our programs continue to be well supported, with a number of them receiving plus ups. While we have improved budgetary stability in FY 2016, the Department of Defense faces a shortfall in funding for fiscal 2017. We look forward to learning more about how this will be addressed, when the DoD introduces his FY 2017 budget in the coming weeks. Turning to guidance for 2016, we expect sales of $23.5 billion to $24 billion, with earnings per share of $9.90 to $10.20, and free cash flow of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion after capital expenditures of $700 million to $1 billion. Our 2016 guidance is indicative of another year of strong operating performance. This year, we are beginning work on some major new development programs, as we transition from a number of legacy production programs in aerospace and electronic systems to new production programs, in aerospace emission systems. And our restricted portfolio continues to grow, validating our technology leadership in several domains. I would note, that our guidance assumes that the stop-work order on LRS-B will be lifted in February, and that we will begin to ramp-up in performance on this program over the course of the year. So in summary, 2015 was an outstanding year for the company and for our shareholders. Going forward, our priorities remain the same, drive strong sustainable performance, generate strong cash, and effectively deploy that cash, and continue to optimize our portfolio, to ensure our alignment with global security priorities. We continue to build on our solid track record, and we look forward to continued long term sustainable value creation for our shareholders, customers and employees. So now, I will turn the call over to Ken, for a more detailed discussion of results and our guidance. Ken?
Ken Bedingfield: Thanks Wes and good afternoon everyone. I want to add my congratulations to our team for their continued outstanding work. Today, I will briefly review 2015 results, and then discuss our 2016 guidance. 2015 sales totaled $23.5 billion, slightly below our expectations, primarily due to reduction in lower margin material sales at Information Systems, some of which slipped into 2016. International sales increased to 14% of sales in 2015, an increase of approximately 10% over 2014, even with negative foreign exchange impacts. We expect stable international sales in 2016, as our NATO AGS program ramps down, and other international programs ramp-up. However, we expect international opportunities to be an important source of growth for the company over the next several years. Our businesses performed well and ended the year with a 12.4% segment operating margin rate. Operating performance this year is comparable to last year, considering that 2014 margin included $75 million legal settlement and about $45 million in non-recurring HAFTA benefit. The year-over-year trends reflect strong performance by all four sectors, with particularly strong performance by Information Systems, where margin rate increased 70 basis points over last year. Total operating margin rate for 2015 was 13.1% comparable to 2014. Higher net FAS/CAS adjustment was offset by an increase in unallocated corporate expenses. You will recall, that last quarter we mentioned fourth quarter unallocated corporate expenses would be higher than last year, due to the adoption of a tax method change and other state tax items. We have strong full year EPS of $10.39, which includes the benefit of a R&D credit. Turning to cash, 2015 was another good year, both in absolute dollar and on a per share basis. Free cash flow before discretionary pension contributions totaled $2 billion and we returned $3.8 billion or $19.75 per share to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. So it was an outstanding year, in terms of creating value for our shareholders. Looking ahead to 2016, we expect consolidated sales of $23.5 billion to $24 billion, with a segment operating margin in the high 11% range. Turning to sector guidance, we expect sales at Aerospace systems to increase to the low $10 billion range. This reflects a low single digit growth rate, and includes higher volume for space and unmanned programs. In manned military aircraft, we will continue to see higher volume for programs like E2D and F-35, which will be partially offset by lower volume for the FA-18. Our 2016 revenue guidance for Aerospace systems, also contemplates modest LRS-B sales, assuming the customer issues are noticed to proceed in February. It also assumes a gradual month-by-month step-up in headcount, as engineering on the program gets underway. We expect a mid-to-high 11% margin rate for aerospace in 2016. In addition to continued strong performance on our current portfolio of programs, our 2016 AS margin rate guidance, reflects the booking rate approach on LRS-B, that we believe is appropriate for the start of this incentive based development contract. We will review our booking rate over time, including for potential increases, as we work to retire risk and realize incentive fee milestones. For Mission Systems, we expect 2016 revenue in the high $10 billion range, which is a stable top line. Our MS sales guidance includes international growth, modest declines in some mature programs, and some impact from in-theater force reductions. We expect MS operating margin rate in the mid to high 12% range. For Technology Services, we expect sales in the mid $4 billion range, with an operating margin rate of approximately 10%. Our 2016 sales guidance represents a low single digit sales decline. Most of that decline is expected in our short cycle and services programs, including ICBM program ramp-down. We expect the decline will be partially offset by international growth. Consolidated segment operating margin rate is expected to be in the high 11% range, reflecting a portfolio of changing business mix with less mature fixed price production revenue. We expect our total operating margin rate will be approximately 12% after net FAS/CAS pension adjustment of $275 million and unallocated corporate expense of approximately $200 million. Based on 2015 return on planned assets of negative 1%, a discount rate of 4.53%, and expected 2016 return on planned assets of 8%, 2016 FAS is estimated at $585 million and CAS at $860 million. For 2017 and 2018, we currently expect CAS expense of approximately $1 billion and $1.1 billion for 2018. For FAS expense, we currently expect $470 million and $400 million for 2017 and 2018, respectively. And for your modeling purposes, holding all other assumptions constant, a 25 basis point change in the discount rate results in a change of approximately $70 million in FAS expense, and a 100 basis point change in planned asset returns versus our expected rate of return results in a $50 million change in FAS expense, while CAS is less sensitive to both. In aggregate on a GAAP basis, the funded status of our plans was 82% at the end of 2015, reflecting the impact of our higher discount rate, discretionary contributions in 2015, and actual plan asset returns. Our qualified plans are 86% funded. Our required contributions remain minimal, about $80 million in 2016 and 2017, increasing to about $125 million in 2018, given our current assumptions. We expect a tax rate of approximately 30% in 2016, which include the now permanent R&D credit. Our 2016 earnings per share guidance of $9.90 to $10.20 assumes our weighted average shares are reduced by approximately 6% to about 181 million shares. We expect 2016 free cash flow before discretionary pension contributions to range between $1.5 billion and $1.8 billion. Our free cash flow guidance anticipates capital spending of $700 million to $1 billion in 2016. Capital expenditures in 2015 were lower than originally expected, as we actively managed our capital spending to support requirements that slipped into 2016. In addition to some of our 2015 spending moving into 2016, CapEx will be elevated this year due to increased programmatic requirements, as well as the planned purchase of several buildings. We have leased some of these buildings for many years and now have the opportunity to purchase them. We expect these purchases to total about $300 million and to support our continued focus on cost reduction, affordability and competitiveness. Our guidance reflects another year of strong operating performance and strong cash generation, supportive of the continued investment in our businesses and distribution of cash to our shareholders. Before we start the Q&A, I just want to note that due to the classified nature of the LRS-B program, we won't be providing any information beyond what we've said in our prepared remarks. So we will not be taking any questions on that program. I think we're ready for Q&A. Steve?
Steve Movius: Thanks, Ken. Before we begin the Q&A, please note, as usual, no more than a single question per participant. Feel free to reenter the queue if you have additional questions. Brent, we're ready to start the Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays.
Carter Copeland: Good morning, gentlemen.
Ken Bedingfield: Hello, Carter. How are you?
Carter Copeland: Fantastic. Ken, could you help us maybe bridge what moved in and out of Aerospace? I know you added Asuza and took Electronic Attack out. But to go from 11 to low 10s, how should we think about the relative size of the pieces that move there? And then just to add on to that, the net margin impact of one versus the other, if there's anything of significance there to note.
Ken Bedingfield: So Carter, just to make sure we're on the same page with in and out, you're correct, Azusa and Bethpage out. Think of them as relatively even sized businesses. In terms of Aerospace, 2015 was just over $10 billion, $10.004 billion in sales. As we mentioned, we're projecting low 10s for sales in 2016, so low single digit growth at Aerospace. In terms of margin, I wouldn't think of those two businesses as significantly different in terms of margin rates.
Carter Copeland: Okay. Great. Thanks. And just a quick one on the CapEx on the office buildings, $300 million seems like a big amount. Is this Space Park or something that's high end real estate that we should be thinking that is there, or is it just the scale of a lot of buildings?
Ken Bedingfield: It's not Space Park, which is already, for the most part, owned. But it is a number of buildings. And it certainly is a large capital outlay, but we do believe over the long term, the benefits are such that we'll realize affordability, we'll have obviously avoided rent expense and those cash outflows down the road. So we think it's a good decision, buildings that are core to our new three sectors and particularly Mission Systems.
Carter Copeland: Okay. Great. I'll let someone else ask.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies.
Howard Rubel: Thank you very much. Wes, you talked about a number of new wins during the course of the year, whether it's SEWIP or Kirkham or so on. If we were to look at old versus new, what do you figure the percentage of new business is for 2016 versus 2015?
Wes Bush: So like most years, the challenge with new business, with the way the appropriations process works and the conversion into sales, it takes a little bit of time for the new wins to transition from the win, and then, of course, the appropriation, into the actual outlay and the contracting and then converting it into sales. So of all of those things that I just mentioned as we went through, none of them, or in aggregate, I would say, they do not represent a large fraction of our sales in 2016. Most of these things will manifest in the sales that we'll see in 2017 and beyond. So I wouldn't venture a guess, because it would only be that, in terms of the actual percentage. But I think to get to the general vector of your question, it takes a little bit of time to pull those things through, but we're pulling hard.
Howard Rubel: All right. Thanks very much.
Wes Bush: Thanks, Howard.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton.
Pete Skibitski: Good morning, guys. Wes, I saw during the quarter some press about this new Northrop advanced design organization. And it sounds like a lot of pretty rapid aircraft prototyping efforts, stuff like that, like the old days. And I was wondering what's driving that. Is it connected to the third offense strategy or just what the strategy is there?
Wes Bush: Yes, I appreciate the question. When we think about the pace of technology and also, quite frankly, the pace of the threats that our nation faces, we've all been frustrated over the last, it's more than a decade now, at the general slowing that we seem to see and the ability to take good ideas and turn them into reality. So part of our overall technology and development focus in the Company is focused around speed. Because speed does matter. Speed matters to support the war fighter. Obviously, it matters as we're addressing a lot of these emerging threats that we're seeing around the globe. And we don't have to wait for a procurement program to come out for us to jump into things and to demonstrate that we can move it along a bit more quickly. We can do it, oftentimes, ourselves through our internal investments. And as I noted in my prepared remarks, we've been increasing those internal investments. You pointed out the particular category of what we've been doing on the aircraft side and we are especially proud of that. We have the ability within the Company to quite rapidly go from conceptual thinking to prototyping and to flying those prototypes so that we can get good early engineering information and turn that around back into the design approach that we're utilizing to bring actual products to offer to our customer community. And our scale composites organization is a really important part of that process that we utilize in our Company, a really innovative and capable group at scale and have a long track record of demonstrating the speed to product, if you will, in terms of our ability to prototype. But that's one example of a broader perspective that we have in the Company that the work that we're doing to support our customers needs for the long term needs to not only be at the high end of technology, they need to be able to access it quickly and utilize it in a very effective manner.
Pete Skibitski: Wes, has DoD given you an indication that they would provide production on ramps for you as part of such an endeavor?
Wes Bush: So we try and align what we're doing with the vector that we see Do D on. We don't expect that we just walk in the door and we suddenly get a production turn on. We see these as very important parts of our ability to be competitive. And so we're not actually asking DoD for any assurances in turn ons. We're simply seeing this as the challenge that we collectively have across our industry to make sure that the most advanced technologies are ready quickly for our customers.
Pete Skibitski: Very good. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi.
Jason Gursky: Good afternoon.
Wes Bush: Hello, Jason.
Jason Gursky: I wanted to go back to Howard's question really quickly and see if I couldn't get you to talk a little bit more about the wins in 2015. Which ones do you think represent the biggest long-term strategic opportunity for the Company? And then maybe just comment on when you might expect some of this development work that you've been successful with over the list couple of years to lead to an inflection point in the growth rate overall for the Company?
Wes Bush: I appreciate the question. Last year was phenomenal in terms of our positioning with some of these wins. And as I noted earlier, clearly LRS-B, which is currently under protest, so we're having to wait for that process to work its way through. But just in terms of the win itself, was a very nice win, one that we'd worked hard on for a number of years and we were delighted to see that outcome and to be ready to go and execute that when the time comes. That will represent a meaningful opportunity, a very meaningful opportunity for the Company over time. But I would not want to overlook many of the other things that happened last year that are so critically important for our long-term positioning in the enterprise. While Triton was not a win, if you will, last year, last year was such a notable year in terms of its programmatic progress that I think it's important to lay that out. It's a program that we've been in development on for a number of years. And the progress that we made last year with the articles that we have flying and the testing that was being done really puts that program in a good place as we move forward this year to be ready to enter into LRIP. I think that's a really important milestone as we think about these next steps in unmanned capability, Triton representing the natural evolution from Global Hawk. And we see that as an important capability not only for our Navy customer, our direct Navy customer on this, but I think it represents the high altitude long endurance solution that's going to be sought after by many customers, including many of our allies around the globe. So that is sort of in the unmanned domain as, I think, a representative program of the big steps. The work that was done last year at Electronic Systems to break into some new adjacencies, I also would point out as really important work, notably, the wins on SEWIP and Kirkham. The SEWIP win was one that for us was a long reach into a domain that we think is going to be incredibly important for the future, which is all of the work that's being done by the Navy for advanced electronic warfare. And while over the years in the past we've held a few smaller positions in that regard, SEWIP really does position us in that space in a new way. And we're excited about what that represents and the opportunities that will come with it. And in Kirkham, this was a move into the rotary wing adjacency for aircraft protection. We've had a long and successful run and have a great future in the fixed wing side of things, but to move into the rotary wing side of it, as well, was another big step forward for us. So I'll stop there. I could keep going. But I would just point those out as some of the clearly significant milestones that we encountered last year that as we go through the course of this year, but I would say it's really more into next year as we really begin to ramp up on these things, that we'll see an impact on our trajectory.
Jason Gursky: So the second part of the question was just the inflection point on the growth rate, and maybe your last statement there was the answer, but 2017 is the year that we begin to see the acceleration in the growth rate?
Wes Bush: Well, we don't guide for 2017. We're guiding for 2016, so I don't want to get too far out in front of that. But I would go back to a point I made when Howard asked a similar question, which is if you look back over the history of the way that changes in defense spending translate into changes in the industry, I'll say it broadly, the industry's revenue cycle, there's generally a delay. If you look back at the downturn cycle, our most recent experience in that, I think the investment accounts peaked right around 2010 and you saw the related sales and industry peak a couple years later, and I think it's just that is just a reflection of a natural cycle. And if you look back in history at the up cycles, you'll see a similar situation, where it simply takes a little bit of time for the decisions that the Department makes on the new things that it needs to translate all the way from the appropriations cycle through to the outcome cycle. So I think this is just going to be another one of those situations. Everyone likes to talk about where are we in the trough. And I think it's important to remember that the trough has a part in the rear view mirror which was a steep down cycle, hopefully in the rear view mirror, and then it takes a little bit of time for that transition to come into effect as we climb out of that.
Jason Gursky: Perfect. Thanks.
Wes Bush: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.
Myles Walton: Thanks. Good afternoon, guys.
Wes Bush: Good afternoon, Myles.
Myles Walton: The first one -- or the only one, Steve, that I have, in multiple parts -- is on the side with Aerospace and the growth, I think you implied a low single digit. And I think the only headwind I heard was the F-18 and the size of that I was thinking was a couple hundred million, and everything else it sounded like you rattled off, Ken, was growing, inclusive of the drop in of LRS-B. So I guess I'm just curious A, is the F-18 headwind bigger, or B, is everything else just in a growth mode, but it's a really, really low growth mode?
Ken Bedingfield: Thanks for the question, Myles. I would say F-18 is probably the largest of the declining piece of the business and certainly worth pointing out, as we've been successful on that program and have realized some nice margins out of that. But I think the other thing I would point out is we are seeing lower volume in 2016 in the unrestricted space business, particularly AHF and the James Webb Space Telescope, as those are moving into a more mature phase of their life cycle. The other piece of the decline that we pointed out was a bit in NATO AGS, as we've reached, again, a level of maturity on that program, as well. So a number of moving parts that go together to give us the low single digit 2016 sales increase.
Myles Walton: Got it. And then just one clarification, on the $300 million of CapEx for the buildings, we should think of this as a one-off and the underlying normalized level of CapEx is $300 million less of what you're telling us?
Ken Bedingfield: Good question, Myles. I think what I would say is, as we've discussed, we do expect CapEx to remain elevated for a couple more years. And that represents our investing in the business for a robust set of opportunities that we see ahead of us. And I wouldn't want to give CapEx guidance beyond 2016, but in terms of the level of elevation, certainly I wouldn't consider the $300 million in where you look at it. I do think those are more of a one-off in 2016. But certainly, we look really hard at every investment we make and we do believe firmly these are worthwhile investments.
Myles Walton: Okay. Thanks.
Wes Bush: And while we're transitioning to our next question, Steve is reminding me that I slipped a couple years in the timeline that I was giving Jason. It is about a two-year delay in the difference between the peaks of DoD budgeting and contractor revenues. I think I said it was 2010 to 2012. It was actually DoD peak in 2008 and contractor revenue is peaking in 2010. But the point is still the same. It's a couple year difference that we've historically seen.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS.
David Strauss: Good afternoon. Ken, just wanted to touch on the balance sheet and cash flow. I see you put some additional cash on the balance sheet this past quarter. Can you talk about what you see as the right level of cash on the balance sheet and then also touch on what you've assumed in your operating cash or free cash flow guidance for working capital and cash taxes relative to 2015? Thanks.
Ken Bedingfield: Appreciate the question. I would say that we, in terms of managing cash on the balance sheet, we certainly prudently manage that to make sure that we have got sufficient cash and liquidity. We're north of $2 billion at the end of the year. We were north of $1 billion at the end of the third quarter. So I wouldn't necessarily want to put a target out there on where we are, but we certainly actively manage that. And in terms of cash guidance, I would say from a working capital perspective, I think we're looking at it as relatively stable, a lot of moving parts in working capital this year, particularly some changes in accruals and mostly timing type items. But cash taxes, I would say that we saw a really good year for cash taxes in 2015. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like we'll be able to repeat that in 2016. So I would say a relatively higher level of cash taxes in 2016, but I would say net working capital could be a bit better than it was in 2015.
David Strauss: Any way you could quantify the cash tax headwind, rough level?
Ken Bedingfield: I don't think I'd want to quantify that. I would say that the team, our tax team, actually working really closely with our sector teams, combined to have a great result in 2015. And I wouldn't want to put a number out there, because I suspect that our teams will continue to work hard and do better than what I currently think they could do. So appreciate the question.
David Strauss: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein.
Doug Harned: Thank you.
Wes Bush: Hello, Doug.
Doug Harned: Hello. I wanted to talk a little bit about Information Systems in the last quarter and actually in 2015. The margins were good. And I know in the release, there was nothing that appeared there that indicated anything one-time, just all around good performance. So you have a good margin there and then you split Information Systems in two and lose some to Technical Services, the service portion, products over to Mission Systems. But when you look at the Technical Services side going forward, you're projecting 10% margins there. Can you talk about how I would expect the lower margin part of Information Systems would be moving into Tech Services, how do you get to that 10% and have you seen an upshift in the ability to perform on your Information Systems business overall?
Ken Bedingfield: So Doug, I would say that, and let me address first the 2015 piece and a number of parts there that drove the strong margin. First of all, a great performance by the team. We also saw some, as I mentioned, of the lower level of the material sales that have a lower than average margin in that business. So that certainly helped contribute. In terms of looking forward for the new Technology Services sector and its strong margin rate at 10%, it did pick up a number of services business from IS that have actually above margin rates as you look at the legacy IS business, particularly the civil and health businesses that were in IS. So as we look forward, we see technology Services as having a strong 10% margin rate.
Wes Bush: This is Wes. I would add that we've worked hard over the last number of years to remove from our portfolio the lower margin parts of our service business. We've not seen that as really the best fit for the Company for the long term. So I think what you're seeing, in addition to sort of the layout of the components that Ken addressed, I do think you're seeing just a broader move forward in how we position the portfolio and the services part of our business. And it's reflected in the way that we're giving you a forecast for 2016.
Doug Harned: Okay. So that looks like, going forward, that looks like really a 10% type business now, which is great for a service business.
Wes Bush: Well, we are in the process of benchmarking. As you know, we go through a process early each year to sort through what we think the right benchmarks are for our businesses. And of course, we incentivize our team to do better than those benchmarks. So we're not in a place where we're going to give you a forward look on what it should be. But in terms of our guidance for 2016, you can see the number and I think it's reflective of the great work the team's been doing.
Doug Harned: Very good. Thank you.
Wes Bush: Thanks, Doug.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with RBC Capital.
Robert Stallard: Thanks so much. Good afternoon.
Wes Bush: Hello, Rob.
Robert Stallard: Your colleagues over at Lockheed Martin put some details around their F-35 plan the other day and it's a pretty steep ramp up in 2018. As a major supplier, I was wondering if you're fully capitalized for that move up and whether that move up under your fixed price contract structure will also be helpful to margins? Thank you.
Wes Bush: Well, we're all looking forward to F-35s making progress on the ramp. This was a ramp that we've all been preparing for many years, both in terms of our facilities, as well as making sure that we've got the supply chain capacity and the people capacity to effectively execute the ramp. We're ready and we've been ready. This was a program that, as I said, we've been preparing for quite some time. And I won't speak on behalf of Lockheed, but from a broader team perspective, this has been the topic of a lot of engagement and the assurance that we need to provide collectively to our customer community that we're all going to be able to get this job done. The nature of the contracting at the prime level I won't address. That's a very appropriate interaction with Lockheed. But moving us into a more normal process, both in the contracting side and on the ramp side of where we really should be on a program like this, we're all looking forward to that.
Ken Bedingfield: And Rob, if I could just add that if you think about F-35 for us, we do have four contracts for F-35, the center fuselage, the radar, the DAS and the C&I. And I will just point out that we are on units of delivery for each of those four contracts. So the timing of the ramp, as you see out of our business, could be a little bit different out of what you'll see out of Lockheed. So just want to make sure you keep that in mind as you look forward.
Robert Stallard: But presuming you'd be a little bit ahead of them, maybe six to nine months or something like that?
Ken Bedingfield: We would be ahead of them in the production cycle, but from a revenue recognition standpoint, not necessarily.
Robert Stallard: Right. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.
Cai von Rumohr: Yes. Thank you very much. So Ken, would it be possible to get the three new segment numbers for 2015 so that we can better gauge your guidance and what's getting us from one year to the other?
Ken Bedingfield: Thanks for the question, Cai. We are planning to file an 8-K that will present our realigned structure from the current four sectors at the end of 2015 to the new three sectors as we move forward in 2016. And that 8-K we expect to be filed in April before we file our first quarter 10-Q that will include three years of information on the three-sector format. And that's the earliest we'll be providing that information.
Cai von Rumohr: Can we just get a rough sense? You've told us we're looking at low single digit growth in Aerospace Systems. Because just having this guidance in the absence of knowing the baseline is a little bit difficult to make any kind of guess, even on a full-year basis.
Ken Bedingfield: I would say, Cai, that as we look at it, we provided the guidance on the prepared remarks in terms of the expected sales range and the whether it was growth or flat or slightly declining in terms of Technology Services. And at this point, I think that's the best we can do for you.
Cai von Rumohr: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.
Sam Pearlstein: Good afternoon.
Wes Bush: Hello, Sam.
Sam Pearlstein: Can you talk a little bit about, if I look at your 2015, the cash from operations before the discretionary payment, looks like it's a little over $100 million less than what you projected, and that was coupled with a CapEx that came in lower. So what moved out of 2015?
Ken Bedingfield: You know, Sam, I would say that if I look at cash from operations, we were a little bit shy of last year. We had some just some timing of things, timing of cash collections on some fixed price contracts where we have performance based payment terms and some protected negotiations that have driven some delays there, a little bit on some payroll accrual items/ But overall, I think that it was a strong cash year, cash from ops before the pension prefunding of about $2.5 billion and free cash flow, again before the prefunding, of just north of $2 billion, so a lot of cash generation in the fourth quarter. Our profile has tended to be that way, but this year was a bit more even, for us heavily weighted into the fourth quarter. And we'll work hard to try to bring some of that forward as we look at 2016.
Sam Pearlstein: And if I can follow-up Ken, I think you had said the guidance assumes the share count is down 6%. Is that the share count or are we talking about the average shares? Because that obviously implies very different level of buyback.
Ken Bedingfield: Yes, it's the 6% reduction in the weighted average number of diluted shares.
Sam Pearlstein: Thank you.
Ken Bedingfield: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.
Seth Seifman: Thanks very much and good morning. You mentioned in the Technology Service business the ramp down on work on ICBM. Wondering if you look out over a multi-year period, do you see modernization of nuclear forces as a key revenue driver?
Wes Bush: This is Wes. I think there's going to be a lot of opportunity in that modernization wave. It's another one of these areas that, unfortunately, as a nation, we put off, I think, for probably too, long and so now we're going to have to deal with a significant amount of modernization. It is an area of deep expertise within our enterprise. Most of that expertise is within our Technology Services organization in terms of the historical programs like ICBM. But it's actually resident, we have significant capability in all three of our sectors. So as we look forward at this wave of modernization, it's an area that we do intend to participate in, I think we can bring a lot to the customer community in that regard, and we look forward to addressing those opportunities.
Seth Seifman: Thanks very much.
Wes Bush: Thanks, Seth.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.
George Shapiro: Yes, just wanted to go through earnings. At the beginning of last year, you said you'd earn $9.20 to $9.50. You made $10.39. So can you go through where the opportunities were last year and if this year would offer similar opportunities to the guidance that you just provided?
Ken Bedingfield: So George, the single largest driver to the guidance last year to the performance this year, the single largest driver would be the R&D credit, which was not in the guide last year, as it was not enacted, versus this year with the permanence of the R&D credit today, we see it as in our guidance. And other than that, it's really about performance. If there was a single program that was a material piece of our performance in 2015, we would have disclosed what that was. So it really was just strong performance by the team across the board, all four of the sectors in 2015 contributing to that performance. As we look forward at 2016, we think about the risks and the challenges that are ahead of us. We think about the opportunities and how we can manage those risks and how we can take the most advantage of those opportunities to drive continuing performance as we look forward. So I think that's really the name of the game.
Wes Bush: The R&D credit is, what, maybe $0.20, $0.25, I don't know whether you specifically disclose it in the release or not. So you still had $0.75 of other items and you're saying those are all in aggregate $0.75, but isolated much less than the $0.25 one-time item?
Ken Bedingfield: Yes, I think that's fair. I would say the R&D credit is more like $0.30 and then the other items are, again, just an amalgamation of strong performance across the Company.
George Shapiro: Okay. And if I might follow-up with a totally different question. You mentioned in the release that the unmanned business had less favorable performance. Could you specify maybe how much that actually was and what programs that it refers to?
Ken Bedingfield: I wouldn't want to refer to the programs or the specific amounts. I will just say again, if it was material on any particular program, we would have disclosed it, but we look forward to realizing opportunities in unmanned as we move forward.
George Shapiro: Okay. Thanks very much.
Wes Bush: Thanks, George.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.
Hunter Keay: Hello. Thank you guys, appreciate it. Can you guys quantify the margin benefit you're going to get, the SG&A, from the $300 million CapEx spend both this year and then on an ongoing annual basis?
Ken Bedingfield: Hunter, appreciate the question, but I wouldn't want to quantify what that is. I will just say that we take really a disciplined approach to making these investments and we only make these investments when we see a reasonable return. But we do believe that this is significant to our businesses and will provide a long-term benefit in terms of affordability and competitiveness.
Wes Bush: And I would just put a fine point on what Ken just said. It's often the thought to model it into rate structures and that perspective, from how does it drop down to the bottom line quickly. But many of the things that we do of that nature in our Company go precisely, as Ken said, to affordability, to our ability to compete effectively, capture new business, and to address our customers' continuing needs for more capability at lower cost. So when we have the opportunity to do this type of a transaction, if you will, that is clearly cost effective, it just makes a lot of sense for us to take that on. So we look at it, obviously, we demand a return on any type of capital deployment that we do, but it has multiple benefits that I think are important to recognize.
Hunter Keay: Okay. Thank you, Wes and Ken. And just a quick one. I'm sorry for the basic question here, but can you explain to me why F-18 is a headwind this year, given the recent adds we saw in the FY16 budget? Thanks for the time.
Wes Bush: It had been at a much higher rate of production. And so what we're seeing is just the slow, gentle ramp down on the program. We're delight to see some of these additional opportunities on F-18, because it continues to be just a great aircraft and is, I think, performing well for all of its users around the globe. So it's nice to see that, but it's just a cycle down.
Hunter Keay: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse.
Robert Spingarn: Good afternoon.
Wes Bush: Hello, Rob.
Robert Spingarn: Hello, guys. I wanted to follow-up on Sam's question, Ken, on the cash. And so I guess if you back out the prefunding in 2015, you're at about, I think you said 2.5 on the OCF. And it looks like it's about the same in 2016 when you adjust, based on the guidance you gave us on free cash flow and CapEx. But with the flattish sales, FAS/CAS a little lower, margins lower, and cash taxes higher, is there anything else that we should be thinking about there that offsets to the positive?
Ken Bedingfield: No, I think you're thinking about it right, Rob. I would say that if you think about FAS/CAS, the impact is more higher FAS than it is on the CAS side, so I'd factor that into it. The only other item I would mention is timing of international awards. We had gotten some international advances and been burning those down in 2015. I think I mentioned some of the accrual items, and then again really comes back to continuing to focus on working capital and improve our working capital position from here.
Robert Spingarn: Okay. And then just, you mentioned international, just brings up one more thing. Wes, in the Mid East, are you seeing pressure there, anything new lately?
Wes Bush: Well, clearly the governments are collectively economically having to deal with the situation in oil. But at the same time, they're having to deal with the threat environment that's all around them. So we continue to see robust demand. We continue to see a very high degree of engagement with our allies in the region. And I suspect that's the way it's going to be for awhile, because of just the reality of the security situation throughout the region. So from our more narrow optic than the broader economic optic, we've not really seen any backing off from the needs for support on the security front and, if anything, in some areas, it's growing.
Robert Spingarn: Okay. Thank you.
Steve Movius: Brent, I think we'll do one more question.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Ron Epstein: Hello. Good morning.
Wes Bush: Hello, Ron.
Ron Epstein: I have maybe a big picture question for you, Wes. Because I think this has worked out well for you guys, but I just want to get your opinion on it. Today, do you think that the DoD is rewarding companies for making their own investments in R&D? I mean, you mentioned on the call you're spending 3% of sales on R&D. Do you think there's a bias today towards contractors that are willing to put more skin in the game than in previous years?
Wes Bush: So the way I would frame that is if you're investing smart in R&D, you're going to be more competitive on what the Department wants to acquire, so the reward comes when you win. And that's really the way we think about this equation, that by investing smartly for R&D, we're going to have the products and capabilities in place that our customers need over time. This is, in many respects, this is the story of our industry over a decade of cycles, that we have to be engaging with our customer community in a way that we can have insight into what their future needs are going to be. Because you can't just wake up one morning and say, I need a different class of performance than I had yesterday. It takes time to get those capabilities in place and we do rely on the DoD having follow through from the stated needs to actually acquiring things, because that's how we get a return on those investments. We go and we compete and when successful, we win and we perform on those programs. So I don't think there's any significant difference that I would cite in terms of the way that the overall model is working. I think there has been a lot more attention of late, from a DoD perspective, into where are all of the sources of the R&D investment that they can tap into. Because quite frankly, the amount of R&D appropriations that the Department has had available to it to go and make its own investments has declined over the last number of years, and in many respects is declining at exactly the wrong time, while our potential adversaries around the globe are investing much more aggressively in R&D. So DoD very appropriately looks to the broader ecosystem that supports it and is in need of those investments being made for the long term, and I do think that it pays off if you do it smart. If you're applying that investment in areas that turn out to be the right ones for our customers and if can convert those investments and capabilities into competitive offerings that really meet the customers needs. So I think the model makes sense, but it requires that very high degree of engagement with our customer community to make sure we keep that alignment.
Ron Epstein: Great. Thank you.
Wes Bush: Thank you.
Steve Movius: At this point in time, I'd like to turn the call over to you, Wes, for final comments.
Wes Bush: Thank, Steve. Well, as I said at the beginning of the call, 2015 was an outstanding year for our Company and I'm really proud of what our team accomplished last year. And I have to say, I'm looking forward to what this team can accomplish in 2016. So thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call today and really appreciate your continuing interest in our Company.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's Third Quarter 2015 Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. My name is Kaitlin and I will be your operator today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Steve Movius, Treasurer and Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Movius, please proceed.
Stephen C. Movius - Treasurer & Vice President-Investor Relations: Thanks, Kaitlin, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's third quarter 2015 conference call. Before we start, please understand the matters discussed on today's call constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainties, which are detailed in today's earnings release and our SEC filings.

On the call today are Wes Bush, our Chairman, CEO and President; and Ken Bedingfield, our CFO. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Wes.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I want to start our call today by expressing how proud we are that the Air Force has chosen to partner with Northrop Grumman on our nation's new Stealth Bomber. Our selection continues a 35-year partnership that has provided the world's most advanced long range strike systems. As the company that developed and delivered the B-2 Spirit Stealth Bomber, we look forward to providing the Air Force a highly capable and affordable next generation bomber. Our nation urgently needs this capability to maintain military superiority and power projection for decades to come. The Air Force has made the right decision. Our team has the resources in place to successfully execute this important program and we are ready to get to work. I want to thank our team across the company that have worked so hard on this program for so many years. This team is fully committed to building the next bomber for our nation and they are truly an exceptional group of individuals. I know that many of you have questions about the program. Given the classified nature of the program, we will not be answering questions about it on our call today. The Air Force released a set of information regarding the program yesterday when it announced its decision. We will not be in a position today to provide any more information than has been released by the Air Force. So in our Q&A session, we will decline to address the program in any more detail. This win also validates that we are successfully positioning Northrop Grumman for innovation and affordability in support of our customers' missions. Part of that positioning for the future is the organizational realignment we announced earlier this month. We announced a realignment of our businesses into three sectors effective January 1, 2016. Our new structure is aimed at better focusing our innovation and affordability efforts to provide our customers enhanced mission capability at a reduced cost. By more effectively aligning and aggregating our product and services businesses, we are enabling greater synergy in the way we operate and we are enhancing our ability to develop, produce, sustain and upgrade our products over their lifecycle. The majority of our Information Systems portfolio focuses on sophisticated systems architecture and engineering including both advanced software and hardware capabilities. These elements will be combined with our Electronic Systems portfolio to create a more integrated platform to support development of new capabilities for our military and intelligence customers around the globe. Kathy Warden, currently President of Information Systems, will lead the new Mission Systems sector. The services elements of Information Systems will be combined with Technical Services to create a new sector, Technology Services. Over the years, we have deemphasized commodity-based services and we focused our existing TS sector on lifecycle support and modernization of systems and platforms as well as advanced training. The IS services portfolio will complement this work, as it also focuses on advanced support and services. Technology Services will better integrate the breadth of our capabilities to enable us to provide differentiated and value-added offerings to the U.S. and to our allies. Chris Jones, currently President of Technical Services, will lead our Technology Services sector. Tom Vice will continue to lead Aerospace Systems. Tom and the AF team have a tremendous set of current programs and new opportunities. Gloria Flach will become Northrop Grumman's Chief Operating Officer with responsibility for operational excellence and risk management and our corporate-wide activities for programs, engineering, global supply chain and quality. Gloria, Kathy, Tom and Chris will all continue to report to me. I'd like to address some of the speculation that this realignment is perhaps aimed at separating our services businesses. It is not. We've demonstrated that we actively manage our portfolio and we continually evaluate our portfolio to assess value creation opportunities. We have over the last several years reshaped the content of our service offerings to reposition us at the higher end of the market. Our margin rates show that those efforts have been successful. The reorganization of our services business is intended to strengthen this capability within our company. So we're happy with our portfolio today and look forward to the work that Chris and his expanded team will do to further improve our position. Looking at third quarter results, our team delivered another solid performance. Third quarter EPS increased 22%, reflecting strong operating income and the benefit of share repurchases. Share repurchases continue to be an integral part of our capital deployment strategy. In May of 2013, we announced a goal of retiring 25% of our then outstanding shares by the end of 2015. I'm pleased to report that we have achieved that goal shortly after the end of the quarter. We completed the planned repurchases at an average price of approximately $125 per share. Since initiating share repurchases in 2003, we have reduced our share count by about 50% at an average price of approximately $75. Our capital deployment strategy, with share repurchases being a significant component, has successfully created shareholder value. During the quarter, our board approved a new $4 billion share repurchase authorization. At the end of the third quarter, $4.6 billion remained on our share repurchase authority. With this new authorization, share repurchase will continue to be an important element our strategy, but we do not intend to announce a new target for share count reduction. In 2013, we took the approach of announcing a specific target because we were going to the debt markets to support achievement of that target. Going forward, we will return to our prior approach of assessing our repurchases from time-to-time in the context of our capital deployment strategy, which has not changed. That strategy is to invest in our businesses, manage our balance sheet and return cash to shareholders through a competitive dividend and share repurchases. Our first priority, of course, continues to be investing in our business. We have increased our IRAD and capital spending to support our customers' needs for innovation and affordability. We also have greater visibility into a more favorable opportunity set ahead of us. We believe our portfolio is well aligned for long-term profitable growth. The global environment of continually expanding and evolving security threats drives an urgent need on the part of our customers for innovative and affordable technologies. We are investing to support their missions and we are encouraged by the news that the administration and congressional leadership have reached the two-year budget deal that provides some stability for federal budgeting and helps to minimize the threat of a government shutdown or a debt-ceiling showdown. This type of action is needed to provide stability and to support our customers' ability to plan for and properly execute our nation's security strategy. We hope that Congress quickly implements this agreement as we are rapidly approaching a debt-ceiling deadline and the CR we are working under expires on December 11. In summary, it was a solid quarter. Based on year-to-date results, we now expect 2015 sales between $23.6 billion and $23.8 billion. We are increasing earnings per share guidance to between $9.70 and $9.80. And we are refining our cash from operations guidance to approximately $2.6 billion and we expect free cash flow of approximately $2 billion. So now, I'll turn the call over to Ken for a more detailed discussion of our third quarter results and our guidance. Ken?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President: Thanks, Wes. I want to thank the team for a job well done and also congratulate our team on the LRS-B win. It was another good quarter. Overall, we continue to perform well with sales comparable to last year's third quarter and strong margin rates. Earnings per share grew 22%, driven by strong performance and a 10% decline in weighted average share count. I would note that our third quarter results do not reflect the impact of the tax methods change we discussed on last quarter's call and previously expected to occur in the third quarter. The IRS notified us of their acceptance of the change this month and those impacts will occur in the fourth quarter. Turning to sector results. We had strong performance across the board. Aerospace Systems sales for the quarter and year-to-date are up about 1% and reflect higher F-35 and E-2D production volume as well as higher volume for our unmanned programs. These increases were partially offset by declines in a number of other programs, the largest of which was the F/A-18, as deliveries on this program continue to ramp down. Aerospace third quarter and year-to-date operating income and margin rates are lower than last year due to one-time items in last year's third quarter which added about $90 million of operating income. You recall that last year's AS operating income included $75 million for settlements and also benefited from lower CAS pension cost due to the HATFA legislation. Based on year-to-date results, we expect full year Aerospace sales of approximately $10 billion, the high end of our prior guidance, and we continue to expect a margin rate of about 12%. Moving to Electronic Systems, third quarter sales increased 2% and on a year-to-date basis are comparable to last year. Third quarter operating income was consistent with last year. The slight decline in operating margin rate is due to the HATFA driven reduction of last year's pension cost, which increased margin rates in last year's third quarter. Although year-to-date operating income is somewhat lower than last year due to the mix of mature production and cost-type development work, operating margin rate continues to be strong. We expect full year ES sales of approximately $6.9 billion, the high end of our prior range, and we continue to expect ES operating margin rate in a low to mid 15% range. Information Systems third quarter and year-to-date sales were down about 3%, consistent with our expectations. Third quarter operating margin rate was comparable to the prior year period. The sector continues to perform very well and is maintaining strong operating income and margin rates. Based on year-to-date performance, we expect IS sales of approximately $6 billion, the midpoint of our prior guidance range, and we now expect an operating margin rate of approximately 10%. Technical Services third quarter sales rose 1% and year-to-date sales are up 3%. Third quarter operating income was comparable to last year, with a decline in operating margin rate due in part to lower income from an unconsolidated joint venture. For the year, we continue to expect sales of about $2.8 billion with a margin rate of approximately 9%. Turning to consolidated results. Segment operating margin rate was 12.1% in the quarter, and 12.4% year-to-date. Operating margin rate for the quarter was 13.3% and 13.4% year-to-date. Operating income and margin rates for both periods reflect lower segment operating income offset by higher net FAS/CAS pension adjustment and lower unallocated corporate expense. The increase in net FAS/CAS is driven by the impact of HATFA legislation last year. As I mentioned earlier, third quarter corporate unallocated expense does not include the impact of the tax methods change which will now increase fourth quarter unallocated corporate expense for state taxes by approximately $45 million. In addition to this state tax item, when we complete our state tax reporting process later this year, we expect it to result in a lower future state effective tax rate. This would reduce our state deferred tax asset by between $15 million and $40 million with $25 million being the most likely. This amount will flow through corporate unallocated. Based on these tax items, and our historical pattern of higher unallocated at the end of the year, we expect 2015 unallocated corporate expense of approximately $200 million. As a result of the methods change approved by the IRS this month, we expect our fourth quarter tax rate will move above the statutory rate due to lower deductions for domestic production activities. For the year, we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 31.5%, absent an R&D tax credit extension for 2015. We continue to expect a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 192 million for the full year. Looking at our EPS guidance for the year, we now expect EPS between $9.70 and $9.80. The higher range reflects strong year-to-date performance offset by the additional state tax impacts on unallocated corporate expense. Turning to cash. Before discretionary pension contributions, year-to-date cash from operations totaled $854 million and free cash flow totaled $520 million. Year-to-date cash is lower than last year due to timing of program collections. We now expect cash from operations of approximately $2.6 billion and free cash flow of approximately $2 billion. This considers $600 million in capital spending versus our prior estimate of $700 million. Just a quick update on pension items. Based on the demographics update completed in the third quarter, we are increasing our net FAS/CAS pension adjustment to income of approximately $335 million. Net plan asset returns through the end of last week were a bit above 1%. However, assuming 2015 plan asset returns of zero and a 4.5% discount rate for 2016, we would expect net FAS/CAS pension income of approximately $240 million versus our prior 2016 estimate of $475 million. Under these assumptions, FAS essentially doubles to about $600 million and our CAS estimate increases by about $75 million to $840 million. Our prior estimate was based on our actual 2015 discount rate and expected plan asset returns of 8%. We have a couple of months to go before we finalize our assumptions but further for your modeling purposes, a 100 basis point change in return on assets impacts FAS expense by approximately $50 million and a 25 basis point change in our discount rate impacts FAS by about $70 million. Steve, I think we're ready for Q&A.
Stephen C. Movius - Treasurer & Vice President-Investor Relations: Thanks, Ken. As a courtesy, each participant should limit themselves to a single one-part question and return to the queue for additional questions. Kaitlin?
Operator: Your first question comes from line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.
Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks, good afternoon. Congratulations on...
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Myles
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President: Hey, Myles.
Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: ...those contracts. Wes, on the reorganization, can you talk to the financial side, the logic of if there is cost savings and if there is cost to do it, and also any go-to-market strategy that's also underlying the reorganization?
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Sure. Yeah. The go-to-market strategy I think is the most important part of this, so I'll address it first. As we've looked at the vector that we see our customer needs traveling along and we project forward on that vector, it's pretty clear that we're going to continue to see a convergence of capabilities that are needed in all of the solutions that our customers are going to be requesting or requiring. I think it's a sort of a natural vector of technology, if you will. So we want to make sure that as we think about our internal structure, there isn't anything that is in anyway inhibiting, of course as a first priority, addressing those technology opportunities and capabilities. But more importantly, we really want to make sure the structure that we have actually enables our company to be in a great position for creating those future offerings. And that's really the underlying strategy here and it's offerings both in terms of the products themselves as well as the service offerings, which are increasingly complex because of the nature of the capabilities that are being fielded. So that's the underlying strategy around the reorganization. It better integrates and aligns our capabilities in the directions that we see our customer community going for the long-term. And I will tell you it's generated a lot of excitement within our company. I think our employees have been seeing this vector and are delighted to see the opportunity to take a fresh look at how we are coming together as an enterprise to ensure that we are very, very well positioned for the future. The second part of it, I'll let Ken address in a bit more detail. Let me just say at a top level, generally, in our industry, our cost savings translate into affordability advantages over the long-term. But Ken, let me ask you to comment specifically on this situation.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President: Yeah. Myles, appreciate the question. And we certainly do expect that the realignment will result in cost savings over the longer term. I will remind that we don't give guidance on 2016 or beyond at this point and we will give 2016 guidance in January. And at that point, we should be able to further address longer term impacts. But we do not expect a material impact on cost for 2015, and I will say that any cost impact is reflected in our guidance.
Stephen C. Movius - Treasurer & Vice President-Investor Relations: Kaitlin, next question?
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi.
Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hello, everyone. Good afternoon and congratulations.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Jason.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President: Thank you.
Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): I just have a bigger picture question. One of the things that we heard from the Secretary of the Air Force last night in the press conference was the idea of open architectures and mission packages that can be competed. So I know you're not going to talk about Long-Range Strike, but I was wondering if you could talk about those comments in general, as it impacts the industry. What's DoD trying to do with all of this and what risks and opportunities does this present for industry and more specifically Northrop?
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: We're excited about the vector that the Air Force is taking on open mission systems and open architecture in general. And in fact, Northrop Grumman for many years has been strong proponent of that architectural strategy. And primarily because we see it as an important avenue for the insertion of technology over the lifecycle of any system, be it a platform or any other system actually that our customers are procuring. When you have an open architecture, and think about it in terms of some of the capabilities we all purchase on the commercial marketplace. In the cases where there really is an open architecture, it's much easier to get the apps you need. It's easier to do the upgrades that you need and, over time, it makes the capability that you initially acquire sustainable for a much longer period of time. So it becomes really an avenue for innovation and creates new engines of innovation within the defense community. And I think we're all excited about that because we know that we need those avenues of innovation to ensure that we maintain long-term technological superiority. So I think this is all integrated into the broader strategic thrust that we see taking place with our DoD customer and, quite frankly, with our intelligence community customers as well, that we need to make sure that we're doing the right things today with respect to the fundamental way that we're building things, so that we can take full advantage of this very rapid pace of technology progression, take full advantage of that in our security systems as we go forward. So we are strong proponents of it. It keeps us all on our toes because it takes off the table a lot of what historically had been proprietary systems that sort of locked one contractor into a particular configuration for a longer period of time. It creates a more ongoing competitive environment. But I think that's healthy. I think it's healthy for our industry. I think it's healthy for technology innovation, and I think it's really healthy for national security.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Doug.
Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi. I'm going to ask a very similar question to one I asked last quarter, which over the last few years and you just talked about it. You've completed the repurchase of 25% of your shares and that's been one of the great things that Northrop Grumman's done. But as we look at the balance sheet today, the cash on hand dropped below $2 billion a quarter ago and now it's down below $1.3 billion. Just trying to picture how this plays out in the future. What is the level of cash that you'd like to have on hand in general? And does this impact at all the way you think about share repurchases in the future?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President: Thanks, Doug, for the question. I would say that we have been burning down our cash balance as we've been executing on the repurchase program. And we have had some delays in cash collections in the first three quarters of 2015. We've historically had a significant chunk of our cash collections coming in the fourth quarter of the year and we see that trend coming again this year. So I think you'll see that we will build up additional cash balances between now and at the end of the year. We certainly like to maintain enough cash on the balance sheet for liquidity purposes and I probably won't throw a number as to what that is, but I believe we'll be strong generators of cash going forward. I believe we'll generate a fair amount of cash in the fourth quarter and I think, as Wes mentioned earlier, you can think of us as sticking with the same strategy in terms of deployment of cash and in particularly investing in the business, maintaining the balance sheet, and then returning excess cash through a competitive dividends and through share repurchases, and that doesn't change.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. I think Ken said it well. I mean the focus for us, number one, is generating cash. And so we're very focused on that across the enterprise. And secondly, being really smart on how we deploy it. And we think a component of being really smart is to make sure that we've got good cash return to our shareholders as part of the broader (25:25) equation.
Operator: Your next question in queue comes from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Good afternoon, everyone.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Noah.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Congrats on the big win yesterday; we were happy for you.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President: Thank you very much.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Any initial thoughts you'd be willing to provide on the direction of 2016 revenue and the segment EBIT margin compared to the current year?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President: No, I would say that again we are updating our guidance today for 2015, for the full year of 2015, and we're not going to give guidance on 2016 until January.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Ken, are you able to elaborate on where your underrunning the CapEx plan and any directional comments on what the trajectory looks like on a multi-year period?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President: I don't think I would be able to comment on particularly where the CapEx is lower. I would say it's just been lower across the board. And in terms of longer term, again we don't give guidance past 2015, but I will say and I think we've said in the past that we expect our CapEx to stay elevated for a number of years, and that continues to be our plan. That being said, we do also expect to generate a lot of cash in the coming years as well.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with RBC Capital.
Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thanks so much. Good morning.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, afternoon, or whichever time you think it is there.
Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Afternoon; sorry. It is afternoon. Wes, congratulations again on the win. (27:34)
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you. Thanks very much.
Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC: ...talk about detail. But I was wondering looking say more broadly if you thought that this may lead to some rejiggering of the industrial base in military aerospace, and whether you might be interested in participating in that.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: It's always hard to project how the vector of the industrial base will go over time. As I've said before, I do not believe that we are in a situation that perhaps we were in in the 1990s where single program decisions can cause precipitous actions by any of the players in the industrial base. We are today in a very different configuration because of the consolidation that occurred through the 1990s and the early part of the last decade. So I think that some of the commentary or speculation out there is perhaps rooted in an old way of thinking about our industry. We're in a very different place today. So I wouldn't be particularly focused on single event triggers. But that said, we're in a industry like every other industry that continues to shape, continues to change and, over time, I think it's really important that the industry itself figures out what is the best way of providing its products and services to its customer community. So I think that's the context for thinking about the world on a go forward basis, nothing is every stagnant. To think that it is would be putting your head in the ground. And it's important that the context of how to best serve the customers is front and center and, of course, the context of shareholder value. So, those are the considerations I think that will come into play as we continue to look at the future. Another really important avenue of thinking in that regard, though, to some of the earlier questions which I thought were really good questions goes to what's the vector of technology and what are the customer needs going to be. And as we are participants in a very high-technology industry here in aerospace and defense, the vector of technology has a lot to do with what the shape of the industry should look like just as it does in every other technology-driven industry, which is increasingly so many industries around the globe today. So, simply a view that things will continue to shape and change and it's important that companies that have a bright view of their future, like we do, think about that broadly and are proactive in that that regard.
Operator: Your next question in queue comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.
George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC: Yes. Good morning. I wanted to get two quick ones. Wes, on the reorganization, you had operated with four sectors and no COO, now we got three sectors and a COO. Should I conclude anything about how long you intend to stay around as CEO from that announcement?
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: George, let me say this. I am excited about our new organizational structure. We constantly evaluate our organization and I think you've seen over the course of my tenure that we've made a number of organizational changes. And we make those adjustments from time to time based on the approach we think's going to enhance our overall performance for our shareholders, our customers and our employees. And as we looked at this transition into a three-sector configuration, it became apparent to me that having a COO could be really helpful, particularly given the number of opportunities that we're looking at as we go forward. And that thought was also enhanced by the fact that we have such an exceptional leader in the person of Gloria to take on the role. So I am just excited as I can be about having Gloria come and join our team here at the corporate office to play such an integral role in helping us to move forward. Your question went to a little bit, I think, in regards to was there any implication there about me and my role. Let me just say this, I am so honored to have the privilege of working with the amazing people in this company. And that is something that I just absolutely enjoy thoroughly. So no one should read anything into the organizational changes that we announced with respect to my future plans. It's again from our perspective collectively, this organizational approach is the approach, we all collectively believe really positions us best to perform, because that's our number one priority in our company is to execute and perform. And also to be able to effectively realize the opportunities that we see both here in the U.S. and around the globe. So we're all excited about moving into this new operating structure and really excited about the future opportunities it represents for our company.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.
Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks very much. Good morning. Ken, you talked a little bit about delays in cash collection. I wonder if you could elaborate on that a little more, and if it's just kind of a timing issue, or we've heard that from another company as well, and whether it represents a different way of thinking on the part of your customer?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President: Thanks for the question, Seth. I would say that, for the most part, we're dealing with a timing issue in terms of cash. We've had some protracted negotiations that have taken a little bit longer to get closed. And we have seen some changes in cash terms from our customers and that's having a little bit of an impact in terms of delaying the cash flow on some of our programs. But I would say for the most part, it's really driven by just some protracted negotiations and a few things that have moved out to the right on us. We continue to believe that our full year guidance for both cash from ops and free cash flow is where it will end up. So, I think, we'll make it back in the fourth quarter.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS.
David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC: Good afternoon.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, David.
David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC: Just one clarification question, I guess, for our modeling purposes and then I have another question. Will the LRS-B program be reported within Aerospace Systems on a go forward basis?
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. So, I think I can safely say that Aerospace will report LRS-B when it finds itself in our numbers.
David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks. And then, beyond that, just think about Aerospace Systems going forward, can you just talk about maybe from a revenue perspective and a margin perspective the kind of transition that's going on there with F/A-18 coming down, F-35 ramping up, E-2D ramping up, kind of where are we in that transition both from a revenue and margin perspective? Thanks.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President: So, David, again, not giving guidance beyond 2015, but I will say that a lot of moving parts in the company and certainly a lot of moving parts at AS. You mentioned some of the things, F/A-18, yes, is coming down, F-35, E-2D ramping up. Some international opportunities starting to ramp as well. So a lot moving parts. Some of it is more mature production, some of it is developmental. And I would say that we always strive to perform and deliver higher margins and I think you'll see us continue to do that, but I wouldn't want to give you a specific number for sales or margin beyond 2015.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies.
Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC: ...very much. Wes, the change that you talk about in the organizational structure can only be done if you also get your customer to work with you and I'm going to use the JSTARS program, if I may, just for a paradigm for half a second. You clearly have a compelling solution from what we can see, you're ahead of schedule on it, you could provide the product tomorrow or one would think come darn near close. It clearly saves the customer a lot of money in operations and improves his capability. In the commercial world, it's a no-brainer what's going to happen. In the world of the Pentagon operations, they talk about better buying power, 4.0 or whatever, which is just a bureaucratic solution. So how do you break through these barriers so that, in fact, you can operate with more speed and agility and deliver both value to your customers, your employees, and your shareholders?
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Howard, I would just say, as always, your question is very perceptive. The challenge that we collectively face in our defense community is the challenge of sometimes inertia that's driven by the budgetary instability that our customers are having to deal with. I will tell you that when I get out and interact with the seniors in our defense community and the juniors in our defense community that there is an appetite and a strong desire to see new capabilities introduced much more quickly. And this inability to plan that we've been stuck with now for several years is, of course, impacting that in a negative way. So as we think about this repositioning of our company, we are taking the view that, of course, we've got to continue to perform and execute in the framework of the acquisition arena in which we are operating today. So there's nothing about the reorganization that slows our ability in any way, in fact I think it actually helps even in the current acquisition environment that we have today. But we, like others in our industry I would say, are anticipating that things are going to change again. And we see some early indicators of that. The work that's being done in each of the services to think in a different way about how some of the technologies and capabilities can be introduced, it's not at the rate any of us including those in the services would like to see happen, but it's happening. And it's happening in the intelligence community as well. And so as those of us who have been involved in our industry for a long time, can generally forecast a little bit, when you start to see the beginning of the things happening, they're on that vector. And again, we'd all like to push faster if we could and I think generally speed is one of our challenges collectively, but it's going to go in this direction. And we want to make sure that we are out in front of it. We want to make sure that customers are never in a place where they're having to pull us along when it comes to technology and architectures and systems. We want to be in front and helping them and see the future. And that's exactly what the structure is organized around. What I experienced, I think a little bit more directly to your question with respect to the how you do it. I think what you have to do is you actually have to put the new thinking on the table as alternatives. And it has to get introduced early enough into the acquisition process where they're seen as viable alternatives, alternatives that can be pursued with manageable risk. And that's really the challenge that we all have is to get some new thinking on the table, get it matured in a manner that the risk can be understood and be seen as managed and in reality be managed and therefore enable some different acquisition approaches. And I think there's great enthusiasm for this. And hopefully – and this is, I think, the hardest part – hopefully, we'll get to a place in the budgetary environment where we're actually enabled to support our servicemen and women at the speed of technology that increasingly our adversaries are doing now every single day. So I think it's actually a national security imperative that we get this on the right track.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yes. Let me join those, Wes, in congratulating you, a terrific job.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Cai.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: Given that the decision came out yesterday after the markets closed, is it fair for me to assume that it is not included in your guidance for this year?
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: We gave guidance today, not yesterday. So, our guidance today is our guidance. So I would say it that way. But we obviously have had plenty of time to think our way through all of the implications, and that's where we are.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. And so, it is included – I think you mentioned to David that it is included in Aerospace. It would be – if and when everything moves forward, it will be included in Aerospace.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. That's correct. That's the home of the B-2 Spirit Stealth Bomber, that's the right place to put the new one.
Operator: Your next question in queue comes from Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good afternoon.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good afternoon.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President: Hi, Sam. How are you?
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: All right. I'm going to try and sneak two in, which was just one, Ken, have you mentioned in the past what the CAS growth looks like into 2017 just so that if we use the new baseline for 2016 to just think about that? And then secondly, just in two of your segments, both Aerospace and Electronics, you're coming in at the high end. So, I'm just trying to think about what you might have, I guess, factored differently. What's coming in forward or is this being pulled from 2016 or is something else coming in a little bit better?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President: Okay. Sam, in terms of the CAS growth question, we did – on our prepared remarks earlier, we updated our 2016 CAS estimate and I mentioned $75 million increase for 2016 based on where we see the market today in terms of returns and in terms of discount rate. We are not updating our guidance beyond 2016, but last year, we did have 2015, 2016, and 2017 on our Investor Relations webpage, but we are not updating that at this point in time. In terms of your second question about AS and ES coming in at the high end of the range, I think at this point, it's really just better visibility into what we see the year is going to look like. We've had some risks in the plan that have been burned down. So nine months into the year, I think really it's just about better visibility. We're satisfied with the volume as it's coming in at all of our sectors and looking forward to completing the year and getting ready for 2016.
Operator: Your next question in queue comes from Richard Safran with Buckingham.
Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Hi. Good afternoon. And once again, congratulations.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President: Thank you.
Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: You know what: it's not – it's somewhat related to LRS. Wes, last quarter, we talked about things like JSTARS recap, T-X, UCLASS, things like that, et cetera. Given the resource demand for the LRS-B program, I just wanted to know if this win maybe precludes you from bidding on other work near term. What I'm just trying to wonder here is if you think your plate is full with this contract. Any color you could provide on how you're looking at new opportunities now would be helpful.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, I think it's a really good question and we are a very responsible company in that regard. We take a careful look at our capacity to take on anything that we're bidding and we will never go out and make a bid on something where we have any reservations about our ability to execute. And so we thought a lot about this actually now over the last several years: how do we think broadly about that range of opportunities? And our conclusion is that we do have significant capacity, in large part because of sort of the natural transition that we've seen in development to production. And in fact, I will tell you that one of the concerns on the downside of some of these programs has been that if they slip too long or were delayed too long, what the implications would be not only in our company but in other companies around the inherent design capacity that's such a national asset. So take for example, F-35, we've been very, very active in the overall design activities on F-35 both in our role in the center fuselage as well as our role in sensors and in comms and navigation equipment, and we've been shifting that well into production now. So the design capacity from that activity has been available. Look at E-2D, E-2D in a similar state where we had been rather substantially focused on design activity for some time and we've moved E-2D successfully into production. Triton, we are now going through the test program, so our teams that had been focused on our Triton programs from a design perspective are tailing off on the design side of the activity. So when we go through our portfolio and look at these transitions from design to production, which are great, that's exactly what we want, that's the reason we take these programs on, so we actually produce things. But when we look at that capacity that we have inherent in our company, we see substantial capacity. So we are very interested and very eager to continue to support our customers in pursuit of programs like Joint STARS and the new trainer and UCLASS across the board. And we think it's important that we continue to leverage that very extensive design and manufacturing production capacity that we have in the company to support these activities because we all know when we are operating with our capacity very productively employed, we're going to be operating much more efficiently and that efficiency brings affordability. So, we continue to be very excited about those new opportunities as well.
Operator: Your next question is queue comes from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.
Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: Hi, thanks for getting me in, appreciate it. Have you guys gotten a chance to have an early read on whether or not some of the language included in the pending budget legislation is going to have an impact on some of the pension assumptions? I know you said that you're not going to talk about 2017 FAS/CAS just yet, that's fine. But just in terms of the language in the budget itself, I believe there's some language relating to pension smoothing. Does that going to impact any of the HATFA legislation or the FAS/CAS timing or anything like that or is this sort of unrelated to how FAS/CAS rolls through for you guys?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President: Thanks for the questions, Hunter. I think that – we have looked at that language, there's a couple things in there that would impact us. One being the pension smoothing and the other being the change in the rate that you pay for the – the premiums paid. We don't believe the impact of the premiums is material to us going forward and as far as the pension smoothing, haven't fully analyzed it but I think it's good news and likely results in funding that would be required in the out years moving out another year.
Operator: Next question in queue comes from Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse.
Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Well, good morning.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Rob.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President: Hi, Rob.
Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Guess I should say good afternoon and congratulations.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Rob.
Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Wes, I wanted to go back to something you addressed early on in the monologue, which is the services side and your commitment to the business in the context of the realignment. And what I wanted to get at here, we know you've de-commoditized the business, but what are some of your objectives here? Is it more of a revenue, a cross-selling opportunity to drive a higher growth rate in that business as the budget inflects? Or is there at the same time a margin opportunity, does the combination allow you to get to double-digit margins consistently going forward with these two businesses combined? Thanks.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: That's a good question. Yeah, and let me just say it is primarily a strategy driven decision in that we see this class of service and solution offerings that often go with it on the backend of program deployments when we're thinking about modernization and other activities. We see this as integral to our offerings and the way we do business with our customers. We never want to be in a place where we're unable in some way to support our customers post-delivery, nor do we want to be in a spot where we have customers who are seeking some of these higher end services that ultimately over time translate the thinking into what the next systems will be. We never want to be in a spot where we can't support them. So your question's right on target because it is a really important part of our overall company strategy to be in the high end of the services market. We think it's important for any company that's going to be a full provider to those customers to have that capability and to be active in the marketplace. And as we look at where those service offerings are going as we look into the future, we think it's going to be important to have that breadth of capability that we'll have in our new Technology Services organization that encompasses both the hardware and the software domains. And again, this is thinking about more the integrated offering that we'll be providing. Now, we are going to be constantly challenging the team on their margin rates, because we are participating in that higher end of the marketplace. It's clearly an important focus of this new Technology Services organization to generate the margin rates that we see are attainable in that space. As Ken said earlier, we're not going to guide for our new configuration yet, we'll do that at the beginning of the year. But just as we have challenged all of our businesses to compare themselves to the marketplace that they are strategically positioned in, we'll be doing that with the services part of the portfolio and incentivizing the team to do better than what the market suggests they should be able to do.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton.
Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC: Hi, guys.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Pete.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President: Hey, Pete.
Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC: Just wondered if (52:57) you'd give us your updated cash tax expectations for 2015, and then also maybe your cash pension initial look for 2016? Thanks.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President: Pete, I probably wouldn't want to give the cash tax number. It's not a number that we guide to. I will say that we do expect our 2015 effective tax rate at 31.5%. I will say that the methods change that we implemented this year is something we did in order to lower our cash taxes. And we see that as helping us on that perspective and I think you'll see the number when we get to the end of the year.
Operator: Your next question in queue comes from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel.
Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Good afternoon.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, Joe.
Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Wes, I'm wondering if you could just talk a little bit about the focus on the international business just in terms of what the pipeline looks over the next 12 months, maybe remind us how much of the business right now is international? What the bookings have been year-to-date and maybe how much of the backlog is international? Just some more color there would be helpful?
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. That continues to be a really important part of our – not only our business today, but our future in our company. And I've mentioned on some of our calls in the past the importance of international to us is a core element of our strategy. Today, it's right around 15% for 2015. And as we think about the opportunity set that's out there, I think I've mentioned many of these in the past, we're especially excited about the growth vector that we see in Aerospace Systems internationally both our unmanned systems, Global Hawk, and then over time Triton being the standouts there, but also with some of our manned platforms and in particular, E-2D. So if I look at – let me go back to the unmanned for just a moment, as we look forward, we're excited about the opportunity in Japan on Global Hawk and Australia continues to be very, very interested and positive on Triton. We are seeing some increasing interest in Triton from our European allies. So, we believe there is a very good trajectory internationally in our unmanned business. And E-2D Japan is probably the first up with respect to our international opportunity set on E-2D and I think that's going to be a really important part of it. So, we like the growth trajectory, the potential that we see for AS internationally. We also see really good opportunities around the globe in what we now call our ES and IS businesses which are going to be coming together into our new Mission Systems business at the beginning of next year. With respect to the Electronics component of that, I think you're familiar with many of the things that we've been doing with radars around the globe. And when we're looking at the F-16 fleet in particular, the SABR radar capability that we now are moving out with several parties already. We are seeing continuing growth in the interest in that. With respect to our current Information Systems business, we also see a lot of opportunities whether we're talking about C4I or some of the air defense capabilities that IS has. TS is also very active internationally and we have a long-standing global footprint in our Technical Services business and we see opportunities for growth there, both in the Middle East and Asia-Pacific that we're pursing quite aggressively. So, this is a really important part of our business, an important part of the way that we are working to create our future. And I've been delighted with the focus that we've been able to achieve across the company in finding the right avenues for growth internationally.
Stephen C. Movius - Treasurer & Vice President-Investor Relations: Hey, Kaitlin. I think we're going to do one more.
Operator: Your next question in queue comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.
George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC: Yes, I was just wanting, Ken, there was a big drop in EACs in both Aerospace and Electronics, now does that have to do with the gain last year? Maybe you could explain a little bit further?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President: Thanks for the question, George. I will say that we've been working to get more of our EAC adjustments into what we kind of refer to as our baseline. So, as EAC adjustments occur, they get into your run rate margin. And so we've seen some of that. Our baseline margin rate without EAC adjustments has been going up, which I think is a positive thing. And in terms of the comparison from last year to this year, I would say I don't think there is anything particularly significant. It's just timing of items that hit in last year and items this year as well as the increased baseline earnings. We look at our business really in terms of our operating margin and operating margin rate and not with respect to what our EAC adjustments are. Just thinking back to the comparison, I guess the biggest impact last year to this year in terms of EAC adjustments would be the HATFA legislation last year that resulted in reduced pension expense for our sectors last year and therefore higher earnings and those EAC adjustments occurred in third quarter. But other than that, I think it's just timing across the sector and continued good performance in our baseline EAC margins.
Stephen C. Movius - Treasurer & Vice President-Investor Relations: At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Wes for closing comments.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: All right. Thanks, Steve. I just wanted to wrap up by saying I'm very proud of how our team is performing. I think this quarter demonstrates another good quarter of very solid performance and represents the focus that we have across our enterprise on ensuring that we're doing the right things to continue to drive sustainable performance well into the future. And I'll also wrap up by saying what I said earlier in the call, congrats to our Bomber team, just outstanding, amazing outcome here that we're also so very proud of. We really appreciate all of you joining on to our call today. And thank you for your continuing interest in our company. Thanks, everyone.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Our first half results reflect a continued focus on performance by the great team we have in our company and I'd like to thank our folks for all that they're doing. That focus on executing well in combination with effective cash deployment continues to create value for our shareholders, our customers and employees. Looking at the quarter, earnings per share increased 16%. Cash from operations and free cash flow were also higher this quarter. Through June 30, adjusting for the first quarter pension-free funding, operations generated about $300 million in cash versus $170 million last year. Strong performance from all four of our sectors combined to generate strong segment operating margin. We also continued to execute our cash deployment strategy. During the quarter, we repurchased 6.8 million shares for $1.1 billion. Year-to-date, share repurchases totaled 12.1 million. And we are now approximately 90% complete toward our goal of repurchasing 60 million shares by the end of 2015. In total, under the program we announced in May of 2013, we've repurchased more than 54 million shares at an average price per share of just under $121. We're on track to complete the 60 million share repurchase by the end of the year, market conditions permitting. In addition to deploying cash to significantly reduce our share count, in May, we raised our quarterly dividend 14% to 0.80 per share. Year-to-date, we've returned $2.2 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, while continuing robust IRAD and capital investments. Our capital deployment priorities continue to be investing in our business, managing the balance sheet, maintaining a competitive dividend and returning excess cash to our shareholders through share repurchases. We believe these priorities are serving our shareholders and the company well. We ended the quarter with total backlog of $37 billion, slightly lower than last quarter, but 4% higher than we were at this time last year. Through June 30, bookings totaled approximately $10.7 billion, giving us a book-to-bill of 90% at the mid-point of the year. International customers continue to express strong interest in our products and services, and we see opportunity for long-term profitable growth through both our existing portfolio, with programs like F-35 and E-2D, Triton, and SABR radar, as well as through a robust global opportunity set of new programs. We continue to expect international sales to increase to approximately 15% of 2015 sales. Here in the U.S., we are competing for the nation's next generation Long-Range Strike Bomber. We believe we are well positioned to continue our successful 35-year partnership with U.S. Air Force on long-range strike systems. Our B2 bombers are combat proven and we've been consistently upgrading and sustaining them. Other important new opportunities here in the U.S. are programs like common infrared countermeasures, long-range discrimination radar, Trainer-X, the Joint STARS recapitalization and JCREW. As a company, we have a well diversified portfolio of existing programs in future opportunities. No single program is a must win for us. The breadth of our portfolio addresses many areas of investment priority for our U.S. and international customers. But our customers rely on budget clarity to plan and execute their priorities. Our rational orderly U.S. defense budget process will go a long way towards supporting execution of the Pentagon's strategic spending plans to ensure our national security. We encourage congress to address the artificial spending constraints imposed by the Budget Control Act, which are negatively impacting our nation. Given the current status of budget negotiations and the limited congressional sessions remaining until the end of fiscal year 2015, we expect to begin fiscal year 2016 with a continuing resolution. Unless congress acts to address the BCA, we may also see sequestration triggered in January. Despite these ongoing budgetary challenges, we continue to be focused on performing for our customer, shareholders and employees. Based on the strength of year-to-date results, we are raising our EPS and cash guidance. We now expect 2015 earnings per share of $9.55 to $9.70 and free cash flow of forward discretionary pension pre-funding of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion. In light of the prevailing budget uncertainty and the likelihood for a continuing resolution in our fourth quarter, we're maintaining our sales guidance of $23.4 billion to $23.8 billion. So now I'll turn the call over to Ken for a more detailed discussion of our results and our guidance. Ken?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Wes. I also want to thank the team for a job well done. It was a solid quarter and we're on our way to having another strong year. Second quarter EPS increased 16%, which includes a one-time tax item. We recognized $38 million of additional research credits in the quarter, which provided a $0.20 benefit to EPS. Excluding the tax benefit, earnings per share increased 7% over last year's strong second quarter. Our segment operating income for the quarter was unchanged and segment's operating margin rate increased 30 basis points, reflecting strong performance across all four of our businesses. Total operating income was slightly lower than last year, due to lower net FAS/CAS pension adjustment, while the operating margin rate increased 20 basis points to 13.8%. I would note that our unallocated corporate expense for the quarter was lower than last year's second quarter, but on a year-to-date basis, unallocated corporate expense is consistent with last year's results. Turning to cash. Operations generated $626 million in the quarter and $297 million year-to-date before the voluntary pension pre-funding. This year's results are consistent with our pattern of having the majority of our cash generated in the second half of the year. Second quarter free cash flow was $511 million after capital investments of $115 million. Turning to sector results. We had strong performance across the board. Aerospace Systems sales were slightly higher in the quarter and year-to-date. We continue to see growth in our unmanned and space businesses. Year-to-date unmanned sales are up more than 10%, while space sales are up around 5%. These increases were partially offset by declines in a number of other programs, the largest of which was the F/A-18. Year-to-date F/A-18 deliveries have declined to 17 from 25 last year. Ramp-up on production activities for the E-2D is partially offsetting the F/A-18 ramp down in military aircraft programs. Aerospace's operating income and margin rate were also higher for both the quarter and year-to-date. I would note that this quarter's operating income includes the benefit of risk retirements on a restricted program, and based on first half results, we now expect an AS margin rate of approximately 12% versus our prior guidance of high 11%. Our revenue expectation is unchanged at $9.8 billion to $10 billion. Moving to Electronic Systems. Second quarter sales declined 3% and are comparable on a year-to-date basis. Operating income and margin rate were solid in both periods and continue to reflect the changing business mix that is more heavily weighted toward development and cost-plus type work. Our guidance for ES is unchanged. We continue to expect sales of $6.7 billion to $6.9 billion with an operating margin rate in the low-to-mid 15% range. Information Systems' second quarter and year-to-date sales were also consistent with our expectations. The sector continues to perform very well and at the midpoint of the year, operating income and operating margin rate are slightly higher than last year despite a low single digit sales decline. Due to the strong performance, we are increasing IS operating margin rate guidance to the high 9% range versus our prior guidance of mid-to-high 9%. We continue to expect IS to generate sales of $5.9 billion to $6.1 billion. Moving to Technical Services. Second quarter operating income and margin rates are comparable to last year on slightly lower sales. Year-to-date sales are up about 4% primarily due to higher international and higher intercompany sales in the first quarter. We are raising sales guidance for Technical Services to approximate $2.8 billion from our prior guidance of a range of $2.7 billion to $2.8 billion. We continue to expect a margin rate of approximately 9% at TS this year. On a consolidated basis, segment operating margin rate was 12.6% for the quarter and 12.5% year-to-date. We are maintaining our guidance of approximately 12% for the year. While our year-to-date total operating margin rate was 13.4%, we're maintaining our guidance of mid 12% for the year due to anticipated changes in our tax methods for Federal tax ratios. While the methods change, shift taxable income into the future and possibly impacts our 2015 cash guidance, it negatively impacts our 2015 P&L in two ways. First, it results in a non-recurring increase to unallocated paid taxes of around $45 million, most of that will likely flow through our third quarter unallocated corporate expense. As a result, we expect unallocated corporate expense of about $200 million for the full year 2015. The methods change will also move our effective tax rate higher in the second half of the year and closer to the statutory rate due to lower reductions for domestic production activities. As a result, we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 32% this year. So, for your modeling purposes, third quarter results are expected to reflect the majority of the $45 million non-recurring increase in unallocated corporate expenses, and our effective tax rate will be closer to the statutory rate. The last EPS guidance item I would like to note is that we now expect the weighted average diluted share count of approximately 192 million shares for the full year. Looking at our EPS guidance for the year, we now expect EPS between $9.55 and $9.70. The higher range reflects strong first half performance, the tax methods change and the lower expected share count than our prior guidance. We're also increasing the guidance for cash from operations and free cash flow. Excluding after-tax discretionary pension contributions, we now expect cash from operations will range between $2.6 billion and $2.8 billion and free cash flow will range between $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion. With that, Steve, I think we're ready for Q&A.
Stephen C. Movius - Treasurer & Vice President-Investor Relations: Thanks, Ken. In order to allow time for everybody in the queue to get through, please limit yourself to a single question with one follow-up. Kaitlin?
Operator: Thank you, Steve. Your first question in queue comes from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi, good afternoon, everyone.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, Noah.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hey, Noah.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Ken, maybe just a little bit more detail or some follow ups on those outlook components. So, understand the unallocated, nonrecurring, the tax rate change, is that also nonrecurring or what does that do to the tax rate beyond 2015? And then the change in cash from ops and free cash, is that all just cash taxes or is it something else? And then does that sustain or not beyond 2015?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: So, on the corporate unallocated, that is a nonrecurring as is the impact on the income tax rate, Noah. It's just moving income from 2015 to 2016. As we changed the method, it'll continue to push income out 2016 to 2017. So, essentially it's a one-time cash benefit, but we don't have to pay it back in the future, and we will then realize the benefits of the state and those federal deductions in 2016 and beyond.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Is it possible to perhaps, I know you don't want to commit to numbers beyond 2015, it's too early to do that, but perhaps there is a sort of directional break own you could provide. On average, the next few years, the base business converts net income into free cash at X% and then between tax and pension or anything else that's a major bucket, what would drive you off of that regular conversion one way or the other?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I would say, Noah, we wouldn't want to comment really beyond 2015. In terms of – you asked about CAS, in terms of CAS, I think there's some information on the website that has some directional data for CAS purposes for 2015, 2016 and 2017, but I don't think I'd want to comment beyond that.
Operator: Your next question in queue comes from Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein.
Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Good afternoon.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, Doug.
Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: You have taken net debt up substantially over the last year, and I'm just trying to understand where you want to be in terms of a stable level of cash on the balance sheet going forward?
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: And so, Doug, let me just kind of frame in a broad sense, because I don't think we want to pick one particular number. We manage the company based on the broad environment that we see. And from a net debt increase perspective, we made a decision in 2013, and we followed through on it, that based on the attractiveness of the debt markets to our company at the time, it made sense for us to change our balance a little bit, go out and take on a little bit of additional debt and use that for share repurchase. We've been doing that and I think that's served us all very well, and we have a very regular rhythm, if you will, to looking at where we are from a total debt position and what it means in terms of the way both we're operating the company as well as what our overall capital structure looks like. So, we want to retain some flexibility in that regard; that's why I don't want to drive a stake in it at any one point in time. But, in general, I would just say our philosophy is, we want to make sure we're obviously respecting and treating our debt holders the right way. But we look for the right economic environment and circumstances to position our overall capital structure in a way that we think it creates the most value.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: And, Doug, I'll just mention that certainly we look to maintain more than a comfortable level of liquidity, certainly first looking at cash on the balance sheet and then beyond that additional credit capacity. But, I would say that we're very careful in looking at our expected cash flows in determining when and where we make those investments and maintaining a comfortable level of liquidity.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: And that's important given the nature of our contracting business that we ensure that we've got access to adequate cash to deal with the ups and downs of the budget and the appropriation process, and I think we have a pretty good model for how to do that actually. It's a barely detailed model we use to project what our needs may be and add of course some risk factors to that. So I think in terms of cash on the balance sheet, our approach to managing that is serving us quite well.
Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: But is that fair to say then that the level you're at right now is the level that you're comfortable with and I ask because as you finish this year and complete the 25% share repurchase effort, you look at the cash levels and the question we have is to think about what's the next step, whether you do beyond the completion of this current effort?
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. And I appreciate that question as well Doug. It's clear to us that we are going to be, assuming that the growth continues in the factor that we foresee it, continue to be a very good generator of cash as we have been for a number of years. So, your question is a really important question with respect to cash deployment and I think it's appropriate to take a perspective on that now and just kind of layout where we are. As I said in my remarks, we're about 90% complete on the repurchase program that we announced back in the middle of 2013 and at that time you laid out the objective of repurchasing 60 million shares which turned out to be about 25% of our then outstanding shares. So, right now obviously we're very focused on getting done what we said we would do and that's our primary focus for executing on that and the team is very focused on making sure we complete it. And this most recent program, while it's been at a higher run rate in terms of the rate that we purchase than our prior repurchase activities, it really is a continuation of the cash deployment strategy that we've had in place for a number of years and it goes directly to your question about cash generation and what do we with that. And as I said in my remarks, our priorities are the same today as they have been. First priority, always invest in the business where we could see that we can get a good return on that investment, but we're also focused on managing the balance sheet and we're clearly focused on ensuring that we're paying a competitive dividend and we've generally been targeting that in the 30% to 40% range of pension adjusted earnings and then with the excess free cash flow we have been very proactive in returning that excess free cash flow to shareholders via share repurchase. So as I again said in my remarks, I think that's working out well for us. In fact, it's been that way for quite some time if you turn the page back to a little bit over a decade ago, once we get this current program finished off, we will have retired about that – about half of the total shares we had outstanding a little over decade ago. So, you can take a look at how we've been doing over a long history of how we're deploying our cash and I think you can get the sense – we kind of like that strategy. We've been consistent I believe in both articulating that strategy and in executing the strategy. So we don't have any new announcements to make today. I'm not in a place where we're going to say, okay after this program, it's done, here is what we're going to do. We're focused on getting this program, but I think you can judge by our past actions over a relatively long period of time how we assessed and act on our cash deployment priorities and to your point that cash deployment is supported by a very robust approach to cash generation. So, I hope that answers your question, perhaps in a little bit broader context than you asked it, but that's the way we're thinking about our company right now.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi.
Jonathan Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi. Good afternoon. It's actually Jon Raviv on for Jason. I was wondering if you could revisit some of those long-term margin targets by segment that Jim used to talk about and how they might be affected by some structural shifts in your business, i.e., more international and more aftermarket services linked to your platforms?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Sure. Happy to talk about that, I would say that I think our long-term objectives in terms of margin rates for the sectors continue to be relevant, and as we look at our business going forward, we see in some respects offsetting factors. We have some level of domestic development work that we see in front of us, and we have some more mature production work in terms of – particularly international opportunities, but other opportunities with E-3D and F-35 starting to ramp in those areas as well. So, we have a little bit of a mix in terms of – potentially lower margin development work and higher margin production and higher expectations on international. That should offset, and I think that's because of those factors that the objectives that we've laid out continue to be relevant.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. I would just add to that the numbers that we've talked about over time I think are still meaningful, those are benchmarks, benchmarks that we see as representative of the way the businesses can perform based on a marked view of where we've been and how the industry performs. Let me be clear, we incentivized our team to be better than the benchmarks and that's our core part of the strategy in the company. But as Ken pointed out, there are pressures in both directions whether it is the mix of development and production that we have pressing in one direction or the growth in international pressing in a different direction, but it's our job to manage all of those things. And as I said we measure ourselves on how well we do and that goes directly to the way our incentives work.
Jonathan Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): And as a quick follow-up on talking about services, services not necessarily linked to your platforms, how do you approach that portfolio in light of your competitor or one of your competitors suggesting they want out of that market?
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: But we've been a very active manager of our portfolio for many years now on both, I would say the products and the services sides of the company and I think that portfolio management has been working well for us. It's included taking a variety of actions, selling and spinning out businesses, as well as sometimes simply exiting some of our efforts through attrition. And those portfolios of actions have moved us largely out of the low margin commoditized service businesses. In fact, if you look at IS and TS where the majority of our service business resides, those sectors today are reporting operating margin rates in the range of 9% to 10%. So I think that shows you what we've done already in terms of managing that part of our portfolio. I think it's also important to add that we see our remaining service businesses as really important in supporting our efforts with our products business. So, there is really good strategic alignment of the different parts of the business in that way. Just to give an example of that, if you look at the service businesses at IS and TS somewhere in the range of 80% to 85% of that service business is with our DoD and our Intel customers. So we think we've found the balance and mix that's working well to support our broad strategy. We do of course continue to be active portfolio managers and we are constantly testing alignment or asking ourselves whether we're the best owners of each of these businesses and we also work hard just in a broader context to ensure that any decision that we make whether it's a decision to exit or a decision to retain any particular business that such a decision actually enables shareholder value creation based on the market conditions at the time. I think that's a really important part of the thought process.
Operator: Your next question in queue comes from Howard Rubel with Jefferies.
Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC: Thank you.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, Howard.
Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC: How are you both – all three of you?
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Good.
Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC: Since we're talking strategic, you guys do a nice – the company does a nice job of integrating airborne vehicles. And you look at opportunities and Sikorsky came on the market and there's elements that might very well fit with you. So could you elaborate on what some of the considerations you undertook – because clearly it does have a cash positive contribution to Lockheed now that they've acquired it?
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Howard, I appreciate the question. We have a very strict policy that we adhere to that we don't give specifics on any particular transactional activity in the marketplace. But I think I can answer your question in a broad context. We are active and looking at a variety of things that come onto the marketplace. And to your point, we are very thoughtful and our very first thing that we go to is really fit with the strategic factor that we see our company on and how we see individual elements of both our current portfolio and anything that we're particularly looking at how we see those things fitting together to create value. Often times, we can see something that if you will from an architectural or engineering or how we sell something, we can see it fit together, but we can't get to the create value part, at least not in a relative sense to our other opportunities to deploy those resources that would be used in a particular transaction. So we're strong adherents to that create value part of the equation and we're – as we look at a variety of different possibilities out there, we're just adamant that whatever we do honestly stacks up well against our other alternatives, so that's kind of the way we frame our thinking.
Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC: I appreciate both the discretion and the deliberate answer. Now, I want to just ask on operational question for a second.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Sure.
Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC: You've – there's a lot of money – well, there's an enormous amount of opportunity with the UCLASS program and the Senate has provided – basically has created you as, at least one of the viable opportunity or solutions there. Could you sort of discuss how you see some of the unmanned vehicle market playing out from here? I mean, you're clearly the leader and you clearly have some very nifty solutions and it's been an important part of your growth as you outlined in the quarter.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: It is an important part of our growth. It's a very important part of our company and I honestly think we're still at the early stages of understanding collectively from a defense and security and perhaps even more broad perspective how unmanned systems and more broadly, I would say autonomous systems are over time going to play an increasing role and performing the missions that our nation and our allies need to perform. On the target though of your question with respect to airborne unmanned systems, the growing recognition that the surveillance needs are continuing to expand and it's not a linear expansion, it's higher rate than that. Those needs are continuing to expand to address all these challenges that we're seeing around the world, really is a direct connect into the strength of what unmanned can bring; the ability to operate with persistence, the ability to use the extra capacity, if you will, of a platform that you obtain by removing the need to support a humanoid and replace that with mission capability, all of those things play very well. And to the true effectiveness of these unmanned systems and as we've been demonstrating on Global Hawk, our ability to bring the operating costs down on these systems to a place where the cost equation is so incredibly attractive, I think is going to only continue to grow. As these systems grow and their operational utility, we'll be able to continue to bring down both the cost of creating the systems as well as the cost of operating these systems. So we are at the early stage and I appreciate it that you mentioned UCLASS. UCLASS was a phenomenal set or UCAS, the predecessor to UCLASS. UCAS-D was a phenomenal demonstration of what these things can do, and it wasn't just the fact that we were able to both take off and land an aircraft on an aircraft carrier, this thing was a flying wing that we used to takeoff from land. And for those who are students of aeronautical engineering, you'll understand how much harder that is than just doing any aircraft. So this was quite a demonstration. And then to follow that up with a demonstration of the ability of UCAS-D to go up and get refueled in flight with a tanker, it's just a big big step forward that we're seeing in these systems. So I believe we've got a lot in front of us. Where this will all go will be a mix not only of technology, but also of policy and operating doctrine, and sometimes those arenas are not as fast paced as the technology is. So I think we have to be thoughtful and recognize that there are a number of things that are going to pace it. But the work that's being done, for example, in the U.S. in terms of aerospace integration that the FAA has taken on, I think is another signal of the growing recognition of the importance of this class of technology. So I'm excited about where this is going. Our team is clearly excited. We are continuing to make sure that we're doing the right things to invest in this technology, both in terms of its development capability, but also in terms of our ability to produce it economically, and we see a bright future for unmanned systems.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you very much. So, Wes, with your share repurchase, your net debt to EBITDA has increased from a very modest level to a slightly higher level, still comfortable. As you think beyond completing the announced share repurchase, what do you think the correct gross or net EBITDA, debt-to-EBITDA ratio is for the company? And how should we think about the potential for continuing the share repurchase after the current one is completed? Thanks.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hi. Cai, let me kind of provide a similar perspective to the response I gave Doug on a similar, I know not exact question. In terms of looking at the variety of metrics, whether it's the amount of cash we want to maintain on our balance sheet to ensure the robustness of our operations, or if we're thinking about important metrics like debt-to-EBITDA, this is an ongoing process for the company. We take a very careful and thoughtful look at how our overall capital structure plays into what we're trying to achieve strategically as an enterprise and then what the consequential outcomes are for so many of these important metrics, and what those mean for our broader strategy and for, of course, our board and for our debt holders. We're very thoughtful on both fronts. So, we haven't put out there any particular hard benchmarks on these things. We think it's important for us to be able to maintain some flexibility to deal with a changing environment that's out there, but we recognize our responsibilities to manage these things very carefully. And we are very, very mindful of all the elements of the different metrics and how they are understood and relate to the way that they have potential impacts for our shareholders and our debt holders. So, with respect to share repurchase on a go-forward basis, as I mentioned earlier, we're proud of our history. Our look back on that of how we performed on it, I think is quite positive. And that history does inform our thinking about the future. And that's kind of where we are today as we move forward and have more to say on it. We'll certainly continue to be clear and to articulate our strategy. But we're comfortable with where we are today and it seems to make sense in today's environment.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: Wes, should I take from your answer that how you approach it in the future will be heavily influenced by your success or lack thereof with the bomber competition?
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: We really haven't linked those types of broad strategy questions ourselves to individual programmatic outcomes. Cleary, when we look at the integrated impact of all of our programmatic positioning, we include all of those considerations in terms of our overall cash deployment strategy. As I mentioned earlier, our priorities forecast for deployment remain the same; investing in the business there's always first. If we can see an opportunity to invest and get a great return through those investments, that's where I like to put the first dollar. But we're very prudent about that as our criteria for applying that dollar is the same as if we were doing something else different. We look at where we can get the return, and part of the reason for being in business is to deploy cash inside the business and to generate great returns and we're doing that. We see quite a few really good opportunities. You mentioned one of them. There are a number of great opportunities that we have in our company, and it's exciting actually to be in a place where we see such an array, both domestically and internationally, of opportunities. But that being said, as I indicated in an earlier response, we do anticipate very solid cash flows in our business, and we would expect that as we go forward, we're going to continue to have capacity to do a variety of things with those cash flows in alignment with those priorities that I've delineated.
Operator: Your next question comes from Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.
Sam J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good afternoon.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: How are you, Sam?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hi, Sam.
Sam J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hey. Wes, you kind of made a comment about the current situation with the budget resolution and starting with a CR and that's led you to not change your sales guidance. And I'm just trying to just think through, I wouldn't think you'd get that quick of a turnaround and just want to confirm if there is some sort of resolution or if they get money through OCO, is there any scenario where that ultimately would help you in 2015?
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Sam, I'm glad you asked the question, because I think it's important to clarify. When we are in a mode of a CR, particularly one that has on the back end of it a potential sequester, it's usually not so much the actual flow of dollars from an appropriation standpoint that impacts us in the near-term, it's more the way our customers are thinking about what might happen. And we've seen a little bit of this in past years when we were in a CR situation and there was a lot of uncertainty as to whether or not Congress would act with respect to removing the BCA caps or what the sequester implications might be. So this is more about our customers willingness to put things on contract or to allocate funds on existing contracts and we'll just kind of have to see what the environment looks like over the next number of months. As always, we're making sure that we are planning for a variety of scenarios. So we don't expect to be caught short, if you will, in any respect with how things might play out. But that small extent of volatility that's represented sort of in the range of our guidance is our thinking around, if we see something similar at this time to what we observed a few years ago when there was this uncertainty of what could happen, when you are in a CR with a potential sequester at the end of it, I think it's prudent for us to be clear that there is some potential uncertainty in that regard.
Sam J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thank you. And then just on some of the changes within the segments and I guess for Ken is really if it looks like Aerospace is up, Technical Service is up, you get some sort of a cash benefit from the tax change that you're talking about. Is there anything that's on the negative side or is it those three items that really are affecting your free cash flow guidance for the year?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I would say Sam that in terms of cash flow guidance for the year, I think the cash we expect to generate from the sectors is pretty consistent with what we expected at the beginning of the year and the update to the cash flow guidance is primarily tied to our change in tax methods, which is going to result in lower tax payments for the full year of 2015.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.
Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks, good afternoon.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, Myles.
Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: First, just sort of clarification – hey, the clarification on the lower share count. Is that buying more upfronts, lower dilution or are you going above and beyond the $60 million this year?
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: For the most part that's buying little bit more upfront than we have planned Myles.
Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. The question, maybe Ken is on the implied margin in the second half in both IS and AS respectively, 100 basis point plus sequential declines second half over first half and IS has some of that seasonality, AS generally doesn't, I heard you call it the one time in AS, but still it looks like there is more conservatism than not. Can you help us bridge that?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yeah, thanks, Myles. I appreciate the question. So we did increase guidance somewhat at both AS and IS largely based on the performance in the first half of the year. You mentioned IS had some help from risk retirements on a restricted program as we disclosed. And IS had some positive impacts from program completions and that's both in the first quarter and the second quarter. Also, I'll just mention that year-to-date margin rates for ES and TS approximate their 2015 guidance. Other point I would make is that, our segment margin rate is approximately 12%, so it's not a point estimate at 12%. In terms of other thoughts, we do have the potential, as Wes has mentioned, for some customer behavior changes in the second half of the year, more likely to impact our short-cycle businesses, but we're keeping eye on that risk as we think about what our 2015 segment margin rate is. All that being said, we incentivize our team to perform on this, and several other metrics and certainly look forward to working with a team to continue to focus on managing risk and capturing opportunities in the second half of the year.
Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with RBC Capital.
Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thanks so much. Good afternoon.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, Robert.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hey.
Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Wes, you mentioned that you expect to expose this year to make up roughly 15% of sales. I was wondering how much of that is already in the backlog, and also where you think this percentage could hit, maybe hit into next year?
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: So, in terms of the backlog, I think pretty much all of it is reflective in our backlog today. So, I think it's a fairly straight forward projection for this year. We're not guiding it to next year. All I would say though is, international continues to be a growing part of our business. We're excited about the opportunity space that's in front of us and I have in the past sort of clicked through some of those things that might give us the opportunity of your question just to remind everyone of kind of what we see out there. We've earlier this year announced already the Global Hawk in Korea and I see that as a really important first step in the growth of unmanned for our allies. We have Japan very interested in Global Hawk. They made an announcement earlier of their interest. Australia, as well, has announced their interest in Triton. Germany is now taking a hard look at Triton as well. So the whole arena of unmanned, particularly in the surveillance space I think is going to be a very nice set of opportunities for us. I mentioned Japan, not only are they pursuing Global Hawk, they're also pursuing E-2D and E-2D is a platform. I believe we will see a number of opportunities emerge for us around the globe. It is a remarkable capability that Navy is very successfully deploying and utilizing, and I'm sure that a number of our allies around the globe are going to be quite interested in that. Electronics, which historically has been our strongest business in terms of the fraction of its sales that are international, continues to see a lot of opportunities. The SABR program that we announced earlier in Taiwan is one that I think we're going to see some nice opportunities around the globe. Cleary, Korea, is one that is in the near term, more near term than some of the others, but I think that's representative of the breadth of abilities that ES is bringing to the international marketplace. And then both IS and TS have a variety of opportunities out there as well, whether we're talking about air defense systems or we're talking about sustainment opportunities or in some cases the cyber opportunities. So it's an important and growing part of our business and we're delighted to be able to serve our allies in a more robust manner.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: And then, Wes, just to mention, to add on to that, I think that we have international opportunities, we also have a robust set of domestic opportunities as well depending, the international opportunities do at times take a little bit longer to turn into sales, so depending on what moves first, in terms of domestic, we talk about LRS, F-35 ramp up, E-2D ramp up. Depending on what moves first, you could see international growth with domestic growth out pacing it potentially in one year or another.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Sure.
Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. That's great. Thank you very much.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Richard Safran with Buckingham Research.
Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Hi, good afternoon.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good afternoon.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hi.
Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: So, I have just one question, but it's really kind of a two parter here. Wes, obviously the main focus right now on procurement is Long-Range Strike Bomber, but you recently teamed with L-3 and GD on JSTARS recap, which you mentioned by the way in your opening remarks. So, first thing, is the fact that, a bunch of teams has now been formed, any indication that the program is moving forward? If you could, can you give us some sense of a timeline and maybe size of the program that sort of thing? The second part is, if you mentioned T-X in your remarks, the new trainer, I missed it, but I thought you might give us an update on the program and your current thinking there? And in your answer if you could add any new initiative of the programs that you are focusing on now that I might have missed?
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Sure. Thanks in terms of Joint STARS, first let me start up by saying we're delighted to be able to team with both General Dynamics and with L-3 to pull together an offering that we think will just do an outstanding job of meeting the requirements and doing so in a very affordable manner. So, we're delighted with that partnership and looking forward to the competition. The other competitors that have announced so far, my recollection of that is, both Lockheed and Boeing have announced their interest in this competition. So that'll make it a very good competition and we're looking forward to putting together a very competitive offering. The current state of play on Joint STARS is all public information. The Air Force has indicated that they're planning to award a development contract sometime in 2017. I think right now they're talking about towards the latter part of 2017 and then play it out from there in terms of getting to production or production representative aircraft and then roll that on into production over the course of 2020s. So, we're focused on two things. Obviously, we have responsibility and accountability for maintaining and sustaining the current fleet of Joint STARS, but we're off the belief that the new program can move along as quickly and should move along as quickly as the Air Force can support it from a funding perspective, and in fact we think the nation would be served well by moving it along very quickly, because the technology is ready and it's a matter of integrating and getting the aircraft flying. On T-X, that too continues to move forward. There we're delighted to partner with BAE Systems and I think as you may have read a little bit or seen some of the coverage in some of the industry trades, we're focused on a new development type aircraft, and we're looking forward to having a bit more to say about that in the coming months. But, we believe we'll be able to put forward a very compelling offering there as well. I would tell you that the Air Force has been indicating, continuing to indicate that T-X is an important priority for them, and that they're going to continue to be supporting that in their overall budgeting approach. So, we're looking forward to being able to compete on that, and provide I think a very compelling offering there as well.
Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Thank you very much.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you. Thanks, Richard.
Operator: Your next question in queue comes from Carter Copeland with Barclays.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hey, Carter.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, good afternoon.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good afternoon, Carter.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Couple of just clarification details, Ken, on the AS performance in the quarter. I wondered if you could just sort of tell us which was the bigger grower in absolute terms, unmanned or restricted? And then, a second one on the in-theater force reductions in IS, which has obviously have come up in several quarters in your description, how much more downside do you see there for that business, and are we getting close to a bottom related to that? Thanks.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Sure. Carter, no problem. At AS, I would say, the largest driver for the quarter was unmanned in terms of top-line what drove the performance for the quarter. And then, your second question in terms of in-theater, the biggest in-theater impacts that we see are at IS and the ES, and we project about a $200 million reduction this year in-theater sales to, I think it's about $700 million for the year. And actually last year the bigger piece of that reduction was that IS. This year, the biggest piece of that reduction, probably two-thirds, is ES just as the different programmatic and programs that they have in-theater are ramping down. So that's where we see it for this year and $700 million is kind of the baseline for 2015, and beyond that we haven't yet, I would say, put pen to paper on what that would look like.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. I'll stick to that.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Carter.
Operator: Your next question in queue comes from Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse.
Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Afternoon.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, Rob.
Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi, Wes. Wanted to go back to capital allocation, but I'm not going to ask you what you're going to do next from a buyback perspective. But instead, ask you if the environment stabilizing here might make M&A a little bit more interesting, not talking about specific deals, but just your overall view about what's out there, especially given just the size of these very binary opportunities in front of you and dependent on how those might go.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, I think it's very possible that a shift in the environment may cause a variety of additional opportunities to become present in the marketplace, but for us the question would always be value and whether or not anything that we're looking at stacks up well relative to our other alternatives. As I've said in the past, and I feel that way today, when I look at our footprint here in the U.S., I really don't see a big burning hole in our portfolio in some way and that therefore puts us in a position where we feel really good about our portfolio. Our decisions are really genuinely going to be value based, and we really have to see the business case for something to make sense for us. So, the thrust of your question was whether there may be more opportunities coming into the marketplace, and yeah, there may very well be, the question will be how will they stack up relative to other alternatives.
Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Obviously, the value part of that answer makes a lot of sense. But considering just again you've been focused on the stock and that value equation has changed over time with your success with the stock, so can we at least assume that that hurdle rate for alternatives changes relative to your valuation?
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, I think you have to look at all the alternatives. Clearly, we talked about our interest and our history on share repurchase. We also look at our dividend, but we also look at investing inside the company where we have a lot better insight into what the possibility of return is and we have a lot more ability to affect that outcome. So I didn't put all the words into the prior answer. I would add the word risk adjusted return. We really do think about the risk part of the equation as well when we think about overall value. But as we go forward, we'll continue to look at what our long-term view is of the company's valuation. The answer to your question is, yes, clearly our share repurchase program has been a big part of our success in generating value for our shareholders, but history has not yet ended. We keep looking forward and are convinced that we have a lot of opportunity on a go-forward basis to continue to generate value, and we take that longer term view when we think about share repurchase. We're not just looking at the price as of today; we take a longer term view, and that served us really well. As I said, we've been at this now over a decade and our average price of repurchase over that decade looks really really effective compared to where we're trading today, and we think about our share repurchase program with that type of very long-term view.
Stephen C. Movius - Treasurer & Vice President-Investor Relations: Kaitlin, I think we'll do one more.
Operator: Your next question in queue comes from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.
Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: Hi, guys. Thanks for getting me on; I appreciate it.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Hunter.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hey, Hunter.
Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: Good morning – well, good afternoon. I know we've talked about this, so I'll try and ask it a little bit different way. On long-range strike, in the event that you are successful, can you give us an idea of what type of incremental CapEx you might be looking at? And in the event that you're not successful, I know you said that you are not going to necessarily change the way you think about capital allocation per se in a vacuum, but would that change the way you think about M&A in the context of being maybe a buyer or a seller? Not necessarily would it raise the appetite to engage in it, but would it change the way you think about it? Thanks a lot.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Sure, Hunter. I'll take the first part of the question and turn it over to Wes for the second. In terms of capital, we've talked about the amount of capital expenditure that we expect to incur in 2015. We've talked about a number around $700 million. We think that's – at this point, we think that's a reasonable number of where we are for the year. And given what we've seen publicly about the timing of an LRS award, I don't think that impacts us significantly one way or the other. I would say that we don't provide guidance beyond 2015, but one way or the other as Wes mentioned we do expect to be strong generators of cash flow whether that's cash from operations or free cash flow as we project out beyond 2015.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: And Hunter on your question regarding whether a outcome on LRS would change our perspective on M&A, let me get to what I think is underlying some of the questions we're hearing in that regard and that goes to essentially the question of scale or top-line growth. And I'll say what I've said so many times in the past, we do not manage our company on the top-line. We manage the company based on value creation. In fact, over the last number of years, we've taken a number of actions that have very intentionally reduced our top-line, because we saw those actions as accretive to value and that's the way we're thinking about our overall value proposition. So the question of – if we're not successful on one thing or another and perhaps that means our sales are not growing as quickly, do we try and make that up some way with M&A, that's not the way we think about it. What we do think about is look at each of the alternatives that we see that are available to us in one way or another, stack them up against our priorities, stack them up against risk-adjusted value creation opportunity and make our decisions on that basis and that's the way we're going to be doing.
Stephen C. Movius - Treasurer & Vice President-Investor Relations: Great. That concludes the call. I apologize we didn't get through the queue. I will be in my office for anybody who wants follow-up call. And with that, Wes, I'll turn over to you for final (59:04) comments.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Okay. Thanks, Steve. I'll just wrap-up by saying what I said at the beginning of the call. Our team across the company is absolutely focused on performance, and that focus and commitment is really serving our shareholders, our customers, and our employees really, really well. And I'm very, very proud of what our team is doing, and how they are getting it done. We certainly appreciate all of you joining us on our call today and we also appreciate your continuing interest in our company. Thanks for joining us, everyone.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's First Quarter 2015 Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. My name is Kaitlin and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Steve Movius, Treasurer and Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Movius, please proceed.

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Wes.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We're off to a good start in 2015. Our team generated solid operating results, and I want to thank our employees for their continued focus on execution. We generated earnings per share of $2.41 comparable to last year after adjusting for the $0.23 non-recurring tax benefit in the first quarter of 2014. These results reflect solid operational performance and the effectiveness of our cash deployment strategy. Sales rose 2% and reflect higher revenue at Aerospace, Electronic Systems and Technical Services. During the quarter, growth on existing and new domestic programs and double-digit international sales growth more than offset declines in mature production programs like the F/A-18. Sales for the quarter also benefited from a few more working days in this year's first quarter. In the first quarter, we repurchased 5.3 million shares for $859 million. In total, we distributed nearly $1 billion to shareholders this quarter through share repurchases and dividends. As of March 31, we've repurchased 47.5 million shares or nearly 80% toward our goal of retiring 60 million shares by the end of this year, market conditions permitting. Before our $500 million pension contribution, cash from operations was a use of $329 million, an improvement over last year's first quarter. After capital spending of $117 million, our pension-adjusted free cash flow was a use of $446 million. The first quarter is typically our lowest in terms of cash generation. We continue to expect healthy cash for the year, and we are maintaining our full-year guidance for cash from operations and free cash flow. Total backlog increased to $38.4 billion, a modest increase from year-end and a 6% increase from total backlog at the end of last year's first quarter. Net new awards totaled $6.1 billion, and we had a solid 1.03 book-to-bill for the quarter. Electronic Systems had a book-to-bill of 1.17 and Technical Services had a book-to-bill of 1.90. You'll recall that on last quarter's call, we mentioned a large international award that Technical Services booked at the beginning of the year. Electronic Systems received an award to supply our SABR radar to Taiwan, received long-lead material awards for F-35 lots 9 and 10 and won the contract to develop SEWIP Block 3, the next-generation electronic warfare upgrade for U.S. Navy surface ships. During the quarter, Aerospace Systems received awards for E-2D and restricted space programs. And Information Systems received awards for additional restricted cyber work, and we won the recompete for the follow-on to our IDENT program in the UK. We continue to see healthy demand for our products and services, and we have a robust global opportunity set for all four of our businesses. International opportunities for Aerospace Systems include Global Hawk and Triton for sublimations. We are underway on Global Hawk for Korea. Japan selected Global Hawk and included it in their budget. And Global Hawk made its international air show debut at the Avalon Air Show in Victoria, Australia. Japan also selected the E-2D and included it in their budget. And we are realizing international sales opportunities for F-35 and for Electronic Systems' SABR radar. Information Systems' C4ISR and cyber capabilities and Technical Services' logistics and modernization offerings are also attractive to our international customers. We are competing for U.S. programs like long-range strike, common infrared countermeasures and long-range discrimination radar to name a few. And we are ramping up on production programs like the F-35 and E-2D. In unmanned, we continue to expand autonomous technology with our X-47B unmanned combat air system. In addition to being the only unmanned vehicle to autonomously perform aircraft carrier takeoffs and landings, last week, the U.S. Navy successfully demonstrated fully autonomous aerial refueling with the X-47B, marking the first time an unmanned aircraft has refueled in-flight. In combination these achievements are a major step forward in unmanned autonomy with potential for both manned and unmanned aircraft applications. Autonomous launch, recovery and refueling have the potential for reducing operational costs in the future. We're proud to have again made aeronautic history and we congratulate the X-47B on another major accomplishment. The fiscal year 2016 budget process is underway in Congress, and we're pleased that there is a growing recognition of the need to support national to support national security in the budget. At the same time, we are concerned about the long term implications of the discretionary budget constraints imposed by the Budget Control Act. We continue to support the perspective put forward by the Administration that a return to the sequester levels and certainly the sequester mechanism would have a negative impact on our country. Congress is now negotiating a joint budget resolution. But we remain cautious on the budget process and customer spending later in the year. If a budget isn't passed, we expect we will begin fiscal year 2016 with a continuing resolution and sequestration may be triggered again next January. Based on first quarter results and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we are increasing our earnings per share guidance to a range of $9.40 to $9.60 from our prior range of $9.20 to $9.50. We are maintaining our sales guidance of $23.4 billion to $23.8 billion and our outlook for cash from operations and free cash flow is unchanged. So now I'll turn the call over to Ken for a more detailed discussion of our results and our guidance. Ken?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Wes. I also want to thank the team for a job well done. It was a solid quarter. Sales were higher, due in part to four additional working days in this year's first quarter. We generated strong segment operating income, awards totaled $6.1 billion and cash used during the first quarter was consistent with our historical pattern, although slightly better than last year. Turning to sector results. Aerospace Systems sales rose 3%, driven by double digit growth for unmanned programs and high-single digit growth in the space business. Volume was higher across a number of unmanned programs including NATO AGS and Global Hawk. Activity is ramping up on Global Hawk for Korea and Lot 11 for the U.S. Air Force. Growth in our space business reflects higher activity for restricted programs. These increases were partially offset by lower manned military aircraft sales, primarily due to fewer F/A-18 deliveries as that program continues to ramp down. Aerospace operating income and margin rate were strong relative to guidance for the year. First quarter operating margin rate of 12.6% reflects the timing of performance adjustments across our portfolio. For the year we expect AS will have a margin rate in the high 11% range on revenue of $9.8 billion to $10 billion, no change from prior guidance. Electronic Systems' first quarter sales increased 2%. The increase was driven by higher volume for space sensors, marine systems and tactical sensors, partially offset by declining volume for combat avionics. ES' operating income and margin rate reflect the changing business mix, which includes lower volume on mature fixed-price production programs like combat avionics. And higher volume for cost type development programs. As our portfolio evolves, we expect to continue to generate a strong, but somewhat lower margin than we've seen over the past few years. For the year we expect ES sales of $6.7 billion to $6.9 billion with an operating margin rate in the low- to mid-15% range, no change from prior guidance. Information Systems' first quarter sales were comparable to last year's first quarter and include higher volume for programs in ISR, integrated air and missile defense, communications and cyber. These increases were offset by lower volume for C2 and civil programs, including impacts from in-theatre troop drawdowns and lower volume on the CANES program. IS first quarter operating income rose 2% and operating margin increased to 10.5%. The quarter-over-quarter improvement is primarily due to improved performance resulting from risk retirements associated with program completions. Information Systems is off to a good start for the year, but as we look at the rest of the year, our guidance does contemplate some continued U.S. Defense budget risk. We expect short cycle customer spending may be cautious in the second half of the year due to budget uncertainty, particularly if we are operating under another continuing resolution in the fourth quarter. For the year, we expect sales of $5.9 billion to $6.1 billion with a margin rate in the mid- to high-9% range, no change from prior guidance. Moving to Technical Services, higher international and intercompany sales generated a 10% sales increase in the quarter. Higher international volume reflects the Ministry of National Guard Training Support award received at the beginning of the year as well as a full quarter of revenue from our IDS acquisition in Australia. Operating income for the quarter was unchanged. The lower margin rate reflects the fact that last year's first quarter included higher income from an unconsolidated joint venture. Excluding that item, operating margin rate was consistent with last year. For TS, we expect sales of $2.7 billion and $2.8 billion with a margin rate of approximately 9%, again, no change from prior guidance. The 2015 outlook for TS reflects lower volume for the ICBM, CNTPO and other logistics and modernization programs, which will be partially offset by growth in international. On a consolidated basis, first quarter segment operating margin rate was 12.3% which includes a higher level of research and development spending, which you'll see reflected in our G&A expense for the quarter. We take a total cost structure approach to our business, and we are managing this cost within our existing rate structure. This quarter's results support our guidance of a segment margin rate of approximately 12% for this year. Our total operating margin rate declines to 13.1% and reflects lower segments operating income, lower net FAS/CAS pension adjustment and higher unallocated corporate expense. This quarter's net FAS/CAS pension adjustment is higher than the guidance we provided on our fourth quarter call, primarily due to the $500 million discretionary pension contribution we made in the quarter which reduces FAS expense for the year. Our updated estimate for net FAS/CAS pension adjustment is $320 million versus our prior guidance of $290 million. You will recall that in early February we issued $600 million, 3.85%, 30 year notes. The proceeds of which were used to fund that contribution. The contribution generated a non-recurring increase to state deferred tax expense on our pension liability which is the primary driver of the quarter's higher unallocated corporate expense. One final note on pension, as is our standard practice, we will finalize our demographic survey in the third quarter and those results may impact that $320 million net FAS/CAS estimate. A quick note on taxes. Our first quarter effective tax rate increased to 31.3% from 26.3%. Last year year's first quarter rate included a benefit related to the partial resolution of the IRS examination of our 2007 to 2009 tax returns. I would also note that the first quarter tax rate was considered in our 32.5% tax rate guidance for the year. Looking at our EPS guidance for the year, we expect EPS between $9.40 and $9.60. The higher range reflects first quarter performance, the lower FAS expense resulting from the pension contribution, as well as our expectation that our weighted average share count would have climbed by about 9% versus prior guidance of an 8% decrease. Turning to cash, cash from operations was a use of $329 million in the quarter before the after-tax impact of the voluntary pension contribution. Cash used during the quarter was principally driven by changes in trade working capital. This is typically the case during the first quarter of the year, and we are seeing the same trend this year. Free cash flow before pension pre-funding was a use of $446 million, slightly better than last year despite an increase in capital expenditures to $117 million in the quarter. We continue to expect cash from operations of $2.4 billion to $2.7 billion before the impact of the after-tax pension pre-funding. This also results in free cash flow of $1.7 billion to $2 billion after expected capital spending of $700 million for the year, no change from prior guidance. In conclusion, it was a solid quarter and a very good start to the year. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve for Q&A.
Stephen C. Movius - Treasurer & Vice President-Investor Relations: Thanks, Ken. As we open up the call for Q&A, I would again ask each participant to limit themselves to a single question, and if you have any more questions, to get back in the queue. So, Kaitlin, can you open it up?
Operator: Your first question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi.
Jonathan Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Good afternoon. It's actually Jon Raviv, on for Jason.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Jon.
Jonathan Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Wes, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the growth outlook. Obviously, this quarter seemed to be – had some nice upside here. How do you think it trends going forward, what surprised this quarter and where could you see things going over the course of the year and into next?
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, we maintained our sales guidance for the year, I would say almost despite all the ups and downs that we see out there. I would say that this is a period of time where we do see a nice set of opportunities for our company, both domestically and internationally. I mentioned some of those in my prepared remarks. But when I think about what we're seeing – let me start with international, around the globe on unmanned infrastructure, our unmanned systems as well as our manned systems and more broadly, I would say, interest in the C4ISR capabilities that our company has to offer, I do see a nice continuingly positive trajectory for our international activities. As I mentioned in my earlier remarks, I also see some really good domestic opportunities, long-range strike. I mentioned the Kirkham program at ES is also a really interesting program for us as is LRDR. So, we have our guidance out there for the year. We obviously are addressing a lot of opportunities. But on the domestic front, I would also caution and I've mentioned this in my remarks as well, continue to caution about the budget environment. We need to work our way through this, see where we really end up as a country with respect to how we're going to be investing in defense and security on a go-forward basis. While I've been pleased that there is a growing recognition of the importance to appropriately fund defense and security, I am concerned about the budget process. And I think it's going to be a bit more time this year before we have any clarity as to how that's going to resolve.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.
Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. Morning – actually, afternoon.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, Myles.
Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: You went through kind of a laundry list of opportunity set, but you didn't mention T-X, and I think you guys are kind of – got a horse in that race – it sounds like it's a home-grown horse. Could you talk about that opportunity? And then just a clarification, in terms of mix between fixed pricing/cost plus at the company level, the last couple of years, you've been running with a pretty favorable mix, 47% versus kind of used to be 40% fixed price. Are we trending back towards the kind of 40% fixed price over the next few years?
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: All right. Well, let me hit both of those. On T-X, yes, that is a very important opportunity for us. Timing on that one is out a little bit relative to some of the others that I mentioned. But we believe we're going to have a very competitive opportunity on T-X. We see the development of the requirements that the Air Force has been going through to be very positive relative to the nature of the offering that we're putting forward. We're developing some really good partnering approaches in the program. So, it is an important opportunity for us. And we're certainly going to be very focused on this. With respect to the mix equation, as I've said before – and we saw some of this already in ES this quarter. We are delighted to be winning new program opportunities on our company. And we know, we all know that when we win these new opportunities, they start out cost plus. And that inevitably pushes that mix equation, Myles, that you're asking about back in the direction that it can have some near-term impacts on our margin rates. We're seeing that right now at ES. But this is exactly what we want to have happen. We want to be successful in capturing these new opportunities. And as we all know, over time those turn into production and that's clearly the longer-term margin opportunity.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Wes, maybe I'll just add that we've seen a pretty tight band in terms of our mix of fixed price and cost plus for the last few years. It is down a couple of percentage points this quarter and as Wes mentioned, particularly at Electronic Systems as we see some development opportunities there. But we do have a number of programs where production is ramping up, so it could be that we see that start to come back in the next or I'd say in the not too distant future. As we look at F-35 ramping, we look at E-2D and then...
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Mostly our international programs, our production oriented programs.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Right. And as Triton moves out of development into production in the near future as well.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rich Safran with Buckingham Research.
Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Hi. Good afternoon.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Rich.
Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Wes, I guess, I just wanted to ask you about your remarks at the beginning of the call on – and your outlook recently for defense spending. I'm sure you're aware several of your peers are talking about FY 2016 spending coming in maybe above the spending caps. Some talked about like some type of another Murray-Ryan deal or something, some such. If we did assume that spending did come in above the caps, just based on what you get, do you think this is going to impact the short cycle under your business or long cycle business? Do you get any sense of where the government priorities will be if there is incremental spending above the caps?
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yes, Rich. I appreciate the question. Let me first address the if we assume part. I want to be very careful about that because we have – as I mentioned earlier, we have a long way to go from here to there in terms of getting a real budget outcome that is above the BCA levels. I have optimism in that we are hearing more of the – what I think is the right kind of discussion about the need to relieve the BCA caps quite frankly, both defense and non-defense, to make sure we are not under-investing in our country either from a security perspective, a social perspective or a long-term economic development perspective. But we've got to get there. And I want to be careful about sounding too optimistic about that given the amount of time we still have in front of us to sort this out. But your question had an assumption behind it. If we assume that we end up slightly above the caps. I do think it will help the short-cycle business, as you mentioned, and that there is a fair amount of pent-up need for the capabilities that the shorter cycle businesses provide. And as you know, they took a harder hit in the downturn of spending. And consequently – historically anyway, they tend to more quickly show some recovery. But this is an interesting period of time, as well. The sequester and these BCA caps that we've been operating under have also impacted the nation's ability to actually go and do what we've been needing to do for a long time which is to fix the aging force structure that we have. We are at a point in time where our Air Force is the oldest it's ever been in terms of the age of the aircraft that are in the Air Force. And you can make similar comments for the Navy and for the Army as well. So, there is also a very large pent-up demand for actually buying new things, new capability, whether it's aircraft or ships or whatever it is, because we have been squeezing every ounce we can get out of these old systems. And so, that, I think, is also weighs heavily in the minds of those who are setting spending priorities in the Pentagon that we've got to fix this problem too. And I think it just reinforces the need for Congress to get on with it to address this unnaturally low position relative to a percentage of GDP that we're in in our discretionary spending in our country. So, I actually think getting relief can help both the short cycle and the longer cycle business.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada.
Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thanks so much. Good afternoon.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Rob.
Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hey, Wes. I don't know how much you can answer on this regarding LRS, but there has been some suggestions that whoever wins this, there could be some industry consolidation that occurs subsequently. What's your view on that?
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, I wouldn't even begin to speculate on things like consolidation or how other parties might react to particular outcomes. I would only say with respect to LRS, clearly it's an important program for our country. And consequently, all of those in our industry with the capability to support it are stepping forward to put on the table our very best. We feel good about our heritage in that regard. The B-2 program provides a great capacity within our organization to have a great currency of knowledge and understanding about what's really needed here. And we're doing that. We're working hard to provide the Air Force our very best offering on this. And we'll see with the outcome what it means for how different parties think about it. But I would also caution, LRS is – from our perspective, it's a really great program, it would be a wonderful opportunity. But it would just be one more part of a very diversified portfolio that we have in our corporation. And that, actually, is something I like very much about our portfolio; the breadth of capability that we have and the breadth of our programs. No single program is out there driving us in a direction. I think that our biggest today is 5% or 6%. So, I think that's also a healthy place for us to be for the long term. So, we would eagerly embrace the opportunity to go and execute on LRS for our nation should we be awarded that contract, but I would be careful about making prognostications that that alone has a reshaping impact on the industry.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.
Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: Hi, everybody. Thanks for taking the question.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Hunter.
Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: So, you're going to hit your $60 million share repo target by this year as you laid out. And sort of help us think about how we should think about modeling that going forward. You've been taking on about 9% of your shares over the last couple of years – I think this year and last year I should say. And the year before it was 8%. How are you going to manage that going forward? Is it going to be maybe to that percentage of share count level or is it going to be on a percentage of free cash flow? How should we think about modeling that when this particular authorization runs out? Thank you.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hunter, let me start off on that one. We do plan to finish our 60 million share repurchase that we announced a few years back now. We are looking, market conditions permitting, to finish that out this year. I will say that we have not made a decision on what we're going to do after that. We've got some upcoming board meetings and that will be something that we discuss with the board on what the future capital deployment looks like. But I will say that we've been repurchasers of our stock since 2003. Since that year we've repurchased I think about 48%, 47% to 48% of our outstanding shares. Can we continue to return capital to our shareholders at the same rate that we have been this quarter and last year? Probably not sustainable over the long term but you can think of us as a company that does return excess cash to shareholders.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. I'll just add a perspective as well. When we think about this, we do take the long-term view of the company. And we take a look at our ability to generate cash and how we best deploy that cash. And we take a very positive view of that. We see ourselves as an enterprise that should be able to generate healthy cash flows as we look into the future. And to Ken's point, if you look at our history, we have been a very proactive returner, if you will, of cash to our shareholders, both in the forms of share repurchase and dividends. So, I think you should think about us in terms of our history. We are a company that tends to continue to act in the way that we have been acting. And I think that's probably the best way of thinking about our future here. And we'll have to figure out the exact rate, as Ken pointed out, as we go forward. But if I turn the clock back to 2013, that was sort of an interesting opportunity for our company. We saw a place in the market where we could go and access the debt market and take advantage of that for our shareholders. And that's what we've been doing. So, that type of thinking on how we look at our overall capital structure and our use of cash proceeds, I think characterizes the nature of the decision-making that we have at the company.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein.
Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Good afternoon. On Aerospace, you said that the margins were down 80 basis points, and that was due to the less favorable performance. Could you talk about, is this a single-quarter issue or is there a mix change at all here? What's driving your margins and how do you see those playing out over the course of the year?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Doug, I would say that as we look at our performance in the first quarter of 2015 at AS, it was what I would characterize as strong performance for the AS sector, simply stacked up against a quarter in 2014 that was particularly strong. And we continue to think that our margin rate targets for the year at AS, the segment margin rate in the high 11%s continues to be appropriate. I think this is a good solid start to the year at 12.3% – I'm sorry – 12.6% in this quarter at AS. So, we're off to a solid start. As you compare it to 2014, it doesn't compare as favorably as we started off the year, really, really strong last year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey. Good afternoon, Wes, and welcome, Ken.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thank you.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I will stick to the one-question rule, but I want to have a part A and a part B, and it's with respect to the programmatic commentary you had in the release. And your comments on space and the double-digit growth there, I wonder if you might give us some color with respect to that double-digit rate restricted versus unrestricted, what was – were they both up? And restricted was just up more than the average or were they directionally different? And then secondly, in ES, I wondered if you might give us some color on if there were any specific programs that the combat avionics declines were related to? Thank you.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Carter, just to clarify, at Aerospace, the double-digit increase was at unmanned systems and the largest driver in that, as we mentioned, was NATO and Triton. But the space business, again, it's a healthy business. It's growing in the single-digit range in the quarter, largely driven by restricted. I believe that as we look at the space business, that clearly was the driver for the quarter. In terms of ES, I wouldn't want to get into specifics on a product line basis, but the lower volume at ES is in combat avionics, and I probably wouldn't want to dig any deeper than that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Good afternoon, everyone.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: How are you doing Noah?
Stephen C. Movius - Treasurer & Vice President-Investor Relations: Hey, Noah.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Doing well. How are you, Wes?
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Clarification on the share count guidance, the 60 million is net of share creep, correct? And is that off of 241 million that you ended in the first quarter of 2013 with? I think the release back then said 235 million. I guess another way of (33:15) fourth quarter of 2015?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. No. I would say that the 60 million share is a target repurchase number. As far as creep, I think we try to manage that pretty carefully. But the 60 million does not reflect offsetting creep, but we certainly take a look at that and manage that carefully. Essentially, if you think about it in round numbers, we were around 240 million shares at the time we announced it. We said we were going to reduce it 60 million or we were going to repurchase 60 million of shares, which was about 25% of the then outstanding shares.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel from Jefferies.
Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC: Thank you very much, Wes.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, Howard.
Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC: How are you?
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good. How are you doing?
Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC: Great. The change that you are making seems to be a little bit more of an emphasis on internal development and taking advantage of opportunity. And just as a preface, it seems that if you're managing the business such that there's an incremental to R&D and you're finding offsets, some of that could come about through use of IRAD to pick up might be the difference between a bid and an expected award that you end up receiving. So, I know it's a little bit of a lengthy question, but how do you think about making sure you're tracking this incremental risk? And who do you sort of make sure brings you bad news if, in fact, you do find there is some?
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Howard, it's a great question, and I very much appreciate you asking it because it is – I think it's indicative of the thinking that we all have to go through as we go through these cyclical processes in our industry. And to the extent that we see meaningful opportunities in front of us – and indeed we do – it is incumbent on us to take the actions to invest, to ensure that we can approach those effectively. We have that responsibility both to our shareholders and to our customers, to make sure that we are making the prudent investments. And we want to be very disciplined in how we make those investments, but the prudent investments to position us well to both capture and, of course, to execute on what we see in front of us. And I'll go back to some of the announcements we made last year and even a little bit earlier with respect to the investments that we've been making in our centers of excellence. We see those as fundamental investments for our long term to really get much of the promised benefit out of the acquisition of the various companies that we did over the years to really consolidate our footprint down, to co-locate our specialists who are working on these different opportunities, and to get the synergy that comes from having them really working these things together, and it takes money to do that. And those are investments that we've been making. With respect to managing the risk on these, we have a multi-faceted approach to doing that. First and foremost, we work hard to create a culture in our company where everyone feels not only the opportunity to put their hand up if they see a risk that we haven't been addressing aggressively. They also feel the responsibility to put their hand up. And so, we have a culture inside the company that is quite transparent in terms of folks at all levels focusing on risk management and also making sure that we are thinking as broadly as we can about both the risk and opportunity side of all of the things that we're taking on. So, in addition to the culture, we also have a very disciplined approach to doing risk management in the enterprise that encompasses management at all levels, making those risk assessments and communicating them forward. And our operating rhythm in the company is essentially based on reviewing both the risk and opportunity framework that we see across each and every one of our businesses. So, it's a baked in part of how we do business and to your question of who do I rely on, I rely on our team, our whole team. It is a core part of the way that we think about running the business, managing the risks. And I would point out because sometimes I am concerned that when I talk so much about risk management people, will hear in there risk aversion. It is not risk aversion. It's risk management. We know that to generate great returns, we've got to take prudent risks but we also know that we have to manage them appropriately. So, it is a key part of how we run our company.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yes. Thank you very much. So, you mentioned that there were four additional workdays in the quarter. Could you give us some numbers in terms of how many workdays you have, each of these four quarters than last year? And in a rough sense, sometimes when you have more working days, you don't necessarily have more shipments. A rough estimate of how much that added year-over-year to your revenues. Thanks.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks for the question, Cai. I would say that in terms of the additional workdays this year over last year's first quarter, we did have four additional workdays. Essentially 66 days versus 62 days. I would point out that we will have 365 days in the year and we'll give up those four workdays on the backend in the fourth quarter. In terms of identifying the amount of sales that came from those four additional workdays, we don't have a system that calculates revenues on a daily basis. I would say that probably had a larger impact on IS and TS as they are more labor-driven, but certainly could have had an impact on AS and ES if certain material receipts came in. But likely higher impacts on the IS and TS business. Again, we don't look at revenues on a daily basis, so I can't give you a precise number.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.
Sam J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good afternoon.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, Sam.
Sam J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: I hope you don't mind me asking a two-part question about capital allocation because the first one just – in terms of your decision about whether you continue beyond the 60 million shares, is it dependent on what happens with the outcome of the CR sequester or is it independent? And secondly, I didn't know if you could comment about the cyber business. Just that there's been a couple of transactions like Websense and Fidelis. And just thinking about – is it the type of thing you would have looked at and been interested in but not at those prices? Just anything you can share about that.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Sam, let me touch on each of these and I'll ask Ken to provide any other commentary that he may have on it. With respect to our future outlook on share repurchases, clearly, budget has an impact on the overall financial state of the company. A difference between the actual budget levels isn't going to necessarily suggest that we turn off all of our ability to return cash to shareholders. It's more a matter of degree. And as I said earlier, we really do look at our approach to share repurchase over a long period of time, and we take a look at our future cash flow projections and see where that puts us and how we think we can best deploy that. With respect to the cyber business, we always are looking at the full set of opportunities. We have, for some time and I see us continuing to do this, been very focused on ensuring that we are first and foremost supporting our U.S. government and, to a lesser extent, some of our international customer governments in cyber. So, that focus of ours that it tends to be on the high end of the cyber capabilities does not lead us down the path typically of looking at some of the properties that have come on to the marketplace that tend to have a little bit more robust component towards the commercial sector. So, I think this is really about portfolio philosophy and where we are focused, and we like our focus on the government side of it. We believe that that is helping us to continue to stay at the forefront of this technology. And as I've said over – actually over the years in this regard, where we find something that appears to have real commercial applicability, our first instinct is to go look to find the right partner, to use whatever capability we have in an approach that has a real channel to market and is operating within a company that's focused on commercial channels to market. We're a company that's focused on serving our government customers both here in the U.S. and around the globe.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Wes I'll just add on the corporate allocation, I think I would simply say we haven't made a decision on what is beyond the 60 million. I certainly wouldn't want to get ahead of the board, but we do expect to be long-term generators of strong cash flows.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS.
David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC: Good afternoon.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: How are you?
David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC: Well, good. Good. Wes, you've obviously been very aggressive about taking floor space out, taking head count down during the downturn. Potentially looking forward, as we get to a point where potentially the budgets start to grow again and potentially, with some of these programs coming through to you, how do you think about floor space, head count as we go forward? I know you're spending heavily on CapEx centers of excellence, but just more broadly kind of how are you thinking about that? Thanks.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: So, David, on the floor space part of it, I would say that what we were able to do over these last few years was to actually not only reduce floor space but drive efficiency. We've taken a very careful look at how we are populating the floor space we've had in the company and have used the current environment as really the opportunity to take a set of actions that, in hindsight, perhaps we should have taken years ago. But we took those actions to get us into a place where we are more efficiently utilizing the floor space that we have today. As we look at new program opportunities, we will have to look at how we increment, where appropriate or, even in many cases, even better utilize the floor space that we have. So, for every one of these new opportunities, we actually have a strategy that goes with the ability to use the floor space we have as well as, oftentimes, nearby or adjacent floor space. But what I think is nice is when we're looking at those strategies today, we're looking at them through the optic of the efficiencies that we're operating with today versus where we were some years ago. On head count, this is, I would say, oftentimes, the most challenging part of any activity that we take on in the company. The head count that – the employees that we hope to find, the new employees that we got to find in this space, are traditionally some of the most talented individuals in our country and now as we're becoming more international, some of those talented folks in each of the countries where we operate. So, we have to have a continued focus on making sure that we are bringing that talent in and retaining that talent. I will note that even though over the last four years or five years now, our total head count is down about 20%, because of the demographics in our company and in our industry, we've actually been hiring and hiring aggressively through this downturn. In fact, last year we hired just about 5,000 people in our company. So, our hiring machine is running and running well. And as we go forward, we're going to want to make sure that we are continuing to focus on bringing in the very best talent and keeping that talent. So, we've been giving a lot of thought to where this takes us over the next few years. But I think more importantly, we actually have systems operating within the company which I have confidence in producing the results we're going to need as we take on some new opportunities.
Operator: Your next question comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.
George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC: Yeah. My question is in the Q, you talk about unfavorable adjustments that's almost like double what they were last year. Is that one or two specific programs or just spread around or if you could just provide some more color on it?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hey, George. Thanks for the question. I would say that the unfavorable adjustments in the quarter are spread across a number of programs with no adjustment being significant. If there were a material adjustment in the quarter, we would disclose what that adjustment was and be discussing with you. So, no major issues, just we're continuing to work through the contracting process.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton.
Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC: Hi. Good afternoon.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Pete.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hello.
Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC: Hey, Ken, previously you guys gave a FAS forecast for 2016 and 2017. I'm wondering if the decrease in FAS for this year on the contribution, does that apply – can we extrapolate that to 2016 and 2017 as well or is the math not quite that linear?
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: The FAS expense benefit that we received this year generally would apply, going forward, in 2016 and 2017. But it depends on a number of other factors including our investment performance for this year, including the discount rate at the end of the year. So, I don't know that it would be fair to take that benefit; essentially we had guided $290 million, now, $320 million. So a $30 million benefit this year, for nine months of the year after we made the contribution. I don't know that it would be fair to take that and simply carry it forward given the multiple assumptions that impact the analysis.
Operator: Your next question comes from Joe DeNardi with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Joe W. DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good afternoon, Joe.
Joe W. DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Wes, I'm wondering if you could just provide us an update on F-35 and kind of where you stand, how performance has been recently. I think you said last quarter that margins were below the corporate average. I mean, what's the trajectory on that program? Is it volume that really is what you need to drive margins higher?
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: So, Joe, yes. F-35 continues to go well. We are delighted to see, finally, that we are beginning to come up the production ramp because, ultimately, at the end of the day, coming up the production ramp is what brings the cost down, makes the aircraft more affordable, and enables all of our partners around the globe to actually acquire the quantity that they need for the F-35 to become the cornerstone of their force structure as they envision it to be. As the production ramps up, it is our expectation that the F-35 margins should have the opportunity to improve over time. To your point, yes, they are typically below our average margins on the program, in part because of the place we've been in now for a number of years, of relatively low rate production, and quite frankly, contracting that matches that lower rate of production. But as we move on into real rate, we would expect that that rate and the approach to contracting it should enable us to have margins that are more traditional in terms of production rate margins.
Operator: Your next question is a follow-up from Jason Gursky with Citi.
Jonathan Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hey. It's Jon Raviv, again. Thanks so much for allowing the follow-up.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Sure, Jon.
Jonathan Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Just a question on CapEx. You ran – you underran the first quarter versus $700 million, I suppose, we generally see things ramp up towards the end of the year. So, if you could confirm that as being the case again this year. And then, just kind of looking out farther, should we see some (50:50) $700 million stick around, what do you think is normalized, is it all depending on what you win or you don't win over the next few months and maybe a couple of years, any further color on CapEx would be much appreciated.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hi there, Jon. Thanks for the question. If I can just talk about the Q1 number, I will say that if you look at our CapEx timing during the year, we do tend to start off a little bit slower as budgets are released. And I will say that last year, as an example, I believe in the first quarter we spent $60 million in CapEx towards a full year number of $560 million. This year, we started out Q1 at $117 million towards what we think is going to be $700 million. So, I think we're still comfortable with our $700 million target for the year. In terms of beyond 2015, I'll tell you that we don't give guidance beyond that point. We have talked about the fact that it will stay – capital is likely to stay elevated from where it was historically for a few more years.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Neal Dihora with Morningside (sic) [Morningstar] (52:02).
Neal Dihora - Morningstar Research: Hey. Thanks for taking my question. Just a follow-up on that F-35 thought process. I think you guys have given out sort of higher than 11% F-stream long-term Aerospace margins, and I'm just wondering if at what point in the production process of the F-35 would it actually be higher or lower. So, is that 11% inclusive of F-35 production or was it before that timing got sort of laid out there? Thanks.
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, Neal let me just be clear. The 11% is a long-term benchmark that we talk about that is reflective of how we see industry performing over a long cycle in the Aerospace sector, just as we've given benchmarks for our other sectors. Our team is performing above that benchmark and is incentivized to perform above that benchmark. So, you can see in the quarter, for example, we're performing better than the 11%, the 12.6% that we reported in this quarter is an example of that. The point that we've been making on the F-35 and because we have F-35 in each of three of our sectors, Aerospace, Electronics and Information Systems. When we look at that in the aggregate and compare it to our aggregate margin rate, that's where we see that offset. So, it isn't so much a sector by sector view. It is more of an aggregate view that the F-35 program isn't quite yet carrying its weight relative to delivering the margins that we have across the company. So, when will we get there? Hard to call. As I said, we are delighted to see the ramp up in the production as we go forward into LRS 9 and 10, but we really need to get to I think probably the place where we're really more routinely operating at this what we would envision to be full rate production before we are able to see the types of margins that we have historically seen in aircraft production programs.
Stephen C. Movius - Treasurer & Vice President-Investor Relations: Kaitlin, I think we'll do one more question.
Operator: Your next question is a follow-up from Carter Copeland with Barclays.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey. Thanks for the follow-up guys. I'm not sure if you said it and I missed it but I wondered if you could comment on what international growth was in the quarter and then I don't know if you disclosed it but what restricted sales were in the quarter year-over-year. Thank you.
Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Carter, thanks for the question. I don't believe that we generally discuss restricted sales on a quarter-by-quarter basis. And in terms of international I think what I'd be comfortable saying is that we believe full year sales for international are going to be around 15% of our total sales and we're not discussing the quarter-by-quarter impact of that. But we continue to believe 15% of our total sales that we've guided in the range of – for the year, the $23.4 billion to $23.8 billion is about where we see 2015 international.
Stephen C. Movius - Treasurer & Vice President-Investor Relations: All right. This concludes our Q&A. So, Wes, final comments?
Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Look, Steve, I'll just wrap-up by again thanking our team for a very strong start to the year. We continue to drive our focus on performance, ensuring our capabilities are aligned with our customers' needs for the long term and executing our cash deployment strategy. Thanks everyone, for joining the call today and for your continuing interest in our company.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's Fourth Quarter and Year End 2014 Conference Call. Today’s call is being recorded. My name is Katelyn and I will be your operator today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Steve Movius, Treasurer and Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Movius, please proceed.
Steve Movius: Thanks, Katelyn, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's fourth quarter and year end 2014 conference call. We’ve provided supplemental information in the form of a PowerPoint presentation that you can access at our website. Before we start, please understand that matters discussed on today’s call constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to Safe Harbor Provisions of Federal Securities Laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which are detailed in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risk factors may cause actual company results to differ materially. Matters discussed on today’s call may also include non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled in the supplemental PowerPoint presentation. I would also like to note that in 2015, our earnings releases will be in the fourth week of the month following the quarter-end due to reporting conventions. On the call today are Wes Bush, our Chairman, CEO and President; Jim Palmer, our CFO; and Ken Bedingfield, our CFO Elect. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Wes.
Wes Bush: Thanks Steve. Hello everyone and thanks for joining us. Before I begin my formal remarks today, I want to note that this is Jim Palmer’s last conference call as Northrop Grumman's CFO. On behalf of the Board; our leadership team and all of our employees, I want to thank Jim for his many contributions since joining Northrop Grumman in 2007. Jim has been an incredible partner in formulating our strategies; executing major strategic actions and driving the performance transformation. This created so much value for our shareholders; our customers and our employees. Jim has also ensured that we have the financial resources and flexibility to take advantage of our opportunities and on honor our commitments, which has been particularly important during the challenging budget environment of the last few years. But perhaps most importantly, Jim has been a steadfast advocate of ensuring we think about the long-term strength of our company and industry as he has a deep conviction about the importance of what we do. I want to personally thank Jim for his leadership; his dedication; and the energy and integrity he applies to everything he does. After we file our 2014 10-K, Ken Bedingfield will become Northrop Grumman’s CFO. And Jim and Ken are working to ensure we have seamless transition over the next few months. For those of you who haven’t met Ken, prior to joining Northrop Grumman, he spent 17 years at KPMG where he had roles of increasing responsibility. And just prior to joining our team, Ken was the national client leader of KPMG’s U.S. aerospace and defense audit practice. Here at Northrop Grumman, Ken led financial reporting and compliance as our Corporate Controller and Chief Accounting Officer. He also served as the Chief Financial Officer of Aerospace Systems, our largest sector. Most recently, Ken has served as Vice President Finance with all of our sector CFOs reporting to him. In these roles, Ken has also been a leader in executing our strategy of performance; portfolio alignment and cash deployment. And as CFO, he will play a more prominent role executing the same strategy going forward. So, congratulations to both Jim and Ken. Now, I’d like to discuss our 2014 financial results and our 2015 guidance. 2014 was another year of outstanding performance. And I want to congratulate the entire Northrop Grumman team on a job well done. Our focus on performance; cash generation and effective cash deployment produced strong results and shareholder value creation. We ended the year with sales of nearly $24 billion. While customer funding constraints continued to pressure our shorter cycle businesses, our longer cycle businesses were stable; and international sales growth helped to partially offset domestic funding challenges. In 2014, international sales increased 20% to approximately $3 billion or 13% of 2014 revenue. International sales grew at all four of our sectors. 2014 earnings per share increased 17% to $9.75. And on a pension adjusted basis, earnings per share grew more than 13%. Our businesses continued to perform growing segment operating income and expanding segment operating margin rate by 40 basis points to 12.9%. We ended the year with a total backlog of $38.2 billion, a 3% increase over year-end 2013 total backlog. 2014 new awards totaled $25 billion. We are starting to capture major opportunities in our international businesses. And at year-end, these awards represented 14% of backlog. We expect international revenue to grow to approximately 15% of sales in 2015, as our footprint continues to expand and demand grows for our unmanned and manned aircraft; electronics; cyber; sustainment and other offerings. In addition to the Republic of Korea’s contract for four Global Hawks, Japan has type selected Global Hawk to fulfill its high-altitude ISR mission and has also type selected our E-2D Advanced Hawkeye for its future advanced early warning and battle management mission. And shortly after the end of the year, Saudi Arabia awarded one of our joint ventures, reported in technical services a $900 million contract to the Ministry of National Guard training support. In addition, Information Systems was competitively awarded a seven-year IDIQ contract by the UK government to develop and deliver cyber security solutions in support of data security and information assurance. Cash generation and capital deployment are key elements of our strategy. In 2014, our operations generated $2.6 billion and after capital spending, free cash flow totaled more than $2 billion. We returned $3.2 billion to our shareholders or nearly 160% of free cash flow. We repurchased 21.4 million shares for approximately $2.7 billion which reduced our weighted average share count by 9%. And through the end of 2014, we have repurchased 42.2 million shares or approximately 70% toward our goal of repairing 60 million shares by the end of 2015, market conditions permitting. During the fourth quarter, our Board approved a new $3 billion authorization to support share repurchases, including the completion of the 60 million share reduction. At the end of 2014, a total of $3.4 billion remained on our share repurchase authorizations. We paid shareholders $563 million in dividends in 2014 and increased our dividend by 15% last May. Over the last five years, our annual dividend per share has grown 60%. While we returned substantial amounts of cash to our shareholders in 2014, we also continued to invest in our businesses. Capital spending increased more than 50% to $561 million and research and development investments increased more than 12% to $569 million. Our strategy of focusing on performance; portfolio and cash is working. We’ve created a portfolio centered on our key capability of names of unmanned and manned aircraft C4ISR; cyber; logistics and modernization. Our strategy has resulted in a high performing portfolio that’s well aligned with the current and emerging technologies and capabilities that we believe will be of highest priority for future global security. Simultaneously, we have improved our affordability through both cost reductions and innovation. Both efforts are necessary to truly achieve affordability for our customers. As we look ahead, congress passed a fiscal year 2015 appropriations bill that provides a degree of certainty for our customers but it also represents the seventh year of continuously declining budgets. In addition the debt ceiling limits still needs to be addressed and a potential sequestration could be triggered for fiscal year 2016. All of these factors will continue to influence our customer spending decisions during the coming months. Turning to guidance for 2015, we expect sales of $23.4 billion to $23.8 billion with earnings per share of $9.20 to $9.50; cash from operations of $2.4 billion to $2.7 billion and free cash flow of $1.7 billion to $2 billion. Jim will provide more detail on our guidance, but we expect continued pressure on our shorter cycle businesses, which will be partially offset by growing international sales. In conclusion, our 2014 results represent another year of strong performance. In 2015, our priorities are unchanged: Drive strong, sustainable performance; generate cash; and effectively deploy that cash; and continue to optimize our portfolio to ensure our alignment with global security priorities. We have a solid track record that demonstrates that we can do this successfully. And we look forward to continued long-term sustainable value creation. So now, I’ll turn the call over to Jim for a more detailed discussion of results and guidance. Jim?
Jim Palmer: Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. I want to add my congratulations to our team on their continued outstanding performance. And Wes, I want to personally thank you for your kind comments, I truly appreciate them. I certainly enjoyed being part of a company of outstanding people who are fulfilling missions of the highest importance to our nation and our allies. I feel proud to have been part of a team that’s accomplished so much. Today I’ll briefly just review 2014 results and then discuss 2015 guidance. Beginning with performance, 2014 segment operating margin rate improved 40 basis points to 12.9%. About 20 basis points of that improvement resulted from the $75 million in settlements at Aerospace Systems that we recorded in the third quarter. Excluding the settlements from both consolidated sales and segment operating income, our 2014 segment operating margin rate would have been 12.7% versus 12.5% in 2013. The year-over-year improvement reflects better operating margin performance at three of our four sectors. Aerospace Systems was the largest contributor to this year’s margin rate improvement where part of the improvement being the previously mentioned settlements. So, in adjusting AS sales and operating income for the settlements would give them a 12.5% operating margin rate for the year, still a 40 basis-point increase over 2013 due to improved performance. Information Systems and Technical Services continued the strong performance with margin rate improvements of 20 basis points and 10 basis points respectively. Electronic Systems, while down versus 2013, posted a very strong 16.5% margin rate. Total operating margin rate for 2014 13.3%, 60 basis points higher than last year, principally due to more favorable net FAS/CAS pension adjustment and higher segment operating income. These positive trends were partially offset by $15 million increase to a more normal level of unallocated corporate expenses. You’ll recall that our 2013 unallocated expenses were unusually low due to lower provisions for disallowed costs and litigation matters as well as a favorable settlement of overhead claims. On a pension adjusted basis, our operating margin rate increased to 12.2%, a new record for the company. You also saw on our press release that in the fourth quarter, we recognized a full year 2014 R&D tax credit at $38 million through the extension of tax benefits at year-end. Turning to cash, 2014 was another good year, both in absolute dollars and on a per share basis. Free cash flow totaled $2 billion and we returned more than $3.2 billion by $15 per share to our shareholders. In 2014, total shareholder return was 31.4%. So, it was another very good year, both in terms of performance and value creation for our shareholders. Now, let’s spend a couple of minutes and discuss our 2015 guidance, beginning with sector sales and OM rates. For 2015, we expect AS sales to range between $9.8 billion and $10 billion with a margin rate in high 11% range. Sales guidance reflects more volume for manned aircraft and space programs, partially offset by growth in unmanned programs. And manned aircraft, we expect more volume for the F/A-18 and Joint STARS which will be partially offset by ramp ups in E-2D and F-35. In space, we expect more volume for the Advanced EHF and for The James Webb Space Telescope. And then turning to unmanned, we expect double-digit growth in our high-altitude long endurance business which includes programs such Global Hawk Triton and NATO AGS to partially offset declines in other businesses. For Electronic Systems, we expect 2015 revenue of $6.7 billion to $6.9 billion and our sales guidance includes some lingering impacts from force reductions but partially offset by expected growth in international sales. We expect EXPENSES operating margin rate in the low to 15% range although lower than 2014, still very healthy and indicator of continued strong performance. We expect Information Systems sales in the range of $5.9 billion to $6.1 billion, a low to mid single digit compared to a 6% decline, so thus a moderation in the rate of decline. The sales decrease primarily reflects reduced volume in command and control; ISR and civil programs due to program completions and transitions as well as continued force reductions. Higher volume on F-35 and growth within our international portfolio should partially offset those impacts. Our outlook for IS continues to reflect the pressure on the shorter cycle businesses due to lower funding levels and budget uncertainty. As Wes said, the budget process is little bit better at this point, but our customers are still facing the potential sequestration in fiscal 2016. And we expect that situation will continue to influence customer behavior in our shorter cycle businesses, particularly as we approach the end of the government’s fiscal year. Despite the top-line pressures and continued investment in our international business opportunities, we expect IS to maintain a mid to high 9% operating margin rate in 2015. Moving to Technical Services, our expectation for 2015 sales is $2.7 billion to $2.8 billion with a margin rate of approximately 9%. The sales outlook TS reflects lower revenue ICBM, Hunter and Combined Tactical Training Range programs with growth at international programs expected offset some of the decline in these other programs. So, on a consolidated basis, we expect 2015 segment operating margin rate will be about 12% and we expect our total operating margin rate will be in the mid 12% range. Turning to Pension, on the third quarter call, I mentioned and I discussed the potential impact of variable such as the updated mortality assumptions and lower discount rates on our expectations for the 2015 FAS/CAS pension adjustment. And at that time, we estimated that our 2015 net FAS/CAS adjustment would be income of about $150 million. Now that we have filed data, we are increasing our 2015 net FAS/CAS pension adjustment to income of $290 million or an increase of $20 million from 2014 levels. This reflects 2015 CAS expense of approximately $675 million and FAS expense of $385 million. Our 2015 estimates reflect adoption of updated mortality assumptions, actual 2014 planned asset returns of about 9.75% net of expenses and 8% long-term rate of return on planned assets and a discount rate of 4.12% versus last year’s discount rate of 4.99% at the end of the year. When we file our 10-K, you’ll see that our projected pension obligations have increased by approximately $4.5 billion to $30.5 billion with the increase being largely result of the decrease in the year-end discount rate and then to somewhat lesser extent to the updated mortality assumptions. On a longer term basis for 2016 and 2017, we currently expect CAS expense of approximately $765 million and $840 million respectively, while FAS expense is currently expected to be $315 million and $240 million for 2016 and 2017 respectively. And for your modeling purposes, a 25 basis-point change in the discount rate results in a net $65 million change in 2016 FAS expense, likewise 100 basis-point change in plan asset returns versus the assumed rate of 8% results in a $50 million change in 2016 FAS expense. In the aggregate, on a GAAP basis the funding status of our plans was 82% at the end of ‘14, reflecting the impact of the lower discount rate and the updated mortality assumptions. Our qualified plans are 86% funded and our required contributions remain minimal, about $75 million in 2015 and for the next several years. I would note however that we are continually evaluating whether to make additional voluntary plan contributions based on their potential economic benefits. Turning to taxes, we expect the tax rate of approximately 32.5% of 2015, which does not include an R&D tax credit extension or potential benefit of possible resolution of IRS exam issues for the tax years 2007 through 2011. Our 2015 earnings per share guidance of $9.20 to $9.50, contemplates 8% reduction in weighted average shares outstanding to approximately 195 million shares. We expect cash from operations before discretionary pension contributions will range between $2.4 billion to $2.7 billion and free cash flow before discretionary pension contributions is expected to range between $1.7 billion and $2 billion. Our free cash flow guidance anticipates capital spending of about $700 million in 2015. We spent slightly less in 2014 than our planned capital expenditures of $600 million. And frankly I would expect that that under-spent amount will be made up in 2015 along with some other increases. Regarding cash trends in ‘15 versus ‘14, we do expect an increase of about $300 million in cash -- in CAS collections in 2015. On an after tax basis, that is about $200 million of increased cash flow. However, there are two other major factors that will reduce 2015 cash flow when compared to 2014. First, 2014 had three unusual items that at this point are not expected to repeat in 2015. They are the $75 million of settlements; the IRS partial resolution of tax years 2007 through 2009 and the R&D tax credit extension. Together those three items represent $125 million reduction in this year’s 2015 after tax cash flow when compared to 2014. Finally, in 2015, our biweekly payroll cycle results in 27 pay periods rather than a normal 26, another $125 million reduction in cash flow versus 2014. Our guidance reflects another year of strong operating performance and strong cash generation supportive of continued investment in our business and distribution of cash to our shareholders. So, that concludes my comments on 2014 performance and 2015 guidance. But before we begin Q&A, I’d like to spend a few minutes and introduce Ken Bedingfield, our CFO Elect, and add just a few thoughts. Obviously, Ken and I have worked closely together in his role as Corporate Controller and as the Operating CFO at Aerospace Systems. After seeing him in those roles, I’m confident that Ken has the skills and qualifications to lead our financial organization. He’s earned the trust and confidence of our management team and I’m pleased to be succeeded by such an outstanding individual. So Ken, over to you.
Ken Bedingfield: Thanks Jim and good afternoon everybody. I’d like to add my thanks to the team for another job well done. Over the last several months, I’ve had the opportunity to meet a number of you and I look forward to meeting more in the coming months. Wes, Jim and I share similar philosophies, particularly on sustainable performance and cash deployment. We have worked closely together over the last several years. I’m looking forward to assuming the CFO role after we file our 10-K, which should be next week. I’d like to thank Jim for his leadership and guidance. He’s been a great mentor. And I’m confident that our continued transition over the next few months will be seamless. I look forward to speaking with you again on our first quarter conference call. Let me turn it back to Steve.
Steve Movius: Thanks Ken. As we open up the call for Q&A, I would ask each participant limit themselves to a single question. With that Katelyn, we are ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Cai with Cowen & Company.
Cai von Rumohr: Yes. Thank you very much. And Jim, congratulations on a job well done.
Jim Palmer: Thank you, Kai.
Cai von Rumohr: Wes, you mentioned your R&D up 12% last year, where do you see it going in 2015? And if you could give us a little bit of color in terms of by divisions, where you’re spending it and what the net impact on your earnings might be? Thanks.
Wes Bush: Thanks Cai, it’s really important question about how we are thinking about R&D. We don’t guide with specific numbers for each year on what they are, we do repeat them at the end of each year. But I will just say that as we think about our role in the broader global security community, our role is to bring technology for you and bring the types of solutions that are based on technological superiority that enables our nation and those of our allies to get the jobs done. So, technology has always been a core part of what we do. And through this downturn cycle, we’ve held our R&D as a percentage of sales up through the cycle. And I see us continuing to emphasize this and grow it over time. And this goes across all of our businesses by the way. As you might imagine, some of our businesses are little bit more technologically intensive than others and so it’s not exactly the same percentage in each year. Every single one of them has a strong technological underpinning. And that span of technology encompasses not only the things that we’re working on in terms of near term developments to bring in the products but also the very early stage technologies. Things that aren’t going to pay off for our company or for our customers for many, many years, we see that as just an absolutely integral and critical part of our R&D strategy. Not every one of those investments turns out that we can turn it into something but we believe that’s a key part of being in the technology space. We’re going to try some things that don’t always work out and some of them work out astoundingly well. So, we are going to continue that on our path forward. I’ve mentioned several times in past calls, about half of our population, about half of our 65,000 folks are degreed scientists, engineers, mathematicians, technologists of some kind. So, there is just an amazing amount of creative capacity in this organization. And our ability to get good returns on our technology investments is really because of the hard work and dedication and creativity of that great team.
Operator: Your next question comes from Joe with J.P. Morgan.
Joe Nadol: Thanks. Good afternoon. Congrats to Jim and Ken, both.
Jim Palmer: Thanks.
Joe Nadol: My question is just as we look at the margin guidance for Aerospace and for Electronic Systems and you guys have done a pretty good job over the last several years of guiding a lower and beating. I was just trying to get some context here on whether -- how much upside there might be if you’re able to maintain your -- to what degree you might be able to maintain the margins you’ve been running at the last couple of years. So, maybe the question would be how much of the margin degradation is due to mix and how much of the expected margin degradation is due to lower adjustments?
Jim Palmer: Joe, this is Jim. We don’t really plan for adjustments; we plan for marginal rates associated with each of our businesses looking at backlogs and margins inherent in the backlog as well as where we think the business will perform. When I think about our Electronic Systems business, 16.5% margin this year and guidance for next year still is very good performance. Relative to the industry peers, frankly we’ve had in Electronic Systems, a group of mature production programs that are nearing completion, being replaced by younger development programs and/or younger production programs. So, we’re going through a little bit of a shift from some mature programs to some less mature programs. But that’s kind of the normal cycle. At Aerospace, again, the $75 million benefit that’s in margins in Aerospace this year will not at least the -- reason why it’s going to be here next year. So, that’s a big part of a change in margins in Aerospace. But again, high 11% margin is really good performance. We had a little change over the last couple of years in our fixed price business mix change but it’s not been that significant, probably up a couple of percentage points on a year-over-year basis. So, we continue to have significant development activities in each of our businesses, which actually is life bud of our future.
Wes Bush: Yes. And Jim, I’ll just add to that because Joe had good comment about mix. And I think that’s a really important perspective, just to reiterate something that we’ve all said a number of times over the past couple of years. As we go forward, we do expect there to be a number of good development activities. And I’m okay with our margin rates coming down a little bit based on our successful cascade of new development activities. I’m not okay with margin rates coming down. If there are performance issues, we went through an era as a company where we had a series of performance issues and worked hard and get passed that. So, our focus is go out, get those really good development opportunities that should create great value for our shareholders over time. If we need to have a little bit lower margin rate because of that mix shift over time, that’s fine but we’re going to keep performing. And that’s really going to be the focus across the enterprise is whatever go at and capture, we’re going to execute well.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Howard with Jefferies.
Howard Rubel: Thank you very much. Mr. Palmer, you have set a high bar.
Wes Bush: He has.
Howard Rubel: Now I’d add, it’s actually been a pleasure to work with you.
Jim Palmer: Thank you Howard, I really appreciate the comment.
Howard Rubel: You spent $700 million in capital which is large relative to normal standards. Could you elaborate a little bit on where it’s going and how fast you think you might be able to see some payoff from it, Wes?
Wes Bush: Yes, hi. And I’ll ask Jim to give a little bit more of a color on it. But it goes actually back, Howard, to what we were just talking about as we have -- look at our future. We have made some decisions to structurally get aligned a bit better. And we announced a little bit of time ago, our focus on moving into centers of excellence. That requires a bit of capital to actually get those stood up and operating the right way. And as we get those facilities in place, we look forward to having a number of all of you from the investment community come and take a look at these new centers. So, that’s a part of it. Other parts of it go fundamentally to supporting the program opportunities that we’ve captured or that we see on the horizon. We’re investing in the company because we see a good opportunity for return here. Jim, is there any more detail on that?
Jim Palmer: Just echo your comments, centers of excellence and program opportunities are really the drivers of capital investment. And frankly, last year we said that capital expenditures were going to be high for a few years and we basically implemented what we said we were going to do.
Wes Bush: Yes. And I’ll just point out as well that when we talk about centers of excellence sometimes that sounds like company consolidation. And yes, perhaps that 50,000 foot level, that’s where it is. But ultimately, it’s a key part of our strategy to drive both affordability and innovation in the organization. We’re finding that as we do a better job of integrating some of the activities that have been geographically separated that we’re getting a lot of very positive energy that is going not only into the programs but are being executed but also the development of new opportunities. So, that’s a big part on the innovation side. And of course on the affordability side, consolidating our footprint has been a process that we’ve been underway now for several years. And that’s already paying off of course. And we expect to see good returns on that as we go forward. So, overall, my point is that capital investment has a lot of different strands that run through affordability, innovation and supporting our programs across the board. And we’re delighted to be able to have those kind of opportunities to invest where we see those returns.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug with Sanford Bernstein.
Doug Harned: Thank you.
Jim Palmer: Hey Doug.
Doug Harned: Hey Jim. And really it’s been just great working with you. So, I wanted to wish you all the best going forward. It’s been great, great several years here.
Jim Palmer: That’s a mutual feeling that’s shared.
Doug Harned: Yes. Anyway, so good luck.
Jim Palmer: Thanks. I need it.
Doug Harned: I don’t think so. But I’ve got a question here nonetheless on the short cycle businesses, Information Systems and Tech Services. When you look at the backlogs, you’re looking at 10% decline in Information Systems backlog and even more in Tech Services, yet your guidance for revenues is down a little in each. And I’m assuming if that KC-10 and ICBM supported Tech Services. But it was surprising to me to see your revenue expectations hold up reasonably well considering what appears to be a lot of pressure on backlog here.
Jim Palmer: Doug, you hit on a couple of the items. Clearly right after the end of the year, we booked $900 million award in Technical Services piece of the business. And those touch and go whether that would have gone be in the end of the year, the first of 2015. And basically we didn’t rush the deal, we made sure that we got a deal that made sense and so that’s locked over in 2015, so be it. When we look at the shorter cycle business, Information Systems, it’s interesting that only about little over half of the revenues actually come out of funded backlog for the year. That is a shorter cycle business, a big part of the business moves from unfunded backlog to funded backlog as we go through the year. Said differently, the customer tends to fund this in a number of months increments rather than a full annual year basis. And so, we tend to see that kind of cycle move through there as well as just being a shorter cycle business. So, new awards have more of immediate impact on revenues in the current year. So, its’ a combination of all those kinds of things and frankly, some expectations for international opportunities as well that went into our revenue guidance for both of those businesses.
Wes Bush: And I would just add a little bit. The science of backlog conversion to revenues in the following year is an interesting area of study. We all know that in our long cycle business, it often takes a while before that backlog converts to sales and that’s what we mean by long cycle. And obviously in short cycle, we know that there is a lot more volatility in that conversion. And I think if you think about these vectors backlog and revenue, it’s probably easy to conclude that the direction of the vectors is more often aligned than it is to conclude that the magnitude of the vectors is aligned and correlated. And if you look back over just the last few years, in IS we have seen some years of notable declines in backlog where the revenues in the following year were directionally the same, it was down but the magnitude was a lot different. And that goes back to what Jim was saying, it’s due to the nature of these short cycle businesses that sometimes we’re seeing more revenue from the awards that are captured in the year of performance. So, when we do our look forward and give our guidance, we really do look at the whole pipeline, it’s not just the back -- we just look at the backlog, it is a perspective that encompasses what we see in front of us in the current year and how we see that translating into revenue. So, of course our 2015 guidance does contemplate what that current backlog position looks like but I would say more importantly, it contemplates what we see from a pipeline perspective and a position perspective.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Carter with Barclays.
Carter Copeland: Good morning guys or I guess I should say good afternoon. And again, let me add to the congratulations Jim on all of your success.
Jim Palmer: Thank you, Carter.
Carter Copeland: I want to go back to one of the earlier questions on research and development. And at least from a high level or just directional, I know you don’t disclose the number, Wes, as you said but several of your peers so far this quarter and this year have talked about greater amounts of internal research and development impacting their margin outlooks. And I wondered if you might speak at least directionally, is that something that’s influencing your P&L this year or potentially in future years or should we see a relatively stable amount of that investment?
Wes Bush: It’s not a big factor this year. Clearly, it varies from year to year depending on the mix on fixed price cost plus and you can play the math through on that. But I don’t see it as a differentially big issue this year relative to prior years. I don’t want to put a stake in the sand on future years. Obviously we need a strategic flexibility to decide how we manage that based on the environment. But as I said earlier, it’s going to continue to be really, really importantly to us. It’s the life bud of our enterprise. So, we’re going to make sure we are managing it the right way. Jim, do you have any other to add to that?
Jim Palmer: I’d just add Wes that -- Carter, we manage all cost and that’s just one element of cost. And so, to the extent that we choose spend more money on R&D or IRAD, essentially we’re trying to find other ways that we can reduce other cost so that we keep our total cost structure in line with what was anticipated when we bid these contracts. So, it’s always a little bit of push and pull, between how much for this and how much for that. But then choosing to spend more on IRAD or research and development, we’re cautiously working to reduce other cost to give us the flexibility to absorb that increased IRAD investment within our total cost structure.
Wes Bush: Yes. And that’s actually important point. If you look at how we’ve done that over the last few years, if you think about it, and Jim and Steve will correct me if I get these numbers slightly wrong. But over the last five years, our top-line is down around 13% but our headcount is down around 20% - 21%; our footprint is down around 10%.
Jim Palmer: Correct.
Wes Bush: So, we’ve gone after a whole set of cost structure issues that have enabled us to maintain our R&D investment. And as we said earlier, we’ve done it because that’s what we do. That’s the essence of our enterprise to be able to bring technologically based solutions to our customer community. And I certainly anticipate we’ll be doing that on a go forward basis.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Noah with Goldman Sachs.
Noah Poponak: Hi. Good afternoon.
Wes Bush: Hi Noah. How are you?
Noah Poponak: Good, good. How are you, Wes?
Wes Bush: Good.
Noah Poponak: Jim, congratulations. That was a fairly impressive run you put up there. It sounded like you might have been tearing up a little on your prepared remarks actually.
Jim Palmer: Actually I have a pretty bad cough and I had cough drop in my mouth and…
Noah Poponak: It’s good that you had a planned excuse for windup.
Wes Bush: I was tearing [ph] up Noah.
Noah Poponak: So, a little bit bigger picture question. If I look at the past many years, call it 20 years of the company, it’s grown double digits organically very few times. And it’s a mature steady business, so that makes sense. Looking forward, if you’re able to secure some of the larger wins you’re going after, and if the defense budget can actually grow a little for you, should it be in our collective scenario analysis that we could actually move into one of those periods where between now and the end of the decade you can actually put up one or two years where you actually grow double digits? And I’m not asking you to commit to that obviously but with that kind of the order of magnitude type of math we’re dealing with, given the size of some of the stuff you’re going after?
Wes Bush: Noah, I would say that there are some factors that drive that probably well beyond our control. Clearly the global security environment is the most prominent driver of how that works out. And we all know we’re dealing with a road us today that has so much volatility in that regard that any one thing in that basket of volatility could push our nation and our allies into a very different place of security spending. So, trying to predict that and get out ahead of that is difficult but we want to make sure we’re always ready in the event that we’re called upon to respond to that sort of outcome that we’re ready to do it. So, that’s one aspect of it. The other aspect of it, I just want to be very clear about because I know many folks listen to these call, including some of our employees. And we are not an enterprise that’s being driven by visions of the top-line. We drive our enterprise based on value creation. And if we put our head stood and said [indiscernible] we’re going to figure out one way or another to get a double-digit and top-line, yes, we could probably go figure how to do it and then perhaps regret it a few years later. We’re going to continue to drive this enterprise on value creation. So, even in a case where there maybe extraordinary opportunities in front of us, we’re not going to get mesmerized top-line mathematics. We’re going to continue to make case by case decisions on what makes sense and how we create value. So, those two things I think are important to have in your mind if you think about our company. We’re going to be value driven and we’re going to be ready to support our customer community, no matter what they face.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert with RBC Capital.
Robert Stallard: Thanks so much. Good morning.
Wes Bush: Good morning, Robert.
Robert Stallard: Good afternoon. Jim, I’d add my congratulations and thanks for your help with pension over the years.
Wes Bush: I’ve often said, Jim is able to provide a PhD thesis on pensionology.
Robert Stallard: I’ll avoid that topic this time. You mentioned that if everything goes to plan that your share buyback plan should be concluded this year. And I was wondering what we could expect after that because you made several comments this morning and this afternoon about more internal investment, so really that alters your capital deployment program for the longer term.
Wes Bush: Well, I would say Rob, we’re first and foremost focused on achieving the objective that we laid out for ourselves when we announced our plan in the middle of 2013, the retirement of 60 million shares. So, we’ve got a full year ahead of us. And that’s really our focus to make sure that we do that in a way that’s thoughtful and in a way that creates good value for our shareholders. Beyond that, I really can’t say anything that would provide too much commitment but what I can say is if you look back at what we’ve been doing for a long time, we’re fairly predictable crowd. We obviously prefer to put every dollar we can inside the business to generate long-term returns. And you’re seeing us do a bit of an increase in that regard because we see opportunities against which we can match those investments. But in aggregate, we’ve been a very healthy returner of cash to shareholders. And we think that strategy has worked well for us. We of course always continue to evaluate that to make sure that we’re making the best decisions on behalf of our shareholders for how we deploy that cash. But as I said earlier, you can tell how we think by looking at our track record.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Myles with Deutsche Bank.
Myles Walton: Good afternoon. And Jim, Congratulations. I hope you could take more time often the CFO your place when you showed up back in 2007.
Wes Bush: He was certainly a better CFO than the one he replaced in 2007.
Myles Walton: The question I had was on international sales and obviously great growth you’re having. And then just to turn the question around the domestic sales slide to 4% or 5% is really an opportunity once that bottoms out. Do we have at this point enough kind of ground truth to say ‘15 likes the bottom for your domestic sales?
Wes Bush: Myles, I hate to try and call the bottom of a trough and the analogy I keep giving is it’s hard to tell if the trough is going to be V shaped or if one of these troughs has a long flat center to it. And if you just look at the math and I’m sure everybody’s done the math, the math of the sequester budget actually on a pure dollar number basis looks a little better than where we are in ‘15. So, you could say actually even if had sequester, it might be little better. But I would caution folks not to be too excited about that. If we have the sequester, what we really have is a horrible mechanism that goes with the sequester that has this mindless approach to cutting everything equally. So, how that lands in terms of individual companies, what impact that would have on our customer community just even to thinking of the customer community and how they will go about getting things under contract and making decisions. I think the sequester if not fixed is a disaster. So, I’m very focused as I know our customer community is. And quite honestly, I know many thoughtful members in congress are as well focused on being clear that this sequester is something that has to get fixed. So, I’m personally a little bit concerned about this image that somehow just because the number looks a little better in a sequester budget next year that means this year is the trough. If we don’t get this thing fixed, it could be ugly. And we got to get it fixed. Now, as I said on our last earnings call I’m seeing a lot of more sand at the end of discussing that is underway up on the hill around these issues. And I really applaud what the department is doing in terms of providing clarity to both the hill and the American people about the necessity of getting this thing fixed. But it’s not fixed yet, and until it is, I think we all need to be a little bit careful in terms of how we think about this.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert with Crédit Suisse.
Robert Spingarn: Good afternoon.
Wes Bush: Hey, Rob.
Robert Spingarn: Congrats Jim and Ken. I’ll add and Jim, I knew that was a cough drop, so you had more than you can. Wes, what you just said; want a quick question on that and then a follow up. But with regard to sequester and the fact that we’ve been living with it for a while and the budget has essentially -- it’s quiet if you will and even if we keep the budget caps, we’re kind of flattish to slight up from here. So, is it the behavioral side that you’re most concerned about because I wouldn’t expect to see sales continue to decline? And then I have a follow-up on Aerospace.
Wes Bush: Well, why don’t throw in follow-up as well; we can keep both of them for you.
Robert Spingarn: Okay. So on Aerospace, sort of the opposite of Noah’s question which is we know that you’re going after some very important premier programs here and they’re significant. And I think there is a general feeling that they’re additive to the aerospace business. And I apologize for asking another long-term top-line question but I do think it’s important. Could you talk about whether or not that assumption on additive is fair given your core aerospace business and how that trends over, let’s the next four or five years?
Wes Bush: Sure, okay. Well, let me take on these one at a time, first on the sequester. The point I think is really important to understand is the sequester mechanism that’s embedded in the law requires that the budget cuts that come with it are across the board and apply on a percentage the same to each of these line items, if you will. And that removes the flexibility of the department to manage the core structure, to manage its operations, to manage all of the things that has to mange in a rational way. No reasonable person managing a budget having to take money out of the budget would say we cut everything the same. That’s a disabling approach to managing things. And as a result of that the department would be put into disarray because the mission hasn’t changed. No one has said gee, we’re going to cut everything the same but let’s cut down our focus on ISIS, by the same we cut down our focus on Russia, by the same we cut down our focus on emerging threats or the same we cut down our focus on cyber security. You have to make sure that you’re managing how we deploy our capability to address the threat. [ph] So, it’s this mechanism that cuts equally across all programs, projects and activities is absolutely nonsense and that will impact behavior. If you were the recipient of that type of force guidance; it’s more than guidance, it’s the law, if you were the recipient of that requirement that you manage things in that manner, yes, it would create some behaviors that you otherwise would not exhibit because you’re trying to manage to something that doesn’t make any sense. So, as I said earlier, we’ve got to get it fixed for the sake of the nation and clearly for the sake of not only the Defense Department, I would also say for the sake of all the other components of the discretionary budget that need to be operating in a rational manner, we need to get back to whatever the number is; we need to get back to a normal appropriations methodology that enables management of our government programs of our government operations. So that’s -- I’ll get off myself boxed but that’s my worry that getting this fixed is not done yet. With respect to Aerospace, the set of opportunities that we see before us in aggregate, yes, would represent an additive outcome to the magnitude of what we do in aerospace. And there are many of those opportunities, both domestic and international that we’re addressing in our Aerospace business. I mentioned in my prepared remarks at the beginning the success that we’re beginning to see around the globe with our unmanned systems, the Global Hawk contract with Korea; the type selection of Global Hawk by Japan; the strong interest in Triton that we’re seeing in several countries now. Those are very exciting opportunities in front of us. Jim mentioned E-2D as well, the type selection of E-2D by Japan and the opportunities, the other opportunities we see internationally for E-2D. So, the international side of this is exciting in aerospace. And then domestically, there are variety of programs that are on the horizon here that too would be additive. And yes, there are some things coming down F-18 is coming down a bit and there is inherent ups and downs in different parts of the AS business. But when I add those opportunities that we see in front of us to the things we already have that are growing like F-35, I see some hope for the next few years and nice opportunity for growing Aerospace which by the way I see for some of our other businesses too.
Steve Movius: Katelyn, we’ve got time for one more.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason with Citi.
Jason Gursky: Hey, good afternoon. Jim, congrats and best of luck. I just had a quick question on the F-35. I was hoping you could, either Wes or Jim, kind of the tail end of a year here updated so on the F-35 program. What I’m looking for is what is your revenue exposure on the program today, either as a percentage of total ASP or average selling price of that aircraft or however it is that you give it in dollar terms? And then talk a little bit about the split amongst all of your business, how much of it goes into Aerospace, Electronic Systems other areas within the company. And then just kind of lastly whether the margins that you’re recognizing on F-35 program earning to those segments is above or below segment operating margins and whether that margin will grow to be in line segment operating margin over time? Just kind of holistic update on the F-35 would be great.
Jim Palmer: Sure. F-35 is one of our largest programs across the company in the aggregate; it’s roughly about 5% of sales. The mix is heavier towards AS space maybe 70% of the total; Electronic Systems a little bit -- the 30% is roughly evenly split between ES and IS, but maybe a little bit heavier at ES. Probably up about a $150 million in revenue on a total company basis this year, ‘15 versus ‘14. Margin rate is probably little bit less than each of the sectors’ overall margin rate, younger program but making progress, it’s how we look at it. And over a long period of time, should perform like a mature production program.
Steve Movius: Great. Well, thank you. This concludes the Q&A portion of the call. And at this point in time, I’d like to turn it over to Wes for final comments.
Wes Bush: Well, obviously I’ll stop with the brief summary of what I said at the start of the call. 2014 was another year of solid performance by the Northrop Grumman team. And we remain focused on our strategy that is creating long-term value for our shareholders, our customers and our employees. Thanks everyone for joining us today and thanks for your continuing interest in our company.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Wes Bush: All right. Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Our teams focus on execution continues to deliver strong performance as demonstrated by this quarter’s earnings, cash flows and backlog expansion. Earnings per share increased 6% to $2.26. In addition to strong operating performance, we have two items that affected results in the quarter. Third quarter EPS was reduced by $0.30 to reflect passage of the Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2014. We also realized $75 million for settlements of certain legal claims, which increased EPS by $0.23. Jim will provide more detail on these items later in the call, but together they reduced third quarter earnings per share by $0.07. Based on our year-to-date results, we’re increasing our EPS guidance to a range of $9.40 to $9.50 from our prior range of $9.15 to $9.35. This is an increase of approximately 13% over 2013 EPS. We’re also increasing our 2014 sales guidance to approximately 23.8 billion, the high end of our prior range. Growth in our international business continues to partially offset the impact of domestic budget pressures. Cash from operations totaled 933 million for the quarter. Free cash flow totaled 824 million and we ended the quarter with a cash balance of approximately $3.4 billion. Based on these results, we remain comfortable with our free cash flow guidance of 1.7 billion to 2 billion for the year. As you’re aware, the fourth quarter is typically our strongest in terms of cash collections. We’re particularly pleased to report that total backlog increased 8% from 35.6 billion at the end of the second quarter to 38.5 billion. Book-to-bill for the quarter was 150% and book-to-bill for the nine months was 107%. Third quarter bookings included a $3.6 billion contract for 25 E-2D Advanced Hawkeye aircraft, which was the primary driver of the strong book-to-bill. We also received a $354 million award for three additional Global Hawks and a $422 million contract for the sensor payloads for the fifth and sixth SBIR satellites. We were recently awarded another 300 million for Global Hawk contractor logistic support. Third quarter book-to-bill was 200% at Aerospace Systems reflecting the large E-2D award, 122% at Electronic Systems, 109% at Information Systems and 87% at Technical Services. While we are encouraged by this quarter’s overall trend, we’ve recognized that our customers are now working under a continuing resolution for fiscal year 2015 and sequestration can be triggered again in fiscal year 2016. Turning to cash deployment, we repurchased 6 million shares for 753 million bringing year-to-date repurchases to nearly 17 million at a cost of $2.1 billion. Over the last six quarters, we bought back 37.7 million share or more than 60% toward our goal of returning 60 million shares by the end of 2015 market conditions permitting. We take a long-term view of the company’s value and continue to view share repurchases in combination with competitive dividend as an effective way to deploy our cash and to create shareholder value. We continue to have a robust set of domestic and international opportunities across the company for our unmanned and manned platforms and in our C4ISR, cyber and logistics and modernization domains. Global Hawk and Triton have attractive strong international interest. We’re currently negotiating a Global Hawk sale to Korea and the technical progress we’ve made on Triton including our second plane’s successful completion of its first flight bodes well for future international sales for that system. In the international arena, we expect significant growth in the F-35 program and the E-2D also has potential for international sales. There are important domestic opportunities as well such as long-range strike and CIRCM. When Congress returns after the elections and fiscal year 2015 budget negotiations resume, we believe our programs will continue to be well supported. In light of growing global security challenges, it’s especially critical that our nation focuses on maintaining our technological leadership and our military superiority. We would encourage Congress to find a way to avoid sequestration in fiscal year 2016. Our Pentagon leadership must be able to strategically deploy its increasingly limited resources without the limitations of sequestration. Now I’ll turn the call over to Jim for a more detailed discussion of our results and our guidance. Jim?
James F. Palmer: Thanks, Wes, and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. My comments will cover this quarter’s results and I’ll also discuss our updated 2014 guidance and provide a first look at 2015 pension items. But first I want to begin by expressing my appreciation to our team for their continued focus on execution. As Wes mentioned, our third quarter EPS of $2.26 included two items that collectively reduced EPS by $0.07. Before these items, third quarter EPS would have been $2.33 or 9% higher than last year’s third quarter due to strong operating performance and share repurchases. But first on those two items was the passage of the Highway and Transportation Funding Act in August. The Act extended higher discount rates instituted when the prior bill known as MAP-21 was originally passed in 2012. The higher rates were retroactive to January 1 of this year and are a significant factor in determining CAS amortization pension expense. The MAP-21 extension impacted third quarter results in two ways. First, we recognized $132 million year-to-date reduction in expected 2014 CAS pension expense, which drove an $81 million decline in third quarter net FAS/CAS pension adjustment. This is a cumulative amount representing nine months reduction in expected CAS expense. The large change is driven by the improvement in the funding status of our pension plans on a CAS basis due to the higher discount rates. Our largest plan essentially became fully funded with no 2014 CAS costs as a result of MAP-21 extension. We don’t expect the situation will repeat itself in 2015 due to the expected increase in mortality assumptions. Secondly, the $132 million reduced CAS pension expenses charge to our contracts thereby increasing our segment operating margin rate by a rate of segment operating margin dollars by $37 million. Second operating margin didn’t increase by the full 132 million reduction since we share cross savings with our customers on the majority of our contracts. So only a portion of the savings flowed through to segment operating margin. The net impact of these two items related to the MAP-21 extension was a $95 million pre-tax reduction to operating income and a $62 million decrease in net earnings or $0.30 per share reduction in EPS. Also, during the quarter, we realized $75 million for settlements of certain legal claims related to the use of company’s intellectual property and a terminated program. This benefited Aerospace Systems sales and operating income and improved third quarter earnings by $0.23 per share. So turning to the sector results, Aerospace Systems third quarter sales increased by 2%. The increase was driven by the $75 million realized for the settlements. Excluding the settlements, AS sales were slightly lower for the quarter and reflect lower volume for manned military aircraft and comparable sales for our unmanned and space programs. Manned military aircraft had lower volumes for programs like B-2, Joint STARS and the F/A-18. Those declines were partially offset by higher sales for the E-2D program. AS operating income increased 22% and operating margin rate rose to 15.8% principally due to the settlements. AS also benefited from increased margins and lower CAS costs. And excluding those two items, AS margin rate would have been 12.7% for the quarter. We now expect AS 2014 sales will reach approximately $10 billion essentially matching last year’s top line with an operating margin rate in the low 13% range versus our prior guidance of 12%. Electronic Systems third quarter sales declined 2% due to lower deliveries for combat avionics and infrared countermeasures programs partially offset by increases in space, marine and undersea programs. ES operating income was comparable to the prior year and they experienced a 40 basis point improvement to operating margin rate to get to 15.8%. The higher margin rate includes performance improvements as well as the benefit of additional margin resulting from lower CAS costs related to the MAP-21 extension. For the year, we expect ES sales of approximately $6.9 billion and we now expect an ES operating margin rate of approximately 16% for the year. Information Systems third quarter sales declined by 7%. Lower government funding levels and in-theater troop dropdowns continue to impact sales particularly for our command and control programs. Operating income at IS declined in line with sales and IS continued very strong operating margin rate. For the year, we expect IS sales of approximately $6.2 billion at the high end of our prior guidance range, for the margin rate in the high 9% range, which is unchanged from our prior guidance. Moving to Technical Services, third quarter sales declined due to ramp-downs in the ICBM and Combined Tactical Training Range programs and was partially offset by higher international sales. For the year, we are now increasing sales guidance to approximately $2.8 billion for TS versus our prior guidance of $2.7 billion. And we’re increasing our operating margin rate guidance to the low 9% range. On a consolidated basis, our third quarter segment operating margin rate was 14%. But if I adjust sales and operating income for the settlements and the additional margin resulting from the lower CAS costs due to MAP-21 extension, our third quarter segment operating margin rate would have been 12.3%, which is consistent with the trends that we had in the first half of the year and comparable to that of last year. Based on year-to-date results and our updated CAS expectations, 2014 segment operating margin rate should be in the high 12% range and with higher segment operating income and our updated net FAS/CAS pension adjusted, our total operating margin rate should be in the low 13% range. We now expect a slightly lower tax rate of approximately 30.75%, down from our prior estimate of 31.5%. And finally I would also note that we continue to expect a 9% decline in our weighted average diluted share count for the year. Turning to cash from operations, we generated $933 million in the quarter and $1.1 billion year-to-date. Free cash flow for the third quarter was $824 million. And consistent with our historical pattern, we anticipate strong cash flow in the fourth quarter. Year-to-date capital spending increased by approximately $100 million and we continue to expect capital spending of approximately $600 million for the year. As Wes said, we are maintaining our guidance for cash from operations of $2.3 billion to $2.6 billion and for free cash flow at $1.7 billion to $2 billion, despite the negative impact of the MAP-21 extension. Before we begin Q&A, I want to update 2014 pension guidance and discuss 2015 pension and all of its elements; CAS, FAS and cash. So due to MAP-21 extension, we now expect that our 2014 CAS pension expense will be approximately $380 million versus our prior estimate of approximately $560 million or a reduction of $180 million for the year. This gives us then an updated estimate of our net FAS/CAS pension adjustment of $260 million versus our prior estimate of $440 million. Looking ahead, the extension of MAP-21 results in higher future CAS amortization discount rates, which will likely impact our CAS pension expense for a number of years. We estimate that the cumulative increase in CAS amortization discount rates will be about 100 basis points over the next couple of years. You’ll recall then in our January conference call, we expected CAS amortization would increase our CAS recoveries by $200 million to $225 million each year for 2015 and 2016. Those estimates will now be impacted by both the higher discount rates in the MAP-21 extension as well as the expected update from mortality assumptions. I’ll remind you though last quarter we said that beginning in 2015, we expect that the updated mortality assumptions will increase our FAS expense by approximately $50 million and CAS expense by approximately $40 million for every 100 basis point increase in our pension benefit liability. We currently expect an increase in our pension liability of approximately 6% pending finalization of the society of actuary study later this year. The CAS impacts from the higher discount rates and updated mortality assumptions will be largely offsetting over the next few years. But as MAP-21 extension wears away over time, the mortality impact will be the principal driver of future CAS expense. So, if I hold all other assumptions constant, we would now expect our CAS expense to be approximately 700 million in 2015 and approximately 800 million in 2016. Those estimates incorporate the higher CAS amortization discount rates, updated mortality assumptions and the estimates of the resulting funding status of the plans under CAS. These estimates compared with our prior estimates are approximately 750 million for 2015 and approximately 950 million in 2016. Now, I’m going to spend a few minutes discussing the impacts to FAS, so by updating for the expected changes in mortality assumptions as well as for discount rates, we would now expect FAS expense of approximately $550 million for 2015 and approximately $500 million for 2016 versus our prior estimates of approximately $100 million each for those years. Those amounts assume a discount rate in the 4.25% range versus the 2014 current rate of 4.99%. As I think many of you know, rates have obviously been very volatile particularly recently and that assumption on interest rates will likely change based on where we are at year end. Other than the change to mortality and year-end discount debt rate, all other assumptions such as investment returns are held constant in those estimates. I will point out that through the end of last week, we estimate that our planned investment returns were approximately 7% versus our long-term rate of return assumption of 8%. As all of you know, we will further define our future year estimates on our year-end conference call when we have actual 2014 planned investment returns as well as year-end discount rates. Just to remind everyone, a 25 basis point change in our discount rate changes 2015 FAS pension expense by a net amount of $60 million and 100 basis point change in our actual planned investment returns compared to our 8% long-term rate of return assumption changes 2015 FAS pension expense by $45 million. Lastly, looking at cash impacts, we don’t expect that the updated mortality assumptions or higher discount rates required to be used for CAS and for funding to impact our near-term funding requirements. Over the next couple of years, we continue to expect minimal required funding for our plans. So Steve, with that, I think we’re ready for Q&A.
Steve Movius: Thanks, Jim. As a courtesy, we ask each participant to limit themselves to a single one-part question, so we can hopefully get through the queue. Katelyn, we’re ready for Q&A
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada.
Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets: Thanks so much. Good afternoon.
Wes Bush: Hi, Bob.
Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets: Thanks for the pension stuff, Jim. I know you love that.
James F. Palmer: All right.
Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets: On the cash front, this might be a question [Wes] (ph), do the changes in the CAS recovery have any implication for your cash deployment plans going forward, particularly on the buyback?
Wes Bush: No, we don’t see any changes in our plans based on anything that we’re seeing in CAS at this point.
Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets: On the – sorry, continue.
James F. Palmer: I would just point out that the numbers I just gave you for CAS recoveries compared to our prior estimates are up a few $100 million over a three-year period, so not --
Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets: Yes, not a lot of impact.
James F. Palmer: Yes.
Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets: And just to follow up on the cash front, Wes, are you seeing any change out there in the M&A market given that we now have a bit of stability in the DoD base budget. Are you starting to see more interest in Defense acquisitions?
Wes Bush: I would say that there continues to be a fair amount of interest in the technology side of the space, just everyone wanting to make sure that collectively we’re thinking ahead and highly engaged on the technology end of it. But do I see a big uptick relative to kind of where we’ve been for a bit of time? Not on the near horizon do I see that. As always, we continue to be active and taking a look at things that are out there. I haven’t of late seen very much that really triggered us to be that engaged in it, but we’re going to continue to look just as we always have. We think it’s an important part of our overall strategic management process to be engaged in that aspect of development.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein.
Douglas Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.: Good morning.
Wes Bush: Hi, Doug.
James F. Palmer: Hi, Doug.
Douglas Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.: Your Electronic Systems backlog has come up a lot, I mean you’re above $10 billion there and that’s the highest that you’ve seen in quite some time. Could you talk about what’s been driving that higher backlog and does that suggest to you some growth going forward over the next few years?
James F. Palmer: Yes, Doug, you’re right. I think we had an all-time high in our Electronic Systems backlog for our number of multiyear deals that affected the backlog as well as some of our marine programs. As you know, we had a multiyear deal on E-2D aerospace. Electronic Systems also has some activities on that program. So all of those are part of that impact to the backlog.
Wes Bush: Doug, it’s Wes. I’d just add that across the board, the business continues to do well with Electronics. We have such a wider array of capability there that continues to be in demand both domestically and internationally. You may recall that Electronic Systems has our biggest fraction of international sales running around 25% or so this year. So it’s a fairly broad, just outstanding performance by the team at ES.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Hi. Good afternoon, everyone.
Wes Bush: Hi, Noah.
James F. Palmer: Hi, Noah. How are you?
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Good. How are you?
James F. Palmer: All right.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Terrific. Always good after you read off that much pension material.
James F. Palmer: Yes, I live for it.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Wes, you mentioned talking to those in Congress about the potential for more changes to sequestration. Just big picture on that, can you provide us a little bit more color on some of the conversations that are taking place on the hill and where do you see or how you see the actual likelihood of more changes to sequestration actually occurring? It seems like we kind of see in the press certain congressmen talking about the possibility of doing that, but it doesn’t seem like there is anything particularly serious or certainly eminent. Just wondering if you can give us a little more color on the latest there?
Wes Bush: Noah, I sort of see both sides of it. I clearly see a much better informed discussion on the hill around both near-term and long-term jeopardy that our national security is being placed under with this continuing pressure downwards on the Department of Defense and quite frankly other federal agencies that are being asked to do a heck of a lot more to deal with the variety of threats around the globe that are being asked to do that greater amount of scope, if you will, at a much reduced budget. It simply doesn’t make any sense and I think there is a growing recognition of that dramatic imbalance that we have from a national security perspective. Now, whether or not that recognition translates into action depends on a lot of politics and I would not want to be in the mode of speculating on politics, but I am encouraged by the growing thoughtfulness of the discussion, the growing recognition and I think the genuine desire on the part of folks on both sides of the isle and both sides of Congress, both houses of Congress to kind of step back and rethink this. But again, there are so much political dynamics associated with the budget these days that it would be difficult to put a stake in the ground and say, yes, this is going to change. But I am encouraged by the improvement in the dialogue around this.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi.
Jason Gursky - Citigroup Inc.: Good afternoon, everyone.
Wes Bush: Hi, Jason.
Jason Gursky - Citigroup Inc.: Wes, I was wondering if you could just spend a few minutes thinking about the operational tempo in the Middle East today. It’s obviously increased here of late and maybe just describe to everybody here on the call the types of products and solutions and services that Northrop has on offer that might eventually get used in this new operational tempo that we have over there just so that we can begin thinking about impacts that this may have on Northrop if this ends up getting sustained higher level of operations over there?
Wes Bush: Thanks, Jason. Clearly, our capabilities get deployed around the globe and are addressing a whole set of issues that are evident not just in the Middle East as you’re well aware. But with respect to that particular theater, some of the things that we’re well known for and support our customers with a very focused approach are things such as intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance. We deploy a wide variety of systems that help our customers understand what’s happening, where it’s happening, when it’s happening and do that with a very high degree of precision, so the ISR part of our business is really an important part whether we’re talking the platforms that provide the presence to do it, the sensors that provide the inherent system capacity on those platforms where they’re processing that sits behind the sensors, whether it’s on the platform or to ground processing and quite frankly the sustainment of those systems. So it’s a full company effort behind the ISR mission that’s so important to all of four structure to be able to have that perceptive understanding of what’s going on. The other place we play a big role is on the command and control side. Our work that we do both at our Information Systems business and in Aerospace Systems and in Electronic Systems plays an integral role in the command and control architectures that are deployed to help address this type of situations. So I wouldn’t say that what we’re seeing right now in the Middle East represents a big uptick in any way for us, I would not want to leave that impression. But I would point out that our systems and capabilities are integral to the nation’s ability to go and conduct these types of activities and again not just in the Middle East but around the globe.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital: Hi. Good morning, guys.
James F. Palmer: Hi, Carter. How are you?
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital: Great. I just had a couple of questions around the margin. Obviously, the contract activity, the order activity around several of these new big awards imply your changeover on several of these big programs. I wonder if you could comment on the switchover to new contracts on some of those platform and what it might mean for the margin? And then just as a point of clarification, Jim, the CAS dynamics you outlined in the quarter related to the 37 million. Are those just cumulative catch-ups that are retroactive or are the pension changes going to have some sort of offsetting benefit in next year’s segment margin rates? Thanks.
James F. Palmer: Let me take the second piece of that first. The CAS benefit are essentially nine-month impact of lower CAS costs applied against the whole portfolio of contracts, some of those contracts being cost types, so the benefits flow entirely to the customer. Some of them being fixed price incentive, where we share in the benefits; others being fixed price where we capture the benefits. There will be some small benefit that continues but largely be realized I think basically this year. So there will be a small fourth quarter benefit as well that’s essentially covered in our guidance for the year.
Wes Bush: But respect to the platform activities, I would just say that each time we start out on a new contract we have a risk profile in front of us on execution and we recognize the retirement of that risk as it occurs over time. So, nothing unusual about the new contracts that we have in that regard, but I think to the point, Carter, you were making because we have a number of these new activities and E-2D is a good example of that. As we retire the risk, either we succeed at retiring the risk or we fail to retire the risk over the course of the premium, that will be reflected in the way that we booked the margins on the program.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.
Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank: Thanks. Good afternoon.
Wes Bush: Hi, Myles.
Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank: Just following up on that line of questioning though, you’ve been running 12.3 here in the last couple of quarters. We’re going to touch higher than that. You’ve seen kind of a turn for the better in the backlog. And I think one of the things you’ve talked about is you’d love to see the backlog grow and the top line start to show some signs of life, but also be mindful that that might come with some margin pressure. So as you look at '15, I mean is that the point where some of the flow-throughs of the new wins are going to start to put downward pressure on these margins that you’ve been able to drive so well?
Wes Bush: We won’t give any guidance, right, relating to '15 other than the pension outlook that Jim provided, so I wouldn’t venture into being prescriptive about '15. But I think the broader perspective is correct. As we bring on additional programs, there’s always a path, if you will, to the full margin opportunity. The commentary I’ve made in the past relates though a bit more to our capture of development work as I think everyone on the call understands, development programs generally carry a lower margin rate opportunity than do our production programs. So the extent that our backlog reflects the capture of development activities, that would tend to have more of a downward pressure on margin rates than when the backlog growth reflects the capture of additional production work.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol with JPMorgan.
Christopher Sands - JPMorgan Chase & Co.: Hi. Good afternoon, guys. It’s Chris on for Joe.
Wes Bush: Hi, Chris.
Christopher Sands - JPMorgan Chase & Co.: Hi, guys. Wanted to ask about the improvement in funded IS backlog. This has been one of the businesses that has been under some pressure, because of the short cycle. Does that improvement signal that things are improving or at least that the pressure will start to decelerate?
Wes Bush: I would characterize it as good performance, good competitive performance by the IS team. I think it’s too early to call a turn in the shorter cycle side of the marketplace. I think we’re going to have to see how the budget environment shapes up over the course of this year before we’re positioned to call that. But we are very pleased with the backlog performance and capture performance of the IS team. They’ve continued to make sure that we’re focused on the parts of the portfolio where we think we can really create value and are very focused on the competitive side of that. So it’s good work by the IS team that you’re seeing here.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.
George Shapiro - Shapiro Research: Good morning.
Wes Bush: Hi, George.
George Shapiro - Shapiro Research: Hi. How are you doing?
Wes Bush: Good.
James F. Palmer: Good.
George Shapiro - Shapiro Research: Jim, if I divide the 37 million by the 132 million, you get about 28%. So in a certain way does that give me some attempt at what your mix of business now is between fixed price, cost plus and FPI? And going forward into next year, would that mix substantially change much based on what you just said, Wes? It seems like there might be more development next year.
James F. Palmer: George, I remember back to the 10-K and I don’t think it’s the mix that’s changed much. We’re a little bit more than 50% cost type, maybe 52%, 53%; 47 fixed price. I don’t think it’s changed awful lot. The other factor as you appreciate in terms of the flow-through of the 132 million June catch-up reduction in CAS expenses just a percentage completion of the various contracts that it applies to. So I said to an earlier question, there will be some smaller fourth quarter benefit and maybe some that leads over into 2015 as well, but really not that significant in terms of the overall margin impact on a go-forward basis. And to your question basically around the overall mix, based on what I’ve seen so far in our planning process, I don’t see a lot of change in the overall mix between development contracts and production contracts as we look forward here.
Wes Bush: In particular, I would just add because we see a good set of opportunities on both the production and on the development side, if I look at our national opportunities, many of those are more production-related if we’re selling a Global Hawk or a Triton or an E-2D overseas, those would be additions to our production line. Generally, our domestic targets, the new targets, tend to have more development opportunity and I mentioned both long-range strike and some of the other things that we’re pursuing domestically would tend to have more of a development mix. So in terms of the overall opportunity set, I would align with what Jim said that we really don’t see much of a change in the mix of opportunities. Of course, it will depend on which ones we actually capture and turn into the sales [engineer] (ph) in the company.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of David Strauss with UBS.
David Strauss - UBS: Good afternoon.
Wes Bush: Good afternoon, David.
James F. Palmer: Hi, David.
David Strauss - UBS: Jim, can you talk about EACs in the quarter, what they look like overall? I know you had the settlement (indiscernible) factoring, but what do EACs look like in the quarter and maybe any color thinking about Q4 and into next year? Thanks.
James F. Palmer: Yes, I think you all know but I think you are making too much out of these EAC adjustments. The underlying margin rate is really the key factor here. EAC adjustments were down in the quarter, as I recall correctly from the Q that was filed this morning, upper 30s, low $40 million range on a year-over-year basis and quarter-over-quarter basis. And we basically look at the underlying fundamentals of our various contracts when we do our planning process and not so much how we expect to come from the underlying performance of the contracts versus EAC adjustments.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Crédit Suisse.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG: Good morning.
Wes Bush: Hi, Rob.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG: Good afternoon, I guess I should say. Hi, guys. I wanted to talk a little bit about an aspect of Better Buying Power and the sense that we’re getting the DoD is now perhaps taking a deeper look at major subcontracts in addition to the primary prime contractor contracts. And to what extent, if any, this has started to happen on F-35? My understanding is they’re really doing this with the largest programs, so clearly that would be F-35 in your position there. Are they getting involved in the negotiations and trying to help identify cost savings directly as you work with your customer?
Wes Bush: This is Wes. I wouldn’t say that that was so much a reflection of what’s going on in Better Buying Power. I think historically we’ve seen on very, very large programs where there are subcontracts that are major fractions of the acquisition. We’ve seen the government have a strong interest in understanding what’s going on and frequently the subcontractor works through the prime to support what the prime needs to get done with the government customer to provide greater insight into that larger fraction of the cost. But all that said, ultimately, the subcontractor just that there are contractual agreements between the supplier and the prime and the government’s actions need to respect that and understand it. And ultimately, they are holding the prime contractor responsible for the outcomes. So we are an industry that works very closely together to get things done. It’s kind of one of – I think the very strong positive attributes of our industry that we’re able to partner so well while we also complete. And part of that partnering process is to support whoever happens to be the prime on an individual contract, support them enabling them to get done what they need to get done with the customer community. So I don’t know that I would characterize it as a big departure clearly on something, the size of F-35 where individual companies that are not the prime have a big role. The government needs to understand what’s going on in great detail and the subcontractors need to support the prime and providing that type of insight. But ultimately, the relationship is between the subcontractor and the contractor and that has to be maintained. Since you raised the question though about Better Buying Power, I thought it might be helpful just to give a little bit of perspective on this. Our industry has been very active in working with the Department and helping to provide feedback and help to shape the ongoing evolution of the Better Buying Power initiatives. We’re now to Better Buying Power 3.0 and I think there’s a lot of good things that are coming out of this process. And clearly the opportunity to work with the Department in helping to shape what’s going on and improving the acquisition process I think is something that we all welcome. The focus that we’re seeing in Better Buying Power 3 around innovation and driving technology I think is very, very much on point and necessary for where we need to be going as a country. And as I’ve said earlier, I think I speak for most folks in the industry. We really appreciate the Department’s approach to working with us and shaping where these things go. So I think there are a lot of positives here. We have to of course make sure that the implementation of the policies that get put out really is in alignment with the intent and there have been some issues in that regard whether it’s in the appropriate use of different contract types or other aspects of it. But I think in general, this is a good architecture, a good approach to trying to improve – continuously improve what’s going on in DoD acquisition and we’re supportive of what the Department’s working to do here.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Your next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.
Hunter Keay - Wolfe Research: Thanks for getting me on, I appreciate it.
Wes Bush: Hi, Hunter.
Hunter Keay - Wolfe Research: Hi. How are you? A little bit of a schematic follow up to an earlier question I think relates to assets deployed in the Middle East right now. I’m wondering if you can be a little more specific and tell us – you talked about ISR before about how Global Hawk is being utilized and whether or not DoD or Congress is taking note of its capabilities and whether or not you think this might provide a little bit of a catalyst to get some sensor work upgrades done on Block 30? And also maybe comment how the U-2 fits into this sort of puzzle that we have here? Thanks a lot.
Wes Bush: Thanks, Hunter. I really can’t. It wouldn’t be appropriate for me to comment on how specific systems are being deployed in an operational context. I would just say broadly that as the world continues to get more challenging, we see a constant increase in deployment of assets like Global Hawk and Global Hawk specifically around the globe. The number of hours of operation continue to rise, the cost per hour continues to fall, the clarity that the commanders have around the benefits of that asset continues to improve. So we see all the things pointed in the right direction for the broad support that the DoD has been providing for Global Hawk. So we’re continuing to be very confident about its future and very supportive of what our customers are working to do to continue to enhance its operational utilizations. So, we see things as being on the right track there.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Godyn with Morgan Stanley.
John Godyn - Morgan Stanley: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Wes and Jim, we’ve heard about international opportunities from both of you, but I was hoping that perhaps we could put some numbers around it. Could you just update us on where on an enterprise level basis international is as a percent of revenue now, what it looks like as a percentage of the backlog and is a big opportunity, if there’s anything you can tell us about where you think as a percent of revenue could go in the coming years as sort of a general trajectory, I think that would be very helpful?
James F. Palmer: John, this is Jim. As you know, international has gone to about 13% of sales for 2014, up from 10% in 2013. Backlog is about 14% at this point and obviously the backlog percentage is always influenced by the timing of these large international awards. Both Wes and I have said a number of times, we see some significant opportunities in the international marketplace for our capabilities. They always take a long time to bring to fruition. Projecting exactly when they’re going to occur is frapped with problem and I’m not going to get into that.
Wes Bush: Jim, I listed a few earlier, maybe I can just reiterate some of that and perhaps add a little perspective. With respect to what we have underway at Aerospace Systems, as I mentioned in my earlier remarks, we see opportunities for our Global Hawk, Triton and E-2D and of course broadly around the company where we’re a participant on F-35, we see that growing. In Electronic Systems, we’ve been pleased to see how our SBIR radar program continues to perform well on schedule. We see that as a very, very competitive offering that we have in the marketplace and it’s generating a lot of interest around the globe. So the SBIR radar is I think going to be a nice opportunity for a number of countries that are looking to upgrade their F-16 capability. In Information Systems, we have an extensive capability in cyber that a number of our allies are quite interested in figuring out how they work with the U.S. and U.S. government in taking their steps forward where we can helpful. And I mentioned earlier the work that we do domestically in command and control out of Information Systems and there too we’re seeing an increasing interest around the globe in some of that capability to help deal with the growing complexity of the systems that many nations are acquiring now. You have to be able to network these systems together and manage them as a more integrated approach to dealing with the battle space and that’s a real expertise that we have at IS that I see a nice international opportunity. And with respect to TS, we do a fair amount of sustainment work around the globe today and we see sustainment as a growing international opportunity for TS. So every one of our four sectors has a set of meaningful opportunities as we look out over the next few years. We generally have not been in the mode of trying to set goals as a percent of revenue. I don’t see that as a necessarily productive thing to do. We are looking at each of these opportunities to see whether or not they are value creating and whether or not we’re the right company to be pursuing them, and we make our decisions on that basis. So as we go forward, given the breadth of opportunities, clearly we’re looking at a growing international business but we’re not setting specific percent of revenue targets to describe that growth.
Steve Movius: This is Steve. I’d like to thank all of you for your interest. This concludes our Q&A session of the call and I would like to turn it over to Wes for final comments.
Wes Bush: Thanks, Steve. I’ll just wrap up by reiterating how proud I am of the Northrop Grumman team’s continuing focus on driving performance for our customers and for our shareholders. This was another good quarter for us and that good quarter resulted from the commitment and hard work of the great team that we’re fortunate to have here in our company. So thanks again for joining us on the call today. We appreciate your continuing interest in Northrop Grumman.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Northrop Grumman's Second Quarter 2014 Conference Call. My name is Jasmine and I will be your operator today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. (Operator Instructions). I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Steve Movius, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Movius, please proceed.
Steve Movius: Thanks, Jasmine and welcome to Northrop Grumman's Second Quarter 2014 Conference Call. Before we start, please understand that matters discussed on today's call constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to Safe Harbor Provisions of Federal Securities Laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainty, which are detailed in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risk factors may cause actual company results to differ materially. Matters discussed on today's call may also include non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled in today's earnings release. We will be posting an updated company overview that provides supplemental information on Northrop Grumman. You can access our updated company overview and our sector overviews on the Investor Relations page at www.northropgrumman.com. On the call today are Wes Bush, our Chairman, CEO and President; and Jim Palmer, our CFO. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Wes.
Wes Bush: Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Our second quarter results reflect our team’s focus on delivering top performance for our customers and our shareholders. As a company, we continue to focus on superior program execution, affordability and innovation. I'm proud of our team's performance and their dedication to serving our customers. This strong sustained operating performance combined with favorable pension trends and share repurchases contributed the higher second quarter earnings per share. We are very pleased with the results of the half way point of the year. Based on year-to-date performance we are raising guidance for segment operating margin, total operating margin and earnings per share. Our year-to-date segment OEM rate is 12.6% slightly higher than last year's results. For 2014 we now expect a low 12% segment operating margin rate and a low 13% total operating margin rate. We are increasing our EPS guidance to a new range of 9.15 to 9.35. Second quarter and year-to-date sales are consistent with 2014 sales guidance which is unchanged at 23.5 billion to 23.8 billion. We continue to see growth in our international business partially offsetting the impact of domestic budget pressures. We expect this trend to continue in the second half of the year. Cash from operations totaled $572 million for the quarter and we ended the quarter with the cash balance of approximately $3.5 billion. We continue to expect healthy cash flow this year and our guidance for cash from operations and free-cash flow is unchanged. Turning to cash deployment. During the quarter we repurchased 6.1 million shares for 741 million. Year-to-date we've repurchased 10.9 million shares at 1.3 billion. And our weighted average diluted share count has been reduced by 9% year-over-year. And we've now passed the half way mark toward our goal of retiring 60 million shares by the end of 2015 market conditions permitting. Over the last five quarters we repurchased 31.7 million share toward that goal. In may we increased our quarterly dividend 15% to $0.70 per share again demonstrating the importance of a competitive dividend payout ratio as part of our cash deployment strategy. In addition to returning cash to shareholders we have also announced plans to increase investments primarily in our longer cycle more capital intensive aerospace systems and electronic system sectors. We’re investing in our Aircraft Integration Center of Excellence in St. Augustine, Florida and increasing investments in our Manned Aircraft Design Center of Excellence in Melbourne, Florida. And we are increasing electronic systems capital expenditures by $50 million this year. These AES and ES investments are examples of our ongoing effort to improve our strategic alignment with our customers’ need for increasingly innovative and affordable products, services and solutions. In addition to capital expenditures, we’re investing in new business opportunities and investing in our ongoing programs to reduce costs, improve affordability, and enhance competitiveness. We and our F-35 partners are investing in a blueprint for affordability initiative aimed at significantly reducing aircraft cost. This type of investment strategy represents a win-win opportunity for industry and our customers. Industry has incentivized to reduce cost and improve affordability. As we demonstrate cost reductions, we will recover our investments and have an opportunity to earn a return on that investment. Our backlog at the end of the quarter was $35.6 billion, which includes new awards of $5.3 billion. I would note that this does not include the $3.6 billion E-2D multiyear award that we received after the close of the quarter. Through the first six months of the year, we’ve captured new awards of $10.2 billion including $665 million for the F-35; $552 million for our work on Virginia-class; submarines $460 million for the F/A-18 and $299 million for the B-2. New awards for the first six months of the year represented 86% of sales. Electronic systems and information systems had book-to-bill rates close to or more than one time sales. Aerospace systems book-to-bill for the first six months of the year was impacted by the timing of the E-2D award. Looking ahead, we continue to have a robust opportunity set across the company including significant international opportunities for platforms like Global Hawk, Triton, F-35 and E-2D and in domains like C4ISR, cyber and logistics and modernization. We're pleased that our programs continue to be well supported as congressional budget negotiations progress. While we are encouraged by the tone of fiscal year 2015 budget negotiations, we remain cautious regarding the longer term vector of U.S. Defense spending, given the likelihood of another continuing resolution at the start of fiscal year 2015 and the potential sequestration in fiscal year 2016, if Congress does not act to avoid that outcome. Despite these continuing uncertainties, we are confident that the actions we’ve taken to reduce costs, drive innovation, and enhance program execution have positioned Northrop Grumman to compete and succeed over the long-term. In closing, we’re very pleased with our performance in the first half of 2014, performance that enabled us to raise our full year guidance. Now I'll turn the call over to over to Jim for a more detailed discussion of our results and our guidance. Jim?
Jim Palmer: Thanks Wes and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. As Wes said, another solid quarter. Our team continues to execute very well and I want to add my sincere appreciation for their efforts. My comments today will focus on our quarter and year-to-date sector results and I'll provide a little bit more color on our EPS guidance for the year. The increase in our EPS guidance essentially reflects our strong second quarter performance and our current expectation for a 9% reduction in weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the year. Turning to the sectors, Aerospace Systems second quarter sales declined $111 million or 4%. On a year-to-date basis, sales were down 3%. Lower volume for both periods reflects declines in unmanned systems and space programs with lower Global Hawk production activity and lower development activity on Fire Scout being the two biggest drivers of the trend. These decreases were partially offset by higher volume on the NATO AGS program.  I would note that we continue to see unmanned as a long-term growth driver for our company, particularly as international opportunities emerge. Current unmanned revenue trends reflect a normal pattern we would expect as mature production activities ramp down like the Air Force Global Hawk program and transition to and ramp up on development programs like NATO AGS and Triton. AS second quarter operating income and margin rates declined due to lower volume and quarter-over-quarter differences and risk retirement and performance improvements. But on a year-to-date basis AS operating income rose slightly and operating margin rate was very healthy at a 12.5% rate. For the year, we continue to expect AS sales between $9.7 billion and $9.9 billion and based on the strength of year-to-date results we now expect an operating margin rate of approximately 12% versus our prior guidance of high 11%. Electronic systems second quarter sales declined slightly and are 3% lower year-to-date. Both second quarter and year-to-date results reflect fewer deliveries of navigation and maritime systems as well as fewer deliveries of infrared counter measure products. Year-to-date results also were impacted by the timing of combat avionics deliveries, during both the second quarter and year-to-date declines in domestic progress will partially offset by higher international sales which have increased 12% year-to-date. ES operating income declined 10% for both periods due to lower sales and quarter-over-quarter differences in risk retirements and performance improvements. You will also recall that during the first half of 2013, ES had a benefit from a $26 million non-programmatic reserve reversal.  For the year, we continue to expect ES sales of $6.8 billion to $7 billion, with an operating margin rate in the low to mid 15% range. Our current guidance reflects second half ES margins in excess of 14%.  Information Systems, second quarter sales declined 8% and year-to-date sales are 7% lower. As you know Information Systems is our shorter-cycle business and has a greatest in-theater exposure of our four sectors. The lower government funding levels continue to impact a broad range of programs in both periods and in-theater troop dropdowns reduced sales by $43 million in the quarter and by $86 million on a year-to-date basis. Despite top line pressures, IS increased operating income and margin rate in both the second quarter and on a year-to-date basis. Second quarter income rose nearly 9% and margin rate expanded by a 150 basis points to 9.8%. Year-to-date operating income rose 1% and operating margin rate expanded 70 basis points with trends for both periods reflecting improved performance. For the year, we continue to expect IS sales of $6.1 billion to $6.2 billion with an operating margin rate in the high 9% range. Moving to Technical Systems, second quarter sales improved due to higher international sales, principally due to the Qantas defense systems acquisition which more than offset lower ICBM volume. On a year-to-date basis, sales are comparable to last year and also include higher international sales offset by lower volume across several other programs including ICBM and Hunter. For the year, we continue to expect sales of approximately 2.7 billion and we’re increasing our guidance for operating margin rate to approximately 9%. On a consolidated basis, segment operating margin rate was 12.3% in the quarter and 12.6% on a year-to-date basis. Our year-to-date 12.6% segment operating margin rate reflects improved performance partially offset by lower net favorable adjustments. As a result of year-to-date performance, we now expect a segment operating margin rate in the low 12% range, slightly higher than our prior guidance of approximately 12%. And with the higher segment operating margin rate we now expect a total operating margin rate in the low 13% range versus the prior guidance of approximately 13%. We continue to expect the tax rate of about 31.5% and I would point out that this does not include the potential renewal of the R&D tax credits. I would also note that we now expect a 9% decline in our weighted average diluted share count for the year, versus the prior guidance of about an 8% reduction. Turning to cash from operations, we generated $572 million in the quarter and a $170 million on a year-to-date basis. Free cash flow for the second quarter was $456 million with our year-to-date cash performance reflecting higher trade working capital than we had in 2013. Consistent with our historical pattern we do expect our cash flows in the second half of the year. On a year-to-date basis, capital spending increased by about $90 million and we continue to expect capital spending of about $600 million for the year. Capital spending to support the establishment of our centers of excellence has begun ramping up and we will continue to increase as we go through the second half of the year. Given our historically strong second half cash flows as well as the expectation for the ramp up in the second half of capital expenditures we remain comfortable with the outlook for our 2014 cash from operations and free cash flow guidance. A final item before I turn the call over to Steve, last quarter I mentioned the Society of Actuaries was expected to issue new proposed guidance for mortality assumptions. Those proposed changes have been issued. They’re receiving a great deal of comment and discussion and so the logical question is what does it mean? So, in holding all other assumptions constant and no change in accruable regulations the new mortality assumptions when fully implemented will likely result in increased liabilities, increased annual FAS and CAS pension expense and potentially increased funding requirements dependent upon the funding status of the company’s pension plans. The timing of the ultimately agreed upon mortality guidance and adoption requirements are uncertain but regardless of these timing issues we expect to update our mortality assumptions. Our preliminary review of our own mortality experience would suggest an increase in liabilities in the 4% to 6% range. For the applying purposes we are currently assuming that the new mortality assumptions will be in effect at year-end 2014 for the measurement of the projected benefit obligations. And if that’s the case, these new assumptions would then impact 2015 FAS pension expense. Holding the discount rate constant and expect the rate of return and all the other assumptions, we would expect that mortality rates to increase FAS expense by approximately $50 million for every 1% increase in our liabilities and cash cost would increase by about $40 million for every 1% increase in the liabilities. We don't expect adoption as a new mortality tables to impact, 2015 or 16 require contributions given our plans funded status than our product contributions and of course holding all other assumptions constant. In addition to the potential impacts of the revised mortality tables, we also need to keep in mind the Congress is currently considering a new Highway and Transportation Funding Act that which at this point includes extending the previous MAP-21 provisions that smooth pension funding requirements. An extension of the MAP-21 discount rates that would result in for example a 100 basis point increase in our CAS amortization rate would likely offset much of the near-term impact of the mortality changes. At this point, we would not expect at the MAP-21 extension that have an impact and our funding requirements for either 2015 or '16. And we do anticipate that resolution and these potential changes would occur yet this year. Just to remind you everyone of our other FAS sensitivities, a 25 basis point change in the discount rate, changes FAS expense by about a net 60 million and a 10 million basis points change, 100 basis points change in our expected rate of return on plan assets will change FAS expense by about 45 million. And finally, I would note that we expect to finalize our 2014 plan demographics in the third quarter which may impact our 2014 CAS cost. So to summarize, we now have potentially four major variables that can impact FAS and CAS cost: The discount rate; the plan returns; new mortality assumptions; and possibly a MAP-21 extension. So a lot of moving parts; obviously we are following them very closely. And we will provide updates to our assumptions and estimates as all of these elements become better known. So Steve, I think with that we are ready for questions.
Steve Movius:  Thanks Jim. As a reminder, each participant should limit themselves to a single question. Jasmine will open the line at this time. Jasmine?
Operator:  (Operator Instructions). And your first question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays. Please proceed.
Carter Copeland - Barclays:  Hey. Good morning, gentlemen or good afternoon I should say, and good quarter.
Wes Bush:  Thanks, Carter.
Carter Copeland - Barclays:  Wes, I wanted to ask a big picture question for you, because it's getting to be that time of year where everybody gets engaged in their strategic planning process. And when you look at where we are this year and where we've been in the past couple years, you were obviously doing some planning with considerable amounts of uncertainty. And I realize that per your comments, there's still a good bit of uncertainty about what may happen in ‘16 and where the ‘15 budget may come out. But when you sit down and you start crafting that long range plan, how is that different this year relative to perhaps some of the scenario analysis and stuff you've done in the prior years, and how much more emphasis are you putting on revenue growth and benchmarking on things like that as opposed to what you saw in the planning process of the prior years?
Wes Bush: Well Carter, I guess I would just provide a kind of broad view of how we see the overall environment. Clearly, the deal that was reached at the end of last year that looked out for two years that was very helpful. It provided a little bit more stability compared certainly to where we had been in the prior years. But the reality is our customers of necessity plan over a much longer cycle than two years. And I would say that they are still struggling to plan effectively, given that we have a law on the books that says the sequester returns at the beginning of 2016. Now you’ll notice, everyone else did that when the President put forward his budget recommendations, he was pretty clear that to support national security, we could not be operating at a level that was dictated by the sequester. So, there are kind of two benchmarks out there right now, one is the President's budget and the other is the sequester. And it does create some fairly substantial uncertainty in the planning arena, particularly from the customer optics as they are trying to profile out these multiyear programs and investment cycles and quite frankly as they are struggling to deal with everything that's going on around the globe, given the budget pressures that we have in place today. So, I would say that there remains a fair amount of uncertainty out there. Clearly the events around the globe, I think are highlighting the importance of strong national security capability. And hopefully as we move along through this year and get into next year, we'll have a congress that can tackle some of those challenges and come to grips again with how to really go forward on a budget perspective. In the more near term as we're thinking about next year, I am glad to see the committee is appearing to make some progress as we're going through the appropriation cycle. But I think it's increasingly clear that we're going to be in the CR as we migrate into FY15; hopefully that CR doesn't last for long time but it's hard to predict exactly how that's going to go. So there is even little bit of consternation in the near term on this process. I know there have been a number of folks out trying to make a call on what -- which year will be the trough. Just given that range of uncertainties that I just described, I think it's a little bit too early to call that. So we're thinking about this as we have continuously throughout this process with a longer term perspective, making sure that we are doing the right things that continue to position us well for the longer term, working hard on our cost structure, making sure that we're performing well and making the right investments to ensure that we’re going to be able to support our customers’ needs as we go through inevitable cycles in our industry. Jim, do you have anything you would like to add to that?
Jim Palmer:  Yes, just since we have probably a good portion of the Northrop team listening, and they all know that we're doing multiple scenario planning for our plan; I just want to reinforce your comments and the level of uncertainty that as you look at a multi-year planning process that range of uncertainty over the years dramatically escalates. And so, yes, Carter we are continuing to do multiple scenario planning even in today's environment.
Wes Bush:  I think it's just a healthy thing for any enterprise to do as well because it allows you to be prepared for a variety of outcomes and to test your decisions and your assumptions against a variety of outcomes.
Carter Copeland - Barclays: Thanks guys.
Wes Bush: Thank you Carter.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi. Please proceed.
Wes Bush: Hi Jason.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi it’s actually John. Hi, good afternoon guys. It’s actually [John Aviv] on here for Jason sorry to disappoint.
Wes Bush: Good afternoon John.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey, how are you? Quick question on about IS in the in-theater exposure. I was wondering if you could size that for us in terms of what you’re so close to there because revenue perspective and also which program that might be and given the fact that should surround the way out over the next couple of years. How much more downsize is there than at what point and what altitude do you see there for some longer-term growth?
Wes Bush: We’re going to turn to our information systems expert Mr. Movious to answer that question.
Steve Movius: Sure. The in theater for the company which is a combination of efforts over in theater as well as those contracts funded with OCO funds was about $1.1 billion last year we expect it to be about $900 million this year and IS does have the biggest piece of that. Of the $200 million decline the bulk of that is coming out of information systems. We have four programs that program areas that make up like two thirds of that sales volume and IS holds at least a couple of them. So the bake in program which quite frankly will have legs even after the in theater effort is over. The CRAM effort which will probably drop-off more materially as the in theater efforts wind down and then our electronic systems has a product area in IRCM as well as the laser business which again will drop-off somewhat, but has the long-term viability in the marketplace. So the $900 million, is it going to decline in the future yes, but a significant portion of that will continue into future year periods.
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed.
Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein: Yes, thank you.
Steve Movius: Hi Doug.
Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein: Hi. I was interested in unmanned because now when you look forward and if you’re looking at some of the opportunities out there, I’d love to hear how are you seeing them in, now that includes Navy U-Class variance of the global product platform. But what I am interested in is as you see unmanned aircraft industry mature do you see certain segments where you’re best positioned to compete perhaps others that may not suite you as well. How do you look at this market going forward today?
Wes Bush: Well that we’re very excited about the opportunities in the future on unmanned. It’s still a capability really an industry in its infancy in many respects. The great success that unmanned has enjoyed in the past decade I think is testament to the potential, but we’re really just at the very beginnings of that. At global hawk clearly kind of set stage for where things can go from our perspective. The ability to really see a large area and see it perceptively to deploy a variety of different censor capabilities and to the common integral part of the operational doctrine of how things get prosecuted. And I think really helps at the stage and then building on that with the Triton program for the Navy, the Triton program moving along very well which had some really good recent progress completing the initial flight test program and for looking forward getting into [RF] as we get into next year. And then on top of that the success we’ve enjoyed with the UCAS-D program and lending an unmanned aircraft on the deck of an aircraft carrier, all of those things I continue to see as real-stage setters for where this can go. And go not just domestically but internationally as we talked about on some of our calls and at the conferences in the past we’re seeing a growing demand by our allies around the globe for this class of capability and we’re looking forward to supporting that particularly given the support for that outcome that we’re seeing from the United States government with DOD policy focusing substantially on making sure that our allies can have this class of capability and use it in a way that’s highly integrated with U.S. operational doctrine. So there is a good path forward here, the exact timing of when particular opportunities rollout is a little bit hard to predict especially if we’re talking about international as it’s always a little bit of uncertainty and all the steps you’ve got to get through on the international side. But clearly with Global Hawk and Triton we’re seeing great interest in those capabilities in Korea, Japan, Australia and other countries and we’ve got the NATO AGS program underway in NATO today and that’s moving ahead very nicely. You mentioned the U-Class program there is a draft RFP that’s been released for comment, that’s a program where there continues to be quite a bit of discussion in both the navy and at the OSV level about the mission and its requirement so a little early to call how that one is going to go quite yet. But I think it’s just another indicator that this is an area, an arena with a lot of dynamics and a lot of opportunities. We tend to position ourselves more on the higher end of the capability and I think that serves us well in terms of being able to look ahead what our customers are going to need and invest in the near term, to make sure those capabilities are going to be present for them. There is a whole range of unmanned capability out there, everything from what you might think of as remote controlled airplanes, some people call those unmanned systems all the way to the high end of robotically flown aircraft which is really where our focus has been. And quite frankly, I think there will be some good opportunities across that spectrum of unmanned capability as we look into the future. But we will tend to be focused more on the higher end of the capability.
Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein: And do you see it as a steady source of growth in revenue, or is this something where we may have to wait a few years to really see it move?
Wes Bush: I think, there are clearly some near term things that are moving ahead in terms of driving some growth. I mentioned Triton going into LRIP, that's an important part of the process for us. I mentioned the international ones. So, I think it's, it won't be every single quarter, that we've got some great news, but if I think if it on an annual basis over the next few years, I'm continuing to be optimistic about the vector for this. And clearly over the longer term if you take a (inaudible) look, I think this will be transformative.
Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein: Okay. Well, thank you.
Steve Movius: Thanks Doug.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Yair Reiner with Oppenheimer. Please proceed.
Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer: Great. Thank you. So book-to-bill looks like it would have come in close to 1, had the E-2D contract signed in the second quarter. How are things looking for the back half of the year?
Wes Bush: So book-to-bill at E-2D had been an earlier would have been closer to 1.5 fleet. And I think E-2D is just another reminder that the long cycle businesses that we have such as AS and ES tend to get their awards in lumps. And so we have to think about that over the longer period of time.
Jim Palmer:  As well as international.
Wes Bush:  And Jim’s right, international as well comes in lumps. So we don't guide on awards to book-to-bill for the year so I won't give a projection for the second half. I would just say we're pleased with how things are going.
Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer: Great. And then if you could just rephrase or try an earlier question again about the budget trajectory. I guess if you look at even the lower budget that's out there, the sequestered budget looks like 2015 is a bottom. Obviously there is a disconnect between when there is a budget authority and when there is an outlay. But it seems that there is, things that are bit different about the cycle, there is little bit of noise from OCO and so forth. Is there a reason to think that your DoD revenues are going to be substantially different than what we see in the budget authority?
Wes Bush:  Always hard to tell. Again you made a point and the difference between budget authority and outlay. Ultimately what this comes down to is the customers’ confidence and taking a longer term view that if they start meaningful program activities they're going to be able to get then done. The last thing they want to do is get started and have a calamity on the budget side that creates great efficiency. So there are tough decisions that our customers are going to need to make over the next couple of years as best they can given the haziness of the crystal ball right now. And we'll see where that goes. I continue to see our portfolio as very well aligned with strategic directions that our customers are moving and will need to move given what's going on around the globe whether it’s unmanned, the work we do on a variety of manned aircraft systems, the work that we do in C4ISR and Cyber as well as the work we’re doing in logistics and modernization; I am really pleased with how the portfolio is aligned for the longer-term, but this business is trying to call a trough I think is time (inaudible) right now.
Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer: Okay, thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Please proceed.
Howard Rubel - Jefferies: Thank you very much.
Wes Bush: Hey Howard.
Howard Rubel - Jefferies: Good afternoon. You’ve talked about changing your investment profile or I mean frankly it’s a portion of capital that you expect to have reasonable returns on going forward. Could you elaborate on some of the decisions that went into building these new facilities and are there multiple solutions to having these facilities available to you and how is it proved your competitiveness wise?
Wes Bush: Yes, thanks Howard. Any time you make a decision to invest in a new facility you can have to test it against a variety of potential outcomes. And Jim talked a little bit earlier about the scenario work that we do and that’s an important part of it. The facilities that I mentioned in my remarks that ones in Florida in particular are locations where we not only have a great legacy of doing really good work, they are also increasingly centers where we’re able to pull our teams together and really focus the benefit of having collocated teams to come up with new ideas and propel the current programs that we have underway. So, I would say that none of the facilities that I have mentioned so far are speculative facilities on some future opportunity. These are activities and facilities and capabilities that will both benefit our ongoing business as well as positions incredibly well for some of the things that we see on the horizon. There is a natural benefit and we’ve seen this time and again across the company, a natural benefit of pulling together these steps of capabilities with people who can bring a wide variety of discipline to address some of these increasingly complex problems. And if I look at for example what we're doing in Melbourne today and the manned aircraft design center of excellence that we're establishing there, we've had a long-term just tremendous set of capabilities in Melbourne, but we've had other capabilities that we have scattered around the country. And this gives us an opportunity to pull some of those things together, get that people together in a more focused manner to drive some different outcomes for us. And I'm excited about what we already have going on there and what it will represent as we get that activity completed.
Howard Rubel - Jefferies: So just a follow-up, not only does this sort of position you for some business, future business opportunities, it also may and I don't want to use the word lower cost, but maybe improve productivity or enhance some other, I mean that’s sort where you…
Wes Bush: Yes, absolutely. From an affordability perspective, it is almost always more efficient to have teams collocated in facilities that we optimize the use of those facilities as opposed to widely distribute where we have sub-optimal utilization of multiple facilities. So there is a really important affordability and competitiveness perspective that goes into this center of excellence architecture. Jim could you?
Jim Palmer: Yes. Just our most valuable resource is our people. Allowing our people to be collocated where they can share experiences across a wide range of programs is invaluable. There is no way to really quantify the benefit that comes from being able to utilize the resources on a more effective basis across multiple programs rather than having dedicated to individual programs and then just the sharing of experiences and ideas that comes from being next to the person and seeing what they are working on and how they are approaching the problem. So yes, there is capital that’s going into facilitate the sharing of the resources but it really is how do we best utilize our people resources.
Wes Bush:  Just one last perspective on this Howard and I don’t want to beat it to death but as you know we are a company built of acquisitions. And so there are -- have still over time been sort of the reminiscence of doing things in different locations that sort of came along to the acquisitions. In some respect this is another sort of next natural step of really integrating the company in a tighter manner and standing back and looking operationally at how we are getting things done and asking ourselves the question is, is that really optimal and in some cases it wasn’t. So we are fixing that and we think we are going to get a really good benefit from that.
Howard Rubel - Jefferies: Maybe just to conclude, I mean getting the money out of Jim, I recognize probably was quite a challenge. There must be a very -- there has to be a good hurdle here, is what I'm…
Wes Bush:  Absolutely, the discipline remains high.
Howard Rubel - Jefferies: Thank you.
Wes Bush:  Thanks Howard.
Operator:  And your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
Wes Bush:  Hello Myles. 
Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank:  Thanks, good afternoon guys.
Wes Bush:  How are you?
Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank:  Good. Wes, I was wondering if we could take a path down the cyber lane. And I want to ask the question in a way of what are the enablers for you, or any defense company to succeed in moving away from the national security tier of cyber security and more into the business or even the personal commercial tier of cyber security, so more looking at it from the blockages that exist today and the potential for those blockages to be removed in the future that would open up markets for you or companies like you.
Wes Bush: Let me give kind of a broad perspective on that. First and foremost on the cyber side, our expertise and focus continues to be on the national security side of it. That's what we have been doing well for many, many years. And we see an incredible demand for that both in the U.S. government as well as in the governments of a number of our allies around the world. As you know that there is hardly a domain that is as boarder less as cyber. So, when it comes to thinking about the needs of both our country and that of our allies, those needs really do spend in a very broad way. So, we see that as a very important dimension and really I would say focusing our efforts in that direction. There are clearly concerns within our country around how this plays and broader realm; either we’re talking about the critical infrastructure or domains beyond that and I mentioned all the way to [bookings]. And we are obviously focused on how we can help in that regard. We have a lot of work that we do with U.S. government organizations, particularly with the Department of Homeland Security that has principal responsibility for the critical infrastructure and the implications of cyber vulnerabilities to the critical infrastructure. So, we're channeling a lot of our energy and capability and to making sure we're supporting DHS as effectively as we possibly we can. When it comes to more of the commercial side of this, over time we like other companies in our industry take a look at how we might use some of our technologies to help beyond our core emission area. In each of those areas, our history as we tend to find the right partners and figure out what makes the most sense; we are typically not a company on the forefront of a commercial side of markets. So we test that from time to time, we look at it from time to time and spend a lot of time talking to others who are in that marketplace to see if there is an avenue which we can both be helpful to generate some value. But I would just reinforce that our company is primarily focused on the business we're in. And we see a big opportunity there. And I want to be careful that we don't get too diluted in chasing things that really aren't up our rally.
Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank: That makes sense and I appreciate the color. Thanks Wes.
Wes Bush:  Thank you, Myles.
Operator:  And your next question comes from the line of Rob Stallard with RBC Capital. Please proceed.
Rob Stallard - RBC Capital: Thanks very much. Good afternoon.
Wes Bush:  Hi, Rob.
Rob Stallard - RBC Capital: Quick question on information systems; Wes, you mentioned this is your -- probably your shortest cycle business. I was wondering if you could give us an idea of what sort of trends you'll be seeing there in terms of better proposal activity and those bids actually being turned into awards.
Wes Bush: Well, it’s certainly our shortest cycle business. It took the quickest if you will hit when the federal budget pressures came into play and we've seen that across the industry for similar businesses. It continues to be extraordinarily competitive. Our team in information systems is doing an absolutely great job of picking up the competitions that we want to go out and pursue and being successful on them. We had a reasonable quarter in terms of awards in IS so..
Steve Movius: Actually reasonable to six months.
Wes Bush: Actually that’s right, for the last six months has been quite good. So I am very satisfied with how we’re positioned in that area. It is a business that I see is very important to our company for the long-term not only in its capabilities in the cyber arena that we were just speaking about with miles but also broadly in C4ISR and the work that we do in that domain or all of those domains that are embedded in C4ISR. IS is an absolute leader in our industry and those capabilities are core to what we do more broadly across the enterprise. So we’re testing it out like everyone else in that side of the space, but I am very, very pleased with our competitiveness the portfolio of capabilities that we have in IS, I think is strong in terms of the breadth of the support. Like all of our businesses, we continue to assess all the pieces of it and we look hard at where those are and how we see them for the long-term. But on a relative basis, I think IS is doing well.
Steve Movius: In a dead environment they’ve performed very well. 
Wes Bush: They have.
Rob Stallard - RBC Capital:  Okay. Thanks very much.
Wes Bush: Thank you Rob.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen and Company. Please proceed.
Wes Bush: Hi.
Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company: Yes. Thank you very much. Couple of questions so with the situation changing in the mid-East and Iraq and some of the other conflicts we have. Is that have any impact either positive or negative on your international sales in the near-term and as you look forward?
Wes Bush: You know, Cai I think its just a reminder that there is instability in our world and that both we in the U.S. and our allies around the globe need to be capable of dealing with those things, and does that translate into something in very near-term I really don't see that, it's hard to tell. Might there be some things that pop-up as a result of it? Yes, potentially and we do stay in very, very close contact with all of our customers around the globe to make sure that we are as responsive to as we possibly can be to their emerging needs and are looking forward for them and bringing ideas to them from a security perspective. But I would characterize what we're seeing around the globe right now as more of as having more of an impact on the (inaudible) I'm thinking about use for a more capable and robust global security environment.
Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company: Okay. And then switching to Aerospace, your margins were down I guess your EACs were down some 58 million. That is not excluding new potentials like long range striving new class. It looks like your business is switching from development to more production E2D, NATO AGM et cetera F-35. Should we on an ongoing basis expect that EACs in our sector might be coming down as you've completed the development, but then that as you move into production and as you get more form mix that maybe your inherent profitability would improve so the margins would be stable or maybe moving up excluding those two new programs I mentioned?
Wes Bush: That's great Cai. I would agree with everything that you said that could be happening. As we get, as we transition from more of a development activities into production margins generally are improving, adding more international content normally would improve margins as well. But as the major new development opportunities ahead of us well. Ultimately what happens with both the international opportunities and the new domestic development opportunities will influence what the overall aerospace margins are going to be on longer term basis.
Steve Movius:  And Cai I would add as I have said before I am delighted to have the downward pressure on our margin rates that results from taking on new development programs what that means we are being successful in competing for the new opportunities. So that’s the way we are focusing as a team we see there is substantial opportunities out there and we intend to compete for them and hopefully are successful in a significant number of them.
Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company: Clearly, you do. But if we just think about the core business, excluding those two to three programs, is it fair to assume that the profitability should start to -- should improve ex- EACs, as we move forward? Because you will have more production work and you will have more foreign work?
Wes Bush:  I don’t think you get ever to think about margins ex-adjustments, adjustments are a normal part of the business they occur every quarter at every company, even in production. So you there are always risk and opportunities that a program is looking to manage and control and the nature of estimating cost over a multi-year period to which our airplane programs that we received today take about three years to perform on them. So there are going to be risk and uncertainties, opportunities associated with every single one of those contracts and in some cases we are going to do better than we thought and maybe in other cases not as well. We are really working hard to make sure that our team understands first what are the risk and opportunities, so that we can manage them to reduce the risk and harvest the opportunities. But ultimately you're always going to have EAC adjustments.
Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.
Wes Bush: Thanks Cai.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.
Wes Bush: Hey Sam.
Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo: Hello. I wanted to go back to a comment you made about the buyback during the initial remarks, which is you went from down 8% to down 9%. And it just seems like looking at where you are at the end of the quarter in the queue, add back a lot of options, if it just stayed there, you would get pretty close to 9% for the year. So I'm just trying to think about how you're thinking about buyback. Because the second half cash flow is clearly much stronger than it was in the first half. And why wouldn't the underlying share count be going down more than the 9%, just given where you are year-to-date?
Steve Movius: Well, recognize that we are talking about the weighted average shares outstanding for the entire year. As you go through the year, every month is worth less to that average for the year. And compared to last year, we were fairly heavy in our share repurchases in the second half of last year.  So, that is a 9% reduction off of last year's average influenced by the timing of last year's share repurchases. So at this point, our ability to get substantially greater reduction in weighted average shares for this year is relatively small.
Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo: Okay. That's fair. And if I can just follow up on the E2D multi-year that was just signed. When does that, when does work on that contract start and is it the type of thing where you do get a margin degradation kind of going back to the question just before, when you first start and then you have to work your way back up to a better margin?
Steve Movius:  Actual work has started on that multi-year contract and it will typically has a traditional U-shaped approach associated with it. So start off small as we get into the more production and deliver aircraft, again we're recognizing aircraft when recognizing revenue when aircraft are delivered here. So the revenue recognition is going to be more back and loaded. And we're estimating costs for a multi-year contract five years we're likely to start off at a somewhat conservative margin rate and then as we go through time and realize the opportunities and minimize the risk have the opportunity to step up margins.
Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo: Okay, thanks.
Operator:  And your next question comes from the line of John Godyn with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. 
Wes Bush:  Hi, John.
John Godyn - Morgan Stanley:  Hi, thank you for taking my question and congrats to Steve on his extended responsibilities. I wanted to talk a little bit about revenue. It just seems like on a few of these segments aerospace ISPS you're tracking high versus the full year guidance. You didn't revise the revenue guidance in those segments and I am just curious if there is any kind of specific puts and takes that would highlight that might be driving a sequential downtick?
Wes Bush:  The revenue is always influenced by timing of deliveries or on the cost to cost contracts by the timing of cost and cost is many times influenced by sub-contracted deliveries. And so those kind of factors when are deliveries actually going to occur and we obviously have a schedule we can predict based on the schedule but we work hard to try to accelerate to the schedule and at times if we have supply issues or other issues, we may slip the schedule for a few days and or a month weeks whatever. We’re talking about multi-billion dollar products then it take too much to affect revenues. And then just the cost, cost as I said largely influenced again we have a pretty good sense of our cost of people, people related cost, timing of sub-contractor cost can have a significant impact on revenue on a quarter-to-quarter basis.
John Godyn - Morgan Stanley: Got it. So you wouldn’t flag anything in particular driving…
Wes Bush: Not at all.
John Godyn - Morgan Stanley: Got it. Thanks guys.
Steve Movius: Hey Jasmine, this is Steve. I think we got time for one more.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
Joe Nadol - JPMorgan: Thanks guys.
Wes Bush: Hi Joe. 
Joe Nadol - JPMorgan: Hi. So, Wes your backlog has been ticking down a little bit still but the rate of decline seems to have abated quite a bit over the last few quarters. I was wondering if you felt the same way if you feel a little bit more a little better about the bookings environment more generally. I know you’re not going to give a target you already answered that question you’re not going to start giving bookings guidance but maybe just some big picture color. And then specifically you have an E2D that you already have in Q3, obviously the LRSB looking into next year, what are the other big opportunities domestic and international if you look over the next 6 months to 12 months?
Wes Bush: Yes, thanks Joe. It’s one of those environments where well it’s tough, it makes everybody focus a little bit more on competitiveness and I’ve been pleased with the competitiveness of our enterprise. It's delightful to see that we're being successful on a wide variety of fronts and what we're taking on. But as I said in my earlier comments, I am a little bit reluctant to get out ahead of what we see going on in the budget cycle because there is just a lot of uncertainties there yet. And it's important that we all be as clear as we can about the uncertainties that we see. We do have a number of great opportunities in front us. I spoke a little bit earlier in response to Doug’s question on unmanned about some of the international opportunities we see there on the unmanned side. On international, historically electronic systems has been our primary business with about 20% to 25% depending on the year, the sales that ES being international and ES is doing very well and pursuing its international business. And I think this year there will be some place around 25% on their sales internationally. So kind of the new story for us on international is on the Aerospace Systems side of things, both unmanned that I spoke about earlier as well as some opportunities on the manned side whether we're talking about our part of F-35 or the E-2D international opportunities. So we're excited about that. And I also mentioned a little bit earlier in response to Myles question on cyber that cyber also represents some interesting international opportunities for us. So, we do see international is continuing to be a growing part of our business this year, as we've said before are up on international relative to where we were last year, last year was around 10% income our sales and we expect to be about 13% this year on international. Domestically, clearly there are some big and meaningful opportunities out there, one of the most important of which is long range strike. But in addition to that at AS we are looking hard at the U-class opportunity that I talked about a little bit earlier. And at ES there are a number of upcoming decisions where there is three dealer program that we may yet hear about this year or the (inaudible) program which looks to be on track for decision in the early part of next year. Those represent great opportunities for us as well. So there is a lot that we are out there pursuing but to be successful of that we have to continue to perform on our programs that we have today. We have to continue to work on our competitiveness, some of the investments that I talked earlier in response to Howard’s question, our focus on that very thing making sure that we are going to be competitive for the future and can bring forward very affordable offerings for our customers. So we continue to see a nice profile of opportunities out there.
Joe Nadol - JPMorgan: Thanks.
Wes Bush:  Thank you, Jeff.
Steve Movius: Well, this concludes the Q&A portion of the call. Wes, final comments?
Wes Bush:  Well thanks Steve. As I said earlier the first half of the year has again demonstrated that our team’s focus on performance is enabling us to do well for our customer and for our shareholders. So thanks everyone for joining us on the call today and thanks for your continuing interest in our company.
Operator:  Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Northrop Grumman's First Quarter 2014 Conference Call. My name is Glenn, and I will be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Steve Movius, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Movius, please proceed.
Stephen C. Movius: Thanks, Glenn, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's First Quarter 2014 Conference Call. Before we start, please understand that matters discussed on today's call constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to safe harbor provisions of federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainty, which are detailed in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risk factors may cause actual company results to differ materially.

On the call today are Wes Bush, our Chairman, CEO and President; and Jim Palmer, our CFO. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Wes.
Wesley G. Bush: Thank you, Steve. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Our team is off to a good start for the year, with a solid first quarter set of results. We continue to focus on superior program execution, affordability and innovation in our drive to achieve strong sustainable results. We're proud of our team's performance and the continued focus on delivering value for our customers. First quarter earnings per share increased 30% to $2.63. Excluding this quarter's tax benefit for the partial resolution of the IRS examination of tax years 2007 through 2009, earnings per share grew 18%. Strong operating performance, favorable pension trends and the reduction in share count were the primary drivers of this quarter's results. We were also pleased to see the increase in awards relative to the first quarter of last year. First quarter sales were consistent with our guidance for the year. We continue to see lower volume for programs associated with in-theater troop withdrawals, program ramp-downs and program transitions. Growth in our international business is partially offsetting these impacts. We expect these trends to continue with declines in domestic programs being partially offset by higher volume for international programs, which represented 14% of our year-end backlog. First quarter segment operating margin rate increased to 12.9%, primarily due to strong program performance. Total operating margin rate was 14.4%, reflecting operational strength and favorable pension trends. During the quarter, we repurchased 4.8 million shares for $564 million. Share repurchases reduced weighted average shares outstanding by approximately 9%. As of March 31, we had repurchased 25.6 million shares or more than 40% toward our goal of retiring 60 million shares by the end of 2015, market conditions permitting. Cash from operations was a use of approximately $400 million, principally due to higher working capital, and we ended the quarter with cash of approximately $3.9 billion on the balance sheet. As you know, the first quarter is typically our lowest in terms of cash generation. Jim will provide more detail on cash later in the call, but I would note that we continue to expect healthy cash flow for the year and we are maintaining our full year guidance for cash from operations and free cash flow. Backlog at the end of the quarter was $36.2 billion, which includes new awards of $4.9 billion. We had solid award trends in 3 of our sectors. Electronic Systems had a book-to-bill of 111%. Information Systems had book-to-bill of 92%, principally due to awards in cyber solutions. Technical Services also had solid awards this quarter. Aerospace Systems, with a book-to-bill of 60%, was impacted by timing of awards. As our longest cycle business, awards here tend to be larger and less frequent. Although our customers continue to cope with declining budgets and the threat of sequestration returning in 2016, most of our programs were well supported in the President's fiscal year 2015 budget. And over the long term, we see a significant set of opportunities aligned with our core capabilities, both domestically and internationally. In OEM, we were pleased that the President's budget proposal specified Global Hawk as our nation's high-altitude, long-endurance ISR platform for the future. The program is currently on contract for long-lead advance procurement for 3 Global Hawks in Lot 11 and the President's budget calls for funding a future upgrade and sustainment efforts. Our team worked very hard to improve Global Hawk's affordability, and this program is a good example of effectively combining innovation and affordability to produce a good outcome for our customer. In recognition of our performance and cost-effectiveness, the Air Force awarded the Global Hawk team the Roche Sustainment Excellence Award for the second year in a row. Last month, Korea signed a letter of offer and acceptance for the acquisition of Global Hawk Block 30s, an important first step toward finalizing a contract. The Royal Australian Air Force also announced its interest in acquiring Triton for its future maritime high altitude surveillance, and several other countries have expressed interest in both Global Hawk and Triton. We see international sales of our HALE platforms as a robust long-term opportunity. Regarding the UCAS-D platform, we continue to demonstrate its utilization in the carrier environment. The National Aeronautic Association recently honored our X-47B demonstrator team with aviation's highest honor, the Collier Trophy, for developing the first unmanned autonomous air system to operate from an aircraft carrier. Our UCAS-D experience provides a strong foundation for our future efforts in unmanned systems. On the manned military side, we and the navy are working towards a multi-year agreement for the E-2D Advanced Hawkeye, which continues to be very well supported in the budget. The F-35 also continues to be a priority program, and we expect it will be an additional source of international growth. And while we can't say much about the long range strike opportunity, it is a high priority effort for the Air Force, and an important opportunity for Northrop Grumman. Our space programs are well supported in the budget. The FY '15 budget provides for incremental funding of SBIRS GEO 5 and 6, and SBRIS RDT&E funding is consistent with prior expectations. For advanced CHF, the FY '15 procurement plan continues the incrementally funded block buy of satellites 5 and 6. Information Systems, the incumbent on the navy's kings [ph] development contract, is competing for the follow-on production work, which is expected to be awarded later this year. Beyond this CIRCM program, the next-generation countermeasure system, slated to protect rotary wing aircraft is an important competitive opportunity for our Electronic Systems team. ES successfully completed acceptance testing on the first CIRCM suite of equipment 2 months ahead of schedule. ES will now compete for the EMD phase, which is expected to be awarded next year. CIRCM has the potential to be a multibillion dollar opportunity over the life of the program. ES has also competed for 3DELRR, the Air Force's next-generation long-range radar system. This competition is expected to be decided this year, and would also likely to have potential for future international sales. So while the U.S. budget environment continues to be challenging, particularly for our short-cycle businesses, we had a good long-term set of opportunities that includes the potential for continued growth in international sales. Based on first quarter results and our financial outlook for the remainder of the year, we are increasing our earnings per share guidance to a range of $8.90 to $9.15, from our prior range of $8.70 to $9. We continue to expect sales of $23.5 billion to $23.8 billion, and we are maintaining our [indiscernible] of $2.3 billion to $2.6 billion in cash from operations, and $1.7 billion to $2 billion for free cash flow. So now I'll turn the call over to Jim for a more detailed discussion of our results and our guidance. Jim?
James F. Palmer: Thanks, Wes, and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. As Wes said, just another solid quarter. Our team continues to execute in a demanding environment, and I also want to express my sincere appreciation to them for their continuing dedication. My comments will focus on sector results and our cash outlook for the year. So starting with the sectors. Aerospace, where sales declined by $65 million or 3%. The volume decline was largely in space programs and unmanned systems, with the unmanned volume decline primarily due to lower production activities on Global Hawk and Fire Scout. These declines were partially offset by higher volume on the NATO AGS program. Operating income increased by 20% due to strong performance and a $48 million increase in net favorable adjustments. The higher level of adjustments was across several contracts, none of which were material on an individual basis. For the year, we continue to expect sales to range between $9.7 billion and $9.9 billion, and we expect AS will have a margin rate in the high 11% range, versus our prior guidance of mid to high 11%. Turning to Electronic Systems, first quarter sales declined by 4% due to timing of deliveries for various combat avionics programs, as well as the lower deliveries of navigation and maritime systems. Declines in these areas were partially offset by double-digit growth in international activities. Operating income declined 9% and operating margin rate declined by 90 basis points. You might recall that last year's first quarter benefited from the reversal of a $26 million non-programmatic risk reserve. While this year, ES had favorable adjustments of $57 million, which were $23 million lower than last year. So for the year, we continue to expect sales of $6.8 billion to $7 billion, with an operating margin rate in the low to mid 15% range. At Information Systems, first quarter sales declined by 6% or about $100 million. IS experienced lower funding across a broad number of programs, including a decline in about $40 million due to in-theater troop drawdowns. The decline in IS first quarter operating income was in line with that lower revenue, and operating margin rate was comparable to last year's first quarter. For the year, we continue to expect sales at IS to range between $6.1 billion and $6.2 billion, and we now expect that IS margin rate in the high 9% range versus our prior guidance of mid 9%. Moving to Technical Services, first quarter sales declined 3%. Lower revenues reflect volume declines for the Hunter and ICBM programs, partially offset by higher volume for the KC-10 program. During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of Qantas defense systems, and TS operating income and operating margin rate increased due to improved performance. For the year, we continue to expect sales of approximately $2.7 billion, with a high 8% margin rate. On a consolidated basis, first quarter segment operating margin rate improved to 12.9%, 60 basis points, and included a $23 million increase in net favorable adjustments. The remaining performance improvements reflects the higher booking rates across our portfolio that resulted in part from EAC adjustments in prior quarters. As a result of this quarter's strong performance, we're increasing our full year guidance for segment operating margin rate to approximately 12%, and we now expect a total operating margin rate of approximately 13%. I would also note that we had a lower tax rate this quarter. This quarter's 23 point -- 26.3% effective tax rate reflects a $51 million benefited -- benefit related to the partial resolution of the IRS examination of our 2007 to 2009 tax returns. This quarter's benefit from the partial resolution of that IRS exam is higher than what we had assumed in our initial 2014 guidance. And as a result, we now expect an effective tax rate of about 31.5% for the year. Last year's first quarter effective tax rate includes a $20 million benefit related to the reinstatement of the research tax credits. On the other hand, our 2014 guidance does not include the potential renewal of the R&D tax credit at this point. Our lower effective tax rate, combined with this quarter's strong segment operating income, were the primary drivers of the increase in our 2014 EPS guidance. Turning to cash from operations, we used $402 million in the quarter. That cash use was principally driven by changes in trade working capital, largely influenced by the timing of cash receipts, including the burn-down of international advances. As you know, the first quarter is typically our lowest quarter for cash generation, and we are seeing this same trend this year, but there are a couple of items that also drove the higher working capital. And that is on the balance sheet that advanced payments declined by more than $200 million from year end, and as I mentioned earlier, that material rate decline resulted from the burn-down of international advances. Also, you may recall that we had a very strong cash generation at the end of last year, some of which was a pull-forward of payments for aerospace programs that we would've expected in the first quarter of this year. Free cash flow for the quarter was the use of $462 million, with capital spending in the quarter of $60 million, up from $40 million last year. We did continue to expect capital spending of approximately $600 million for the year, capital spending to support the establishment of our centers of excellence will be ramping up in the second quarter. And as many of you know, our capital spending is typically weighted towards the second half of the year, which will also be the case this year. As Wes indicated, we're comfortable with our 2014 cash outlook from cash from operations and free cash flow. One final item before I turn the call over to Steve for questions and answers. And that at sometime later this year, the Society of Actuaries is expected to finalize new guidance for mortality assumptions. For national reporting purposes, these new assumptions are likely to be in effect at year-end 2014 for the measurement of our projected benefit obligations. If that is the case, these new assumptions would then impact 2015 FAS pension expense. The mortality assumptions used in the trend in our future CAS expenses would also need to be revised. The new assumptions, when fully implemented, will likely result in increased liabilities, increased annual FAS and CAS pension expense and potentially, increased funding requirements depending upon the funding status of the affected plans. This applies in all cases, holding all other assumptions constant, and with no change to applicable funding regulations. In our case, even if the new mortality assumptions were to be immediately required for funding purposes, year 2016, we would not expect a substantial increase in required plan contributions, given our plan's funded status, our prior contributions and, of course, holding all other assumptions constant. So Steve, with that, I'd like to invite everybody [ph] for Q&A.
Paul Gregory: Thanks, Jim. [Operator Instructions] Now with that, Glenn, we are ready to begin the Q&A session.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.
Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: It's actually Amit Mehrotra here for Myles. Had a quick question on share repurchase. You're executing well to your plan to retiring 25% of the shares by the end of next year. But it'd be helpful to get your thoughts on how you're thinking about share repurchase beyond that. Should we expect a shift in strategy, maybe from cash allocation away from share repurchase more to M&A? Can you just offer some thoughts on that? And where does acquisitions also rank, when you look out beyond 2015 as well?
James F. Palmer: Somewhere in April of 2014, and our plan, as we have announced, really carries us through 2015, so I really wouldn't want to today speculate what might be going on in our environment and how we might be thinking about things at the end of 2015. All I would say is, if you kind of look back over the last number of years, and look at how we've been approaching cash deployment, our priorities remain the same. We like investing in our business. We want to make sure we're doing a good job of managing our balance sheet. And of course, we're wanting to make sure that we're doing a good job of returning cash to shareholders. So I would say we're a fairly predictable crowd in that regard.
Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And just a quick follow-up with respect to the backlog. Could you just offer any color on where you see that shaping up by the end of the year, and maybe provide some of the major awards out there that we can expect in the coming quarters?
Wesley G. Bush: We don't guide on awards for the year. As I noted in my remarks, we clearly had a, I think, a respectable quarter in terms of awards. And as I think about the set of opportunities that are in front of us, predicting the exact timing quarter-to-quarter is always a little bit of a challenge, given how things are tending to move around a little bit with the RFP dates and the rest. But we see ourselves well positioned, as I said in my opening remarks, across each of our sectors for a number of important opportunities that are both the remainder of this year and in the next year. So many of those are competitive opportunities that I mentioned, but it's a -- also an important perspective to understand about our company, that much of our sales in year derive from our current backlog. In fact, we expect that about 80% of our revenues this year flow directly from our backlog in the company.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I just wanted to follow up on some of the color you gave in the segments. In aerospace, where you cited lower unmanned, can you quantify how much of that came down? And can you paint when the total unmanned revenue contribution bottoms? I know some things are moving higher, some are moving lower. And then in IS, when you're citing in-theater reductions, can you quantify what that total contribution is to the segment at this point, and how it progresses from here?
James F. Palmer: Yes, no, Jim, obviously. As we said, IS sales, for example, were down roughly $100 million, the in-theater stuff is less than half of that. So again, in IS, you get --
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: In terms of the change?
James F. Palmer: Pardon?
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: In terms of how much it changed?
James F. Palmer: Yes. And then in terms of unmanned, basically, unmanned is largely flattish on a year-over-year basis. Some small -- it's a little bit greater declines on, as I mentioned, the 2 programs, Global Hawk and Fire Scout, and then growth in NATO AGS and [indiscernible] down. It's phenomenal.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Is the unmanned business growing, once you're out of 2014?
James F. Palmer: I believe so.
Wesley G. Bush: Yes, I think if -- when, if you look back at the remarks I made about the set of opportunities that we have in front of us, clearly, getting Triton into production is the, I would say, the biggest lever, the biggest step, and we're going through the test program today, and that's doing well. But the international side of unmanned is also quite intriguing. I mentioned earlier about the step forward in Korea with the LOA, and the growing interest that we're seeing around the globe in our High Altitude Long Endurance programs, what we call our HALE programs, both Global Hawk and Triton-based platforms. So we see a lot of opportunity in unmanned in front of us.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And sorry, just so I'm clear on IS, with the in-theater revenue, what is the absolute dollar number, not the rate of change, but just how much it still is, on an absolute dollar basis?
James F. Palmer: Well, across the company, we're looking at about $800 million, as I recall. Steve, is that right? Yes.
Stephen C. Movius: It's a $300 million reduction.
Wesley G. Bush: $300 million over -- from last year.
James F. Palmer: Year-over-year, but $800 million for the year.
Wesley G. Bush: Yes, across the company.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And how much of that is in IS?
James F. Palmer: 2/3, 3/4, something like that.
Stephen C. Movius: The reduction is probably -- 40% is IS.
Wesley G. Bush: Yes.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen & Company.
Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: So I think you said, you expect your foreign business to go from roughly 10% to 13% of the total. I mean, it's a little tough to tell exactly what that is with rounding, but it looks like that implies a gain of about 25%. And you've mentioned several times the opportunity of HALE, F-35. Can you give us some color on where we should see that going next year? And where do you see this in like 3 to 4 years as a percent, maybe give a range?
James F. Palmer: Cai, it's always difficult to time the exact point when all these international opportunities occur. For me, what's positive is that increasing interest across a number of countries in our High Altitude Long Endurance platforms. So again, I'm not going to call to exactly when that will occur. Getting Korea done will be an important first step. I believe that is important not only because of the opportunity, but it serves to facilitate the next move behind it. So again, we're working very hard on Korea. We have a Letter of Offer and Acceptance, and the next step is to get that under contract. That's what our team is working on.
Wesley G. Bush: And Cai, I would just add, in addition obviously to kind of a newer story for us, in international being our unmanned opportunities, as well as potentially some manned opportunities of the platforms like E-2D, we continue to have a robust international business and set of opportunities through our Electronic Systems organization. And in fact, all 4 of our sectors are focused on a set of international opportunities. Jim's point about the predictability of timing, it is a very important one in the international business, but we are very focused on this, and are working it broadly across the entire enterprise today.
Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Right. And while I realize it's always difficult to pinpoint the timing, it certainly looks like F-35 clearly is going to be a plus there. HALE clearly will be a plus. If you look out 3 to 4 years, so that we're not timing it exactly, I mean, could this be 20% to 25% of your sales? Or any rough range you could give us?
Wesley G. Bush: It again is kind of hard to say, so much of what we do on export also depends on the nature of export control restrictions. And I'm delighted with what I see happening today with the administration working hard to move things ahead as extensive commitment in DoD to step out and help through our policy changes that will enable the U.S. to better support its allies around the globe. But there are a lot of factors in the mix here that make it difficult to put a number or even a range of numbers on at this point. But the vectors seem to be aligning in a very positive direction.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi.
Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: So a big picture question that kind of follows on the heels of the spirit of Cai's questions as well, in trying to get a sense of timing that, as you suggest, the exact timing is always difficult. But in looking at the fiscal '15 budget, the program decisions that were made within that, and putting OCO aside, and into your revenue streams that you've had, and then just looking at your base domestic business, do you have a sense of, the fiscal '15 budget's implemented, when you might see a trough for domestic revenue streams. But Cai's looking at the long-term trajectory of international, and I'm just kind of curious, given what you see in the fiscal '15 budget, when you think the domestic budget, the OCO aside, stabilize.
James F. Palmer: Yes, the way I would characterize that is, first and foremost, obviously, we're all delighted to be operating right now under a real appropriations. This is a big step forward from where we had been in terms of predictability and the ability to plan and with the Bipartisan Budget Act that came together at the end of last year, it does, and I think this was a part of your question as well, it does offer a better outlook in terms of predictability and stability for '15 as well. So yes, I think the real question is what happens after that? And there are a range of possibilities, and sequester budget is a real possibility. I think the President rightfully put forward to the Congress in the longer-term outlook, a very strong message about what's really needed to support the security of our nation. And the budget profile that came forward in the plan that the President submitted is above the sequester level. How all that will work out through the politics over the next couple of years, and I think it would be foolish to speculate on that at this point. I do think it's rational to expect that the U.S. budgets will eventually stabilize, and clearly, investments in security are going to need to start growing again. But at what rate and exactly when, I wouldn't want it to be in the spot of trying to predict that right now. So we'll have to stay tuned. I think there's a lot of work to be done to get the budgeting process in the right place to support national security as we work our way through '15 and really take on the challenges associated with that range of possibilities in '16 and beyond. And I know a lot of folks have tired on the discussion around the sequester. But I think we should all be realistic and understand that they're still an important set of policy decisions and budgetary decisions that are out there in front us that we're going to be taking on as we go through this year and next year.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein.
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: I'm interested in how 2 things might affect your F-35 margins, and the first one is volume. And as F-35 quantities are down in the President's budget, particularly for the C model, and then a sequestration in 2016 would lead to some further reductions, I'm interested in how, and knowing that you do have volume considerations in pricing, that could affect your margins? And then second, over the past year, the program office has made a point to try and look beneath the prime into costs in the subcontractor community. I'm just interested in the volume question, and then the change in the way the program office is looking at the program. Does this impact you at all, in terms of what your margin expectations are?
James F. Palmer: Doug, the volume's, is a very important contributor, probably the most important contributor to our ability to drive down the learning curve. So volume is really important. We've been coming down a very healthy learning curve already. But as you point out, volume is critically important to being able to continue driving down that learning curve.
Wesley G. Bush: Yes, and let me maybe talk about the perspective on the program office side of it. I -- the way I would frame this is, Lockheed is, I think doing a very good job as the prime on this program. This is a team, and so we have a big part to play as other companies, in making the program successful. And so naturally, the program office is very interested in what the major teammates are doing and how that's going, so I don't see anything unnatural in the process that has been underway. I think it's sort of a natural step here, particularly as we are, together, very focused on, to Jim's point, how we deal with the volume challenges that are out there in the near term, and maintain an appropriate path forward on driving down the curve and driving the affordability that we know is so important for this program, both domestically and internationally. So I would characterize it more as the framework of the team environment that we need clearly with Lockheed on the front as the prime, and doing the things that are very, very appropriate for the prime to be doing. But I could see -- I continue to see a very good team environment on F-35, and I think that's part of what is contributing to enhancing the success of the program that we're having now. So I'm positive about the way we see F-35 operating today.
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: So given that performance improvements that you and others in the program have made, if you balance that off against some of these other pressures, such as volume, would you say, as you look forward, you're more or less optimistic on your ability to get a good margin progression going forward?
Wesley G. Bush: Well typically, as we move forward in a program and move into the production phases, that's where the industry has an expectation of making margin, is in production. We've all made substantial investments in this program, and continue to make investments in the program, and that is sort of a natural cycle. So I don't have any different expectations and what experience would tell us should be the outcome.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about Aerospace Systems and you threw -- you put out the $48 million worth of adjustments. Can you just talk about, is there any particular program that's a bigger percentage of that? And what was, I guess, contemplated in the earlier guidance that might've just been later in the year versus something that was new performance?
James F. Palmer: You hit on an important point, and that is timing. Many times, our EAC adjustments are tied to specific events as they occur. We did have some of those events occur in the quarter that affected the timing of adjustments. As our guidance would indicate, the 13.4% for the quarter is not what we would expect aerospace to land for the full year. So there are clearly some of those items affecting the first quarter. As I said in my prepared comments, none of the adjustments on an individual contract basis were material. As I think that's a pretty good summary of what happened in the quarter, just a good, strong underlying operating performance and then some events that were tied to those timing aspects of the -- managing the programs.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay, and if I can follow up, something unrelated, is May, is typically when you look at some of your annual dividend, and I know that you typically have very payout-focused, but I'm just wondering, is there anything about the capital deployment strategy that would change the way you look at that and the type of decisions you might make?
Wesley G. Bush: Sam, it's Wes. You guessed May is typically when we look at that. That is a board level decision. I would not want to get out in front of that level of decision. I would simply say what I said earlier, our approach to capital deployment and priorities in capital deployment have not changed.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada.
Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: There's been some talk recently about the recent green book that came out, and what the DoD is projecting for outlays this year? I was wondering if you looked at this, and how it tally with your revenue forecast for the year, particularly on shorter cycle areas?
Wesley G. Bush: Yes, Rob, we've of course, looked at it, and I will tell you, we did not see anything in the green book that altered our outlook for 2014. I think I mentioned earlier that over 80% of our 2014 revenues tend to flow from our backlog. And when you look at what's in the green book, clearly, there's a lot of work done to pull that together. The green book forecast really do not represent contractual ceilings and outlays, which are typically quite a bit lower than Budget Authority. The Budget Authority does represent kind of what the limit is, so you need to be looking at the BA aspects of things. So the short answer to your question of whether or not we saw anything in the green book that changed our outlook, the answer's no.
James F. Palmer: And obviously, the green book came out after we gave our forecast for the year, outlook for the year, and haven't changed our sales guidance.
Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: And just an unrelated follow-up, the acquisition you made in Australia this quarter, I was wondering if you can give us some of the background there of what this adds to the portfolio, and whether we can expect further bolt-ons going forward?
Wesley G. Bush: Rob, we look routinely across the board at opportunities such as this. We've not been a very major acquirer for quite a few years, and I think that reflects the discipline that we have in looking at potential opportunities. This was like a very nice fit, and I think it's going to be a very nice fit for us. It dovetails with the work that we're doing in our Technical Services organization, both domestically and internationally, Australia is a very important ally of the United States, clearly a very important market for Northrop Grumman. And so the fit, from a portfolio perspective and a geographic perspective and a market perspective, we found to be very attractive.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies.
Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: I'm going to, kind of go in a different direction. I mean, there is an expression, Willie -- I think Willie Sutton, they said, wherever Willie Sutton was, he's going to rob a bank, or where the money is, he'll go rob the bank, and your guys are banging your head to some degree against the wall with some of the difficulties that exist either in foreign sales or in DoD, and not to say that's not your expertise, but then there's these guys in Silicon Valley that are trying to spend billions of dollars solving problems that you've solved many times over, Wes. And so why aren't you approaching some of those companies, or doing something to take advantage of all that money that's sloshing around, solving problems you've addressed before?
Wesley G. Bush: Howard, I do appreciate your question, because it's a good, kind of a sanity check sometimes to look at all the things going on in the world around us and try and test what makes sense. One of the things that I think we've learned, I would say in our company, and I think generally across our industry is that, we are quite good at what we're good at, and we tend to want to stay focused on that. And periodically, we do look at what other companies are doing and market access that they may provide to see if there are reasonable partnership opportunities and we explore those from time to time. We've had, I would say, across our industry, some notable successes in that regard, as well as some abysmal failures in that regard. So I think it's just prudent to be very careful and thoughtful about how you go about doing those things. But we are a very technologically oriented enterprise. I have mentioned a number of times, our -- of our 65,000 employees, more than 30,000 are degreed scientists, engineers, mathematicians. This is a very, very capable enterprise when it comes to advancing the state-of-the-art on technology. And we have both an interest in partnering where we see that it makes sense. But also, we have, and we take this very, very seriously, an obligation to our customer community to very carefully protect the technologies that are utilized from a national security perspective. And so we're careful and diligent about balancing that out.
Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: So should I take that to mean that some of these things that are percolating in the commercial -- I mean, I get it, how should I say it? It's hard to sell into a market that's got different requirements than what you're selling into now. And it's your point on testing your comfort zone, though these rewards might be fairly lucrative and they change the valuation of the enterprise. And they -- I mean, as you know when you were TRW, periodically, there were great successes, but also there was --
Wesley G. Bush: There were.
Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: There were also some "oops."
Wesley G. Bush: And I think we've all learned from both of those sides of the experience curve, and recognize that there are value-creating opportunities periodically. You simply need to select your partners carefully. You need to have a very clear view of what the real channels to market are, and you need to be ready and willing to turn things off if it's not panning out. And that guides a lot of our thinking, and how we approach these things.
Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: So I'm just trying to draw you into an answer that is that some of these things have some appeal, or we tested them and no, thank you very much, we're very comfortable in our space?
Wesley G. Bush: I would say that part of being a good partner is to protect the privacy of your partnerships. And so we're very careful about anything that we would say about that too broadly. But the one thing that we do say, when we get out on campus to young folks that are thinking about their options, and there's an incredible competition for talent in the technical space these days, if you really want to work at leading edge technology and advance it, our industry is the place to be.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol of JPMorgan.
Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: So Wes, I have a question for you that's been kind of brewing for -- since the last quarterly call, which is on your CapEx plans, because you guys have been pretty tight-fisted, I think in a good way, in terms of your spending in all kinds of ways, including CapEx, the last couple of years. You've talked about aerospace centers of excellence as really kind of the key driver of the plane going forward. And I wondering if you could maybe take a couple minutes and give a little bit more on what you're doing and why you're doing it. Is it about more of a productivity or business capture? Is it programs that you already have, or ones that you're chasing, just a little more on the investment?
Wesley G. Bush: Yes, Joe. I appreciate the question. Aerospace Systems is certainly a big part of our enterprise. And as you've heard us talk today about the set of opportunities that we see in the future, from our perspective, that set of opportunities is adequately robust to merit investment, to make sure that we're doing the right things to be able to pursue those opportunities, as well as to execute on those that we've already captured. If you turn the clock back quite a few years ago, we are a company, like many in our industry, built through acquisition, and that had not necessarily resulted in the most efficient structure and architecture for how to get things done. So as we have worked hard to clarify our strategy, to make decisions in our company about what markets spaces we're really going to pursue and invest in, versus those that we are not, it's become clear, had become clear over the last couple of years that we needed to re-architect our footprint to better align with that strategy. And the benefits that we see from these centers of excellence are really severalfold, and I think you touched on them in your question. One is, our ability to better align the human capital that makes these things work, into centers of excellence where the people who are working on similar things are more closely co-located, and we can better share the knowledge as well as to create new opportunities by having individuals more closely working together on a day-to-day basis. Secondly, the efficiency of the facility infrastructure itself has the opportunity to be dramatically enhanced with the investments that we're making. And so we see that as very, very meaningful and important, from a competitiveness standpoint, as we take on some of these new opportunities over the next few years. And the third point that I would make as well, is by having these teams working together and really creating centers of excellence, we find that to be an attribute in recruiting, and recruiting is an important part of our company, and I know sometimes it's a little bit of an odd message for folks that -- who we think about our industry right now as perhaps shedding jobs and reducing footprint. But even though we're down about 20% in headcount from our peak, we hired about 5,000 people last year, and we're going to do about the same this year. So recruiting is a big part of our thought process as we think about how we architect our infrastructure and our capabilities to enable us to continue to support technological superiority and deliver capabilities for our customers. So it's a sort of a multidimensional answer to your question, but the -- all the rationale pointed in the same direction that now is the time to take the step and invest in our own future.
Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: As we look at your financials the next 2 or 3 years, where are we going to see this first? I guess that's -- is it moving work and more increased efficiency and productivity and higher margins? Or is it an uptick sale somewhere, where maybe we're not expecting it?
James F. Palmer: Joe, I would say it's going to be a combination of improved efficiency to sustain margins, and the potential for higher sales as the new program opportunities materialize.
Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. I just had one quick one for you Jim, also, the EPS guidance went up. It may be up a little less than one might think, since you raised your margin guidance and also had the tax benefit that wasn't fully incorporated. Were there any offsets, or is this just a Q1 conservatism?
James F. Palmer: No, actually, the guidance raise essentially is about half tax rate and half guidance. When I looked at our raise in guidance, in terms of segment operating margin rates, roughly 10 basis points or so, that's about $0.07 to $0.08, $0.09, dependent from up where you are, and the tax rate is about another similar amount. So essentially, that's the adjustment to guidance.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Crédit Suisse.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: A couple of different questions here. Just first, Jim, a clarification, because it didn't get caught in the transcript here. On the mortality comment you made earlier in your opening remarks, did you say there was no impact or did you not quantify it? I can't quite tell.
James F. Palmer: Well, what I said is this mortality discussion has been ongoing for a while. We do expect that we should see some updates to mortality assumptions later this year. If that occurs, it will be in effect for year-end measurement of projected benefit obligations, which then affect 2015 expense.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Right, yes, next year.
James F. Palmer: You can guess a range of what that may mean, because obviously all of us are trying to understand what will be the updates to mortality assumptions, whether or not or how directly they apply to our circumstances. So frankly we're going to have to have a little bit more information and a little bit more time to study what it means.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay, I think the expectation and maybe incorrect, was that given that one of your peers actually threw a number out there, which was probably subject to change once things are finalized, you're just not in a position to that.
James F. Palmer: Well I think we can all speculate on what it may mean. But I think as I said, I think that it's, in all confidence, I can say that over the long term, projected benefit obligations will increase, that FAS and CAS expense will likely increase. And dependent upon the funding status of your plans, funding may be impacted as well. The exact timing, exact timing and in exact amounts at this point, are a little bit of an unknown.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Unknown, okay. Two more. This one, Wes, is for you, and it's a little bit of a budget discussion again and on M&A, but you talked about the differences in fidelity, perhaps, between Budget Authority and outlays. And given that sequestered budget authority in '16 would seem to be about flattish with Ryan Murray, Budget Authority for '15, is it fair to say that on the domestic business, you have really reached a trough, or you can at least see it, and what should that invite perhaps earlier M&A activity now that visibility's improved a bit?
Wesley G. Bush: I would continue to say that visibility has improved for '14 and '15, projecting the political dynamics between now and the appropriation cycle in '16. It's not something I would want to be speculating on. And if you just turn the clock back, that amount of time, instead of looking forward, turn it back that amount of time backwards, and try and predict exactly where we would have been today, given where we stood then, you would have been wrong. So I think we're going to have to see how this plays out. And I am concerned about it, as I said in my earlier remarks, and as I know our customers are concerned about it. Anytime we're in a place where the President, despite all of the challenge that we all recognize, we're facing from a total budgetary authority perspective, the President, in putting forward a budget, has to be as clear as I think the clarity was provided in this round that the current budget at sequester level just doesn't do it for national security. But you have to see the pushback that initially came off of the Hill on that, to me is a very strong signal that we've got a lot of political dynamics still in front of us. Where it actually lands, we're going to have to see.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: So is this to some extent because of your exposure to the programs they've already talked about, if sequester comes through in '16?
Wesley G. Bush: It's not. My commentary is not so much about our particular company's situation on this. I'm speaking more broadly about the investment accounts and the O&M accounts that our industry relies on, and as a source of domestic revenue, and related to that obviously, what it means for core structure and the rest of it. So those are all things that are bound up together, the set of decisions that translate from the total budget levels into what actually gets invested in equipment, in maintenance and the rest of it. There's a lot that goes on in the world between now and 2016.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And just lastly on margins, and this is really for either of you. But you've done a great job, and many in the space have, in terms of getting ahead of revenue declines with your costs. And certainly, I think this translates well in the short-cycle contracts. On the long-cycle side, where would we be, in terms of repricing to the new cost structure, in terms of how much turnover have you seen where you've already re-upped the contracts or signed new contracts that have pricing that reflects your new cost structure, and how much is left to do?
James F. Palmer: Rob, you can pretty simply do the math, frankly. If you look at the run rate of revenues in each of the sectors versus the backlog, and that kind of tells you how much of...
Wesley G. Bush: Term.
James F. Palmer: Yes, the term is. Obviously, aerospace is a little bit longer than the others, and IS is a little -- it is shorter than the long-cycle business. It essentially goes with the comments that we've been making all along about the longer-cycle businesses and the shorter-cycle businesses.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Yes, but then there's the other, the contract nuance that's not easily detected from outside.
James F. Palmer: I was just going to say that, that is the nature of this business, is continually repricing contracts every year when new contracts come up, and continuing to manage cost on a, day in, day out basis. That is the business.
Wesley G. Bush: The thing, too, I would add is, be careful about a static kind of approach to thinking about the cost equation. Yes, we and others in our industry have made some good progress on managing cost and doing what I would describe as sort of a tough blocking and tackling approach on headcount and infrastructure and that sort of thing. No one should assume that the game is up on cost management. That's a constant focus, certainly in our company and I think even more broadly than our company. And as we look at all of the levers involved in that, whether it's technology or architecture or the other elements of affordability, and we all have to continue to be on the cost agenda, if you will. So it is not sort of a static model where you can say, okay, we've taken cost out now, all go-forward contracts no longer get any benefit of future cost reduction. If that were be the model, we'd be in trouble.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Godyn with Morgan Stanley.
John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: I wanted to follow up on 2 topics from earlier in the call. First, on international sales and the growth opportunity there. I was hoping that you could just elaborate on how to map that to some of the segments, to the extent that Aerospace and Electronic Systems maybe have greater exposure to it than some of the other segments? And the second topic, just to follow up on the last question that was asked. I'm curious, with the improvements in cost and productivity, and you've certainly been differentiated in that right as well as the well-positioned pension, have you found that to actually lead to any competitive wins? Or an ability to kind of position yourself as a lower cost provider and turn it into maybe a little bit of a better revenue trend?
Wesley G. Bush: So on international, the breakout that I would see, if you're trying to map it to sectors, clearly, Electronics has our biggest footprint internationally, has done so for many years, run, sort of in place on the range, 20%, 25% of its sales, as international, and sees continued, very meaningful opportunities around the globe, ranging from upgrades to radar systems to new sensor suites to both the airborne side, the ground-based side. And it is, I think, a very well-positioned and robust international business for our company. Aerospace Systems is a little bit more, if you will, of a new story. It's largely associated with the unmanned system capability, and as well as, I mentioned earlier, we do see some manned potential around the globe, in terms of our E-2D platform and potentially some others. So it is more of an emerging international business, has some footprint today in that regard that is I think rapidly growing. With respect to Information Systems, clearly, the awareness and understanding of the importance of Cybersecurity is growing around the globe, and we have a very important and well-established position here in the U.S. and we are exploring the options for continuing to grow that. IS has, for some time, participated, I would say, at a smaller level, but in a growing way, in the C4ISR domain for some international business. So those are really the pieces. Tech services, by the way, as well, does a fair amount of training and maintenance support around the globe, too. So those are good opportunities for us that I think we're going to just continue to push on and see the opportunity expand. Now with respect to your final question on cost, clearly, yes. And it's important that we continue to work on the cost structure. I would put it in the inverse manner, that if we weren't doing it, I'm sure we would be losing. So hard to attach individual wins to a particular cost structure but we know it's vital to the competitiveness of our business.
Stephen C. Movius: Glenn, I think we're out of time. So at this point in time, I'd like to turn the session over to Wes for final comments.
Wesley G. Bush: Okay thanks, Steve. As he said at the start the call, the first quarter really is a good start to the year to us, and I am just delighted that we were able to raise our EPS guidance, based on the performance that we've seen in the first quarter. So thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call today, and thank you for your continuing interest in our company.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect, and have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's Fourth Quarter 2013 Conference Call. My name is Derek, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Steve Movius, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Movius, please proceed.
Stephen C. Movius: Thanks, Derek, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's fourth quarter and year-end 2013 conference call. We provided supplemental information in the form of a PowerPoint presentation that you can access at www.northropgrumman.com. Before we start, please understand that matters discussed on today's call constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to safe harbor provisions of federal security laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which are detailed in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risk factors may cause actual company results to differ materially. Matters discussed on today's call may also include non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled in the supplemental PowerPoint presentation. On the call today are Wes Bush, our Chairman, CEO and President; and Jim Palmer, our CFO. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Wes.
Wesley G. Bush: Thanks, Steve. Hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us. As I look back on 2013, a year characterized by a great deal of uncertainty, it's gratifying to have achieved strong performance. We met or exceeded our guidance for every metric, and that's due to the hard work and dedication of our entire team. So I'm going to start our call today by congratulating our employees on a job well done in 2013. Our financial results for the year demonstrate the benefit of superior program performance. We continue to focus on reducing costs, innovating for affordability, meeting program commitments to our customers, shaping our portfolio and, of course, generating cash and deploying our cash to create long-term value. Our sectors continue to produce strong segment operating margin rates. Although we had slightly lower segment operating income, the benefit of our share repurchases more than helped offset the EPS impact. Full year diluted earnings per share rose 7%, and on a pension-adjusted basis, 2013 diluted earnings per share increased 5.5%. Cash generation was also strong. For the year, before the impact of pension prefunding, we generated cash from operations of $2.8 billion and free cash flow of $2.4 billion. On a reported basis, free cash flow of $2.1 billion represents a free cash flow yield of approximately 13% and net income conversion of 109%. In 2013, we used our cash to invest in our businesses, fund our pension plans, repurchase stock and pay dividends. Our capital spending increased by approximately $50 million in the fourth quarter, as we ramped up our investments in our Aerospace Systems Centers of Excellence. In addition, we made a $500 million discretionary pension contribution and we repurchased 27.3 million shares of our common stock for $2.4 billion. As of yearend, we repurchased 20.8 million shares toward our previously announced goal of retiring 60 million shares by the end of 2015, market conditions permitting. Share repurchases in 2013 reduced our weighted average diluted share count by approximately 8%. We also increased our quarterly dividend by 11% last year and paid shareholders dividends of $545 million. In 2013, we distributed nearly $3 billion of cash to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. This represents approximately 140% of reported free cash flow. Cash from the balance sheet was more than $5 billion at yearend, reflecting the $2 billion of net new debt we raised last year and substantial cash generated by our operations. So as I look at 2013 performance, I'm particularly proud of our results in the context of last year's challenging U.S. government budget environment. In contrast to the challenges in the U.S. market last year, we are seeing growth in our international business. In 2013, we grew our international sales by approximately 20% to $2.5 billion. International sales were slightly more than 10% of total revenue in 2013. Our Aerospace Systems and Electronic Systems sectors both posted higher sales for the year, and growth in international business was a significant contributor to top line growth for those sectors. At AS, the wrap up on NATO AGS contributed to their sales growth. And for ES, growth in their core portfolio of international offerings was a driver of their top line growth in 2013. We see emerging opportunities around the globe that our portfolio should allow us to address. In 2014, we expect international sales to increase to approximately 13% of total revenue. Beyond 2014, we see growing demand for our unmanned platforms, manned military aircraft, airborne surveillance, electronics, cyber, sustainment and other offerings. We captured new awards of $21.9 billion in 2013 for a book-to-bill of 89%, and we began 2014 with a total backlog of $37 billion. Awards in 2013 were impacted and in some cases moved to the right as a result of budget uncertainty and turmoil. Now that we have a budget, we and our customers can plan with more confidence compared to where we were at this time last year. We're still in a difficult and evolving budget environment, but we now have a 2014 appropriations bill that provides program direction. And importantly, the Bipartisan Budget Act passed in December set discretionary spending levels for both 2014 and 2015. We expect this will alleviate some budget cuts that would have occurred if sequestration had been triggered again. These actions reduced some of our customers' budgeting uncertainty and increased their ability to make strategic spending decisions. Overall, we're pleased with the 2014 budget outcomes for our programs, but it continues to be a challenging U.S. budget environment in terms of absolute dollars spent on national security. And we expect that we'll be continuing pressure on the investment accounts, especially for research and development. As our customers deal with these pressures, there is some uncertainty as to the program decisions they may make this year and in the future to conform their spending to these reduced budgets. The resolution of that near-term debt ceiling issue also poses some additional uncertainty. We understand the need for disciplined spending to address our nation's fiscal challenges. How we get there needs to be rational and supportive of maintaining our technological superiority and our national security. Our nation needs a balanced strategic approach to our fiscal challenges. We need to recognize that to assure our technological advantage over the longer term, our country must invest in the near term. Now turning to guidance for 2014, we expect sales to range between $23.5 billion and $23.8 billion, with earnings per share of $8.70 to $9, cash from operations of $2.3 billion to $2.6 billion and free cash flow of $1.7 billion to $2 billion. At the midpoint, our sales guidance implies a top line decline of approximately $1 billion or 4%. Jim will provide more detail, but more than half of the change reflects continued pressure in our short-cycle businesses: Information Systems and Technical Services. The remainder of the variance reflects our expectations for lower volume in some programs in Aerospace Systems and Electronic Systems, somewhat offset by our growing international sales in these sectors. But considering all of these factors together, I see 2014 as another year of good opportunities for our company with continued strong cash generation and cash deployment to create value. Our guidance contemplates continued share repurchases that support our goal of retiring 60 million shares by the end of 2015. In conclusion, our 2013 results demonstrate strong performance in a challenging environment, and our priorities remain the same in 2014: driving performance, effectively deploying our cash and optimizing our portfolio for the future. Our record these past few years demonstrates that we can do this successfully, and I'm delighted to be working with our company's talented team to create long-term sustained value. So now I'll turn the call over to Jim for a more detailed discussion of results and guidance. Jim?
James F. Palmer: Thanks, Wes, and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I also want to add my congratulations to our team on their outstanding work this past year. We performed very well in a tough, challenging and uncertain environment and, importantly, sustained the performance improvements we generated in 2012. Our teams' efforts led to another excellent year for our company. So let me spend a few minutes and review those results. Segment operating margin rate was 12.5% in 2013 versus 12.6% in 2012. On a year-over-year basis, net favorable adjustments declined by $232 million. This decline was partially offset by higher contract margin rates, resulting from several factors, including the continuing effect of prior net favorable adjustments across our portfolio of contracts. Total operating margin rate for the year improved 30 basis points, primarily due to a $49 million decrease in corporate and unallocated expenses and an improvement in our net FAS/CAS pension adjustment. Corporate unallocated expenses improved due to lower provisions for disallowed cost and litigation matters as well as the favorable settlement of overhead claims, partially offset by changes in state deferred tax assets. On a pension-adjusted basis, our operating margin rate increased to 12%, a new record for the company. As Wes mentioned, 2013 cash generation was outstanding and a real performance highlight. Before the impact of our voluntary pension pre-funding, cash from operations totaled $2.8 billion, which is comparable to 2012. Free cash flow before pension contributions totaled $2.4 billion and more than $10 per share. During 2013, we distributed approximately $3 billion to our shareholders or more than $12 per share. Based on the average daily share price during 2013, our cash distribution yield per share was approximately 14%. And in addition to the cash distribution yield, our share price increased 70%. So it really was an exceptional year for the company and for our shareholders. Let me spend a few minutes now and talk about 2013 sector results and provide some thoughts on 2014 guidance for each of the businesses. Aerospace Systems fourth quarter sales declined by 7%. You might remember that AS had a particularly strong fourth quarter in 2012, so this was a difficult comparison. Aerospace Systems fourth quarter margin rate declined to 11.5% from 13.8% last year. And again, you may recall that 2012 had an unusually high fourth quarter margin rate that benefited from a couple of large positive adjustments in space programs. For the year, AS sales totaled $10 billion, slightly higher than in 2012 and margin rate of 12.1% in 2013 is comparable to the prior year. For 2014, we expect AS sales to range from $9.7 billion and $9.9 billion with a margin rate in the mid to high 11% range. The expected sales volume reflect lower volumes for our programs like Global Hawk, Fire Scout, E-2 and the James Webb Space Telescope, partially offset by expectations for higher volume from NATO AGS and the E-2D. Electronic Systems also had outstanding results this year. Fourth quarter sales increased 6% due to higher volume for space programs, international and combat avionics, and fourth quarter margin rate declined due to somewhat lower net favorable adjustments. And for the year, ES sales increased 3%, reflecting volume in space and international programs, while maintaining a robust 17.1% margin rate. For 2014, we expect ES revenues will range between $6.8 billion and $7 billion, and top line guidance for ES contemplates slightly lower volume due to some continued impact from force reductions in overseas contingency operations and lower revenues for some radar programs, partially offset by higher international sales. We expect ES operating margin rate in the low- to mid-15% range for 2014. And although lower than 2013, I think it's still very healthy and indicative of continued strong execution at ES. Information Systems; sales declined by 14% in the fourth quarter and 10% for the year. Declines in both periods reflect lower funding levels, including the impact of sequestration and government shutdown and lower volume due to in-theater force reductions as well as some contract completions. In addition for 2013, the transfer of intercompany sales by our shared services organization reduced sales by almost $100 million. And excluding the transfer, sales would have declined by 9%. ES maintained a strong 9.9% operating margin rate in the fourth quarter. And for the year, margin rate was 9.6%, which is about 70 basis points lower than last year, largely due to a $73 million decrease in net favorable adjustments. For 2014, we expect IS sales will range between $6.1 billion and $6.2 billion, a decline of about 7% due to the continued in-theater force reductions, wind down of several programs and lower funding across a number of our contracts. We expect IS to maintain a strong mid-9% operating margin rate in 2014. Moving to Technical Services, fourth quarter and 2013 sales both declined by 6%. Trends in both periods reflect lower volume for integrated logistics and modernization programs at the KC-10 as well as the ICBM program restructuring. Operating income for both the fourth quarter and the year reflect lower sales, partially offset by improved performance. Operating margin rate expanded by 40 basis points in the fourth quarter and 30 basis points for the year. High margin rates for both periods reflect improved performance across several programs. For 2014, we expect TS sales of approximate $2.7 billion, a decline of about 5% reflecting lower funding and in-theater force reductions as well as some lower volume for the ICBM program. For margin rates, we expect a high 8% margin rate for TS in 2014. So on a consolidated basis, we expect 2014 segment operating margin rate will be in the high 11% range. Turning to pension items, our 2013 planned asset investment returns were slightly more than 8%. So on a GAAP basis, our funded status of our plans increased to 93% at the end of 2013 from 83% at the end of 2012. Due to higher interest rates, the discount rate has increased to 4.99% from 4.12% at the beginning of the year, and we are maintaining our 8% long-term rate of return expectation as well. So based on those assumptions, we expect 2014 FAS expense of approximately $115 million, a decline of about $260 million from 2013. And we expect our CAS recovery to be approximately $555 million, which was an amount comparable to 2013. I should point out that, that CAS amount could move up or down by about $40 million, dependent upon actual participant demographics, and we would expect to know those results in the third quarter of 2014. At this point, we expect our net FAS pension adjustment will be income of approximately $440 million or an improvement of $272 million from 2013. We expect 2014 corporate unallocated expenses to return to a more normal level in the range of, let's say, $150 million to $200 million compared to $119 million in 2013. And as I pointed out, 2013 included some nonrecurring items that reduced corporate unallocated expenses that we don't expect to repeat in 2014. When we consider all of that, we would expect total operating margin rate in the high 12% in 2014. For interest expense, we expect interest expense of approximately $285 million, up from $257 million in 2013, with the additional interest expense reflecting a higher debt level for the full year of 2014. We expect a tax rate of about 32% to 32.5% in '14 versus the 31.8% in 2013. And as I know you all know, that 2013 tax rate included a benefit, actually, for 2 years of R&D tax credits of $37 million, and our 2014 expected effective tax rate does not include an R&D tax credit, which, at this point, has expired, but it does include the benefit of the expected resolution of the IRS exams for the tax years 2007 through 2009. And our 2014 earnings per share guidance of $8.70 to $9 contemplates a 8% reduction in weighted average shares outstanding to approximately 215 million shares, which is, again, a reduction similar to what we saw in 2013. We expect cash from operations of $2.3 billion to $2.6 billion and free cash flow of $1.7 billion to $2 billion. The cash guidance does include the benefit of 2014's lower pension contributions net of income taxes, which is essentially offset by lower segment operating margin. The other major variable is working capital, which has the potential to be plus or minus $100 million. At this point, due to the strong funded status of our pension plans, our required contributions in 2014 are only $74 million. Our free cash flow guidance does include a ramp-up in capital spending to about $600 million into 2014. I would expect that -- this level of capital spending to continue for the next couple of years. At the same time, I expect the required cash contributions -- cash pension contributions in 2015 and 2016 will also remain low, likely less than $100 million, while CAS pension recoveries are also likely to increase. So in summary, our guidance contemplates solid operating performance and strong cash generation in 2014. Barring any major disruption to any of our major programs, we expect this type of performance to continue beyond 2014, which will allow us to make additional investments in our business, while continuing to execute a balanced cash deployment strategy that returns a substantial amount of cash to our shareholders. So, Steve, with that introduction, I think we're ready for Q&A.
Stephen C. Movius: Thanks, Jim. [Operator Instructions] And with that, Derek, we are ready to begin the Q&A session.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will be from the line of Finbar Sheehy, Sanford Bernstein.
Finbar T. Sheehy - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: You had a pretty impressive run on the share price this past year, and you talked about reducing share count, distributing cash that way to shareholders. So I'm just wondering if there's a point which the share price would give you pause, or [ph] how you think about balancing cash to share repurchases to other uses if the share price moves up.
James F. Palmer: Well, we did talk and have talked for quite a while about a balanced cash deployment strategy, investing in our business, managing the balance sheet, competitive dividend and returning excess cash to shareholders. We do take a long-term view of the company, its portfolio, the strength of the portfolio, the cash generation capability of our company, and all those factors go into our thoughts around our share repurchase program. So I think that pretty well sums up our thinking. It really has not changed from where we've been over the last number of years. As I tried to say in my summary comments, barring any major program changes, I would expect the performance that we've had in '13 to continue into '14 and likely beyond.
Finbar T. Sheehy - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: So yes, you don't have a sort of price where you think about...
James F. Palmer: We make decisions, essentially, every day around our repurchase program. We tend to approach our repurchase program with a 10b5-1 program that we put in place for a period of time based on a grid that does vary the amount of purchases based on share price. Now we look at that grid on a regular basis whenever we put a new program in place.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Jason Gursky, Citi.
Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Jim, I was wondering if you could maybe just walk us through the various puts and takes in guidance, and what would cause you to reach both the bottom end of guidance and the top end, just kind of where the risks lie as we move through the years so we can kind of track things.
James F. Palmer: Well, as I thought about the guidance range and, essentially, the sector operating margins, probably the biggest variable is both AS and ES, our largest segments, those would be probably the largest variables. And really, it's going to come down to individual program performance. Largely, in those 2 sectors, I would think, would be the major variables. I don't know that we're going to have a lot of movement around necessarily the other 2 sectors. And tax rate probably has a little variance around it and corporate allocations. Unallocated costs always have some variance to it. And then frankly, the other variable would be weighted average shares per year.
Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. I don't want to put words in your mouth, but it sounded to me from kind of pure operations perspective is just execution on both [ph] the programs that are already in the contract, that there's no reliance on the budget that's coming up and new signings to get things to where you need to be for the year?
James F. Palmer: Yes. Our business, much of it comes from the backlog in the current year. A little bit less so at IS, but for the 2 other longer-cycle businesses, much of it has come from the backlog. The other variable, frankly, would be individual program decisions that may be made during the year that, obviously, if we had a termination of a program, of a major program, unexpected at this point of time, that could be a variable as well.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Joe Nadol, JPMorgan.
Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: So, Wes, when we look at backlog and bookings, the funded backlog was down 12%. The overall backlog, I guess, including unfunded, was down 9%. Your sales guidance is, middle of the range, down 4% for 2014. So I guess, it's a single 1-part question, but really with a couple of components. Can you offer a bookings guidance for the year to give us some sense if you expect backlog to come back a little bit at some point? And if not, when does that decline in backlog start accelerating your sales declines?
Wesley G. Bush: Each year, we think hard about what's in front of us in terms of the competitive environment and what our customers may or may not do. In my remarks earlier, I noted that we saw in 2013 just a general perspective in many parts of our customer community that made it difficult for them to pursue the awarding of new contracts as aggressively as I think many of them would have wanted to. And we saw some things move to the right. We may see some more of that this year. Clearly, the investment accounts continue to be under some pressure in '14 and I think in '15 as well, as the department wrestles to the ground what it's actually going to do with the appropriated amounts that are out there. And we all know it takes a little bit longer to deal with force structure and investments become a little bit more the variable as we get through that. So how do we look at '14 in that regard? I think there's going to be real pressure in the investment accounts this year just as there was last year. I think we'll gain a little bit more insight into that as we get the president's budget and can see with a little bit more clarity how the department is sorting through the profile that's going to be using to navigate through '14 and '15 as it looks forward to '16. But getting out in front of that right now, I think, would be a little bit premature. Clearly, we always want to push for a good book-to-bill, but the message that we've given the team, and I think it's important for everyone to understand, is we're looking at quality in the business not just quantity. We want to make sure that we're doing things in a way that's going to ensure that we can continue to grow our value. So that's the domestic side. The other part that I commented on in my remarks was international. We expect to see that continuing to grow this year, and there are some opportunities there that would add to the backlog as well. So we're looking at it comprehensively, and I think that's probably about the breadth of the remark I can make on book-to-bill at this point.
Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. I mean, we do have a 2014 budget at this point. It's 2015 that we're waiting for. I know, of course, it's very important, but most of your bookings this year would come out of '13 and '14 anyway domestically. So at...
Wesley G. Bush: Yes. What I was referring to there is when the 2015 president's budget gets put on the table I think we'll have a better insight into potential award profiles over the next few years. And since your question related to book-to-bill and not so much sales, that award profile really drives more the book-to-bill perspective.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Carter Copeland, Barclays.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division: At the risk of being extra boring, I'm going to ask you, Jim, about a topic so near and dear to your heart, and that's pension. I know you like it so much, so I wondered if you might be able to help us step through what the FAS/CAS adjustment would be with no changes in assumptions if you were to look out to 2015 and 2016?
James F. Palmer: Well, you're really asking me to get my crystal ball out, aren't you?
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division: No, no change to assumptions, no crystal ball. We'll pretend nothing ever moves.
James F. Palmer: And we all know that's really the case.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division: A great assumption, I know.
James F. Palmer: Yes. But to answer your question, if I were to look ahead for the next couple years with no change in assumptions, I probably would see net FAS/CAS moving up about in the range of 200 to 225 each year '15 and '16, which essentially means that FAS is going to hold about constant where it is and CAS will move up by about that amount each year as we look through time. As you probably know, a big part of that is due to CAS harmonization. And as we go through time, that CAS harmonization does phase in. And by the end of 4 years, it's completely phased in. But CAS harmonization is essentially much more of a settlement concept, meaning heavily dependent upon interest rates, and so to the extent that interest rates do fluctuate over a period of time, that could drive a rather significant change in those assumptions around CAS, particularly in the latter years.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Sam Pearlstein, Wells Fargo.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: If I use some of the numbers, what you've put in terms of percentage of sales of international, it would seem like you're going to get another 20-plus percent kind of growth this year. So I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what's driving that growth, and somewhat related, what competitions we should be watching to unfold this year.
Wesley G. Bush: There are several things sort of across the board driving growth. Clearly, our electronics business has historically been our strongest performing internationally, and they continue to do very well in that regard. And in terms of the breadth of their footprint and the breadth of their offerings, I think we're just going to continue to see electronics have a number of broad opportunities scattered around the globe, quite frankly. The area, though, that's perhaps new in our story with respect to international is unmanned, and we've started that process with the capture of NATO AGS. And that program continues to go well and it was kind of moving up its curve, if you will, in terms of the volume it represents for Aerospace Systems. Over the course of this year, an important one to watch, of course, will be Global Hawk for Korea. And it's -- it, too, is I think a very important milestone, both in terms of the program itself, but also in terms of what it represents for exportability of this class of capability to our allies around the globe. So that's an area that, from my perspective, is one that's going to be important as we look to the future. Now our other businesses, IS and TS, also have international opportunities that range from the work that we're doing in C4ISR to Cyber to sustainment. So it's a fairly broad-based activity that we're seeing in terms of the international opportunity space in front of us. And we're, of course, thoughtful and we want to make sure that each of the steps that we take on an international basis is aligned with what our allies really need and what our customer community can support. But I will tell you that we've been seeing an increasing focus within the DoD to help make sure that our allies are able to access the capabilities that they need to both be interoperable as well as to be a bigger part of the overall global security equation. And so I'm cautiously optimistic that, that trend will continue and that we'll continue to see this expansion of footprint opportunities.
Operator: Your next question is from Myles Walton, Deutsche Bank.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: I just want to clarify one thing. I may have misheard it. But the CapEx number for '14 and go forward of $600 million? I'm just not sure I got that right. I haven't seen you guys do that since you owned a shipbuilder.
James F. Palmer: Well, we are looking at around $600 million in '14. And I do think the CapEx will stay -- I don't know if it's going to be at $600 million in '15 or so, but it's going to be higher than it's been over the last couple of years. You might remember in the first part of 2013, actually first quarter, we announced Aerospace Systems Centers of Excellence, moving some businesses down in there and expanding our operations down in Florida. So we're adding to capabilities down there and we're going to be building that out over the next 1.5 years for sure, maybe even a little bit longer.
Wesley G. Bush: And, Myles, it's Wes. I would just say that from a broader perspective, that Centers of Excellence approach does a number of things for us. It helps us, over the longer term, on our affordability, which I think is a critical part of our competitiveness. It also helps us in terms of better managing our human capital base and being able to concentrate our activities in a more integrated manner and take maximum advantage of the skill sets that we have. So this is an important part of our longer-term strategy, and from our perspective, investing in our business makes a lot more sense.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Got it, okay. And the real question was on the favorable adjustment. It sounds like they were down $230 million, so the underlying margins were quite strong, even with that decline. And so I'm curious, what kind of profile you've built in or baked in for '14 versus '13 in the high 11s in the segment margins.
James F. Palmer: Our margin guidance, Myles, is based really on our expectation for the overall margins in each of the businesses as opposed to any [ph] expectation, if you will, around individual team catch-up adjustments. As you know, we've looked at our businesses and our competitors' businesses that are similar to ours and how they view of what the benchmark margin rates ought to be for each of those businesses, and we're [ph] driving our organization to perform at the top end of those ranges. So it's really based much more on expectations, what the business ought to do. Clearly, we have an understanding of margins in our backlog, and all of those become factors in our thinking about margin rate guidance for the year.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Ron Epstein, Bank of America.
Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Just wanted to ask a big picture question. When we think about maybe 2 things, so one on the financial side. When you complete the current buyback plan, you will have, I think, bought back about half the company, incrementally, over the last 8 years approximately. Why not just buy it all back at once? Why chase the stock higher? You know what I mean? I mean, why not take the company private? I mean, have you thought about it? Any thoughts you have on that?
Wesley G. Bush: Yes. It's Wes. Let me give you kind of a broader view. Yes, when we think about capital deployment and the approach that we think that makes the most sense, we often use the term balanced approach because we want to be investing in our business. We want to obviously take care of our pension plan as we go along, which we've been very good stewards of doing over the last number of years, as well as returning cash to shareholders. And ultimately, when we think about that overall longer-term perspective, the path that we've been on for a number of years is what has made the most sene to us. And as we've talked about our outlook for this year, we've been pretty clear that, that path continues to make the most sense to us. We go through, as every company does, a periodic review of our full range of alternatives. And as we do that, we think about what really does make the most sense for our shareholders over the longer term as well, and that has led us to the conclusion that it has put us on the path that we're on, and we continue to see that as a very, very good path. And as we indicated in our remarks, we remain focused on our goal of retiring the shares that we've outlined through the end of 2015. Trying to project where we'll be beyond the end of 2015 at this point would be, I think, a little bit too speculative. But to answer your question directly, we do think about that broad range of alternatives. And as a conclusion of that thinking, we're doing what we're doing.
Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And then maybe just jumping over and out to more program-specific stuff. How should we think about the transition in the airplane business as we see probably F-18s start ramping down and F-35s ramp up? Is there -- how do you view the margin exchange there? I mean, is there some margin headwind? How do they offset each other?
James F. Palmer: Well, clearly, F-18 is a mature production program. We're not quite there yet on F-35. So as we transition, there may be a little bit of an impact there. But frankly, our aerospace sector is much broader than F-18s and F-35s. E-2D is an important part of that portfolio. The space part is there, equally important part, as well as the unmanned portion of the portfolio. All factors, all factor into the overall margin rates at Aerospace Systems. Again, when we look at our competitors in that business, the margins that we've been generating, I think, are really strong margins for the type of business we're in. And we'll continue to manage that business as best we really can.
Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay, great. And maybe just one last one. On the investment side again, when we think about -- and there's been some of this in the press and I realize you're limited what you can say. But on this next-generation bomber program, given you guys teamed up against a formidable other team, will we expect a ramp up of kind of internal R&D money on that given the importance of that program potentially to the company in the future?
Wesley G. Bush: Ron, it's Wes. I think all I can say there is that clearly we have a strong legacy in the business of providing bombers to the United States Air Force. We're proud of that history and our capability in that regard. And I think our shareholders should count on us to do the things that we think are appropriate to continue to position our company for the long term there. I think that's about all I can say on it.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research.
George Shapiro: Jim, as I take a look at your margin guidance for this year, my question is, is this just the typical conservatism that you put in early in the year? Or is this really the beginning of a trend to get back to some of those normalized margins that you brought up I don't know how many years ago for which you've been way over-earning?
James F. Palmer: George, George, George. We look at our business every year based on -- as I said, we know what's in our backlog. We have expectations what the business ought to be able to generate. Frankly, if I look at guidance for each of our businesses versus performance over the last couple of years, other than ES, the guidance is very close to what they actually have been performing at over the last couple of years. ES, on the other hand, had just an outstanding 2012 and 2013. And again, when I look at a competitive situation, those kind of margin rates on a long-term basis in that business, I just don't know that we can maintain them over that long time -- long-term period. Low- to mid-15s is really strong margins for our business. And so I'm very comfortable with our guidance for this year. There's always a possibility of changes as we go through the year, as we see actual performance. So could they do better? History would say they probably could. I look further back, history would say they could probably be a little bit worse. So on balance, I think, again, it reflects our best judgment at this point in time, of where we think each of these businesses are going to be able to perform for the year.
George Shapiro: Okay. And let me just ask for Wes your comment on the Jammer contract that Raytheon won. Do you have any color you might share?
Wesley G. Bush: No, nothing beyond I think what we talked about in the past. We take each of these competitions and approach them as we think is the right approach for our ability to offer and our customers' ability to offer. And when we don't win, we take that very seriously and go back and scrub and try and learn our best lessons from it. But I don't -- other than as I said what we've communicated on that in the past, I don't think we have any new perspective. It continues to be an important business area for us. The whole EW field is one that I think is going to continue to grow. So nothing about that particular outcome causes us to reevaluate being in this business. If anything, it causes us to just learn some lessons and redouble our efforts here. We think that's a very important business area.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss, UBS.
David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: I just want to come at this margin question in a little bit different way. Wes, I guess the guidance for lower margins, does it speak to anything around the cost reduction opportunity that you see in the company today relative to what you've been able to do over the last couple of years relative to headcount? Or maybe at this point, some of those savings actually starting to find their way back to DoD as contracts reprice?
Wesley G. Bush: Your perspective is correct. We're in a business where the results of our cost reduction activities ultimately go back to our customer over time as we go into new contracts, and that's good. I mean that's as an important part of the way our industry works. It helps us to drive affordability for our customer community during a period of time when, obviously, their budgets are under a lot more pressure. But at the same time, when we're talking about profitability, part of the challenge and opportunity that we have is to continue to figure out how to do things at an inherently lower cost, use some of the innovative capacity in our enterprise to do that, so that we do have the opportunity to continue to make a good profit on what we're doing. So there's always a balance point in this. I would say our guidance obviously reflects where we think we are in our full set of contracts from a total cost perspective and affordability perspective. But let me also be clear that we're going to continue to drive affordability. Yes, we have taken a lot of actions over the last few years to enhance our competitiveness and to reduce cost, both in headcount and in footprint, as well as in a broad variety of efficiencies in our enterprise. You're never done at working on cost, and we're going to stay at that. It continues to be an opportunity in front of us. But clearly, as we think about guidance on margin rates, we factor in that aspect, the aspect of how we price on new contracts, as well as, obviously, what Jim said, our broader view of how these businesses should perform.
David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. That's helpful. In terms of a follow-up, on the international side, with that ramping up as a percentage of the overall business, is that -- I would assume it's additive to the margin profile. And then would you expect some of that work to bring -- to benefit you on the advancement side of things?
Wesley G. Bush: On international, yes, generally, our margin rates in international are a bit more attractive than the domestic business, not universally, but overall. In aggregate, they are. And depending on the type of contract, whether it's FMS or if it's a sale, in some cases, yes, that can help on advances. But each and every one of these is a negotiation. So we deal with them sort of one at a time as opposed to in aggregate.
Operator: At this time, I'm showing no further questions the queue. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Wes Bush for any closing remarks.
Wesley G. Bush: Thanks, Eric. I just would say thanks, everyone, for continuing to be interested in our company. As I said in my earlier remarks, we're very pleased with the outcome for 2013, given the challenges of the environment in which we operated. It is a reflection of the hard work and dedication of the team across our company. And I think, quite frankly, it's also a reflection given how difficult last year was in our customer community. It's a reflection of the partnership that we have with our customers. They went through some pretty tough times last year. And I think as a nation, we should all recognize and respect what our customer communities had to deal with in navigating through 2013. We all feel a little bit better about where we are from a budget perspective in 2014, having an appropriations process that's back closer to normal. We hope that continues. We hope that we can get back to regular order on a more regular basis and see this as the path that will allow our customer community and our industry to plan and to do the things that are necessary to ensure our national security. So thanks, everyone. Appreciate your continuing interest and look forward to the opportunity to interact with many of you over the coming months as we prepare and launch into 2014.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Northrop Grumman Third Quarter 2013 Conference Call. My name is Frances, and I will be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Steve Movius, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Movius, please proceed.
Stephen C. Movius: Thanks, Frances, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's Third Quarter 2013 Conference Call. Before we start, please understand the matters discussed on today's call constitute forward-looking statements, pursuant to Safe Harbor provisions of federal security laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which are detailed in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risk factors may cause actual company results to differ materially. On the call today are Wes Bush, our Chairman, CEO and President; and Jim Palmer, our CFO. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Wes.
Wesley G. Bush: Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Once again, our results were strong and reflect the hard work and dedication of the entire Northrop Grumman team. I want to start our call today by acknowledging our employees' unwavering dedication in maintaining top performance in support of our critical global security missions, especially in challenging times. As a company, we're always mindful that our products and services are of critical importance to our nation and to our allies. Today's budget issues are creating real challenges for both our industry and our government customers, compounding our nation's difficulty in addressing the modern global threat environment. I am very proud of the hard work by our employees and by our government partners, who remain focused and committed to the mission we serve. As we've said in prior quarters, our strategy is focused on performance, effective cash deployment and a portfolio aligned with our customers' priority investment areas. All 3 elements continue to be major value drivers for our shareholders, customers and employees. We are focused on delivering affordable and innovative products and services for our customers and solid financial returns for our shareholders. While declining defense budgets continue to pressure our top line and backlog, the substantial reductions we've made to our cost structure, including headcount reductions, facility consolidations and numerous other affordability actions, continue to support strong earnings and cash flow performance. And you can see this in our third quarter results. Despite a 3% sales decline, third quarter EPS grew 18%. Performance and effective cash deployment were primary drivers of the improvement. Third quarter results include a 90 basis point improvement in our segment operating margin rate, the result of strong operating income and margin rates at all 4 of our businesses. As expected, our shorter-cycle businesses, Information Systems and Technical Services, continue to experience more substantial top line declines as a result of the budget environment. Despite lower sales, both sectors continue to deliver solid operating income and strong operating margin rates. Our cash performance is also strong and we continue to return cash to shareholders. During the quarter, cash from operations totaled $950 million and free cash flow totaled $860 million. Year-to-date, before discretionary pension contributions, we have generated $1.6 billion in cash from operations and free cash flow of $1.5 billion. During the quarter, we used $753 million to repurchase 8.1 million shares of our stock. And year-to-date, we've repurchased 20.6 million shares for $1.7 billion. Including more than $400 million in dividends paid year-to-date, we've returned more than $2 billion in cash to shareholders this year, substantially more than our year-to-date free cash flow. In addition to deploying cash through share repurchases and dividends, we are increasing capital investments to ensure long-term competitiveness, affordability and innovation. Third quarter capital expenditures increased, principally due to investments for the construction of our 2 new manned military aircraft centers of excellence in Florida. Capital spending will also increase in the fourth quarter and into 2014, as our investment in these centers of excellence ramps up. We ended the quarter with a total backlog of $37.5 billion, which reflects new awards of $5.9 billion, a 97% book-to-bill ratio. Through the end of the third quarter, we captured $16.2 billion in new awards for a book-to-bill of 88%. These include significant awards for the F-35, Advanced EHF satellites, the B-2, the E-2D Advanced Hawkeye and Global Hawk. And during the quarter, our SABR radar won the competition to upgrade U.S. and Taiwanese F-16 with the next-generation AESA radar. This program is a key strategic win for us and will provide F-16s unprecedented operational capability and greater reliability. Based on our year-to-date results, we are increasing guidance for 2013 sales, earnings per share and cash flow. We now expect sales of approximately $24.4 billion and we expect EPS to range between $8 and $8.15. Cash from operations is now expected to range between $2.3 billion and $2.6 billion with free cash flow of $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion. Guidance for both those metrics, those cash metrics, is before discretionary pension contributions. As we said last quarter, we will provide 2014 guidance on our year-end conference call. But we wanted to give you some idea of how we are thinking about 2014. As you are aware, after beginning fiscal year 2014 with a partial government shutdown, we now have a continuing resolution through January 15. And the debt ceiling has been raised through February 7. We don't know whether we will have a formal 2014 budget, or like last year, it's possible that we may be in an operating condition under a continuing resolution for some extended period of time. In addition, another round of sequestration is scheduled to be triggered in January. These next couple of months are an important time for our Congress to address the budget uncertainties that have been created by the sequester and the breakdown of the appropriations process. As the senior leadership of the DoD has said many times, the current environment is not supportive of planning and managing the institutions in our government that ensure our national security. The inability of Congress to agree on a budget poses real problems for the long term. And the sequester is clearly impacting national security already. But it's also having impacts on other elements of our society, such as reducing the research and development that underpins our future economy and negatively impacting education at all levels in our country. We need to return to a functional appropriations process in managing our country's affairs. And ending the sequester should be a first step in that direction. As we look ahead, considering the budget environment, we would expect lower sales in 2014. We expect our businesses to continue to perform well and generate strong margin rates. We also expect strong cash flows to continue. Our goal is to convert 100% of earnings into free cash flow. This is before any discretionary pension contributions. And we've been successful at achieving that over the last few years. The degree of top line decline will largely depend on budgeting decisions. As we saw this year, our shorter-cycle businesses have been more impacted by the budget turmoil. We would expect this to be the case next year as well. Conversely, we would expect our longer-cycle businesses to be less impacted. Obviously, today's budget environment creates uncertainty. But by focusing on the things we can control, performance and capital deployment, we expect to deliver solid 2014 results. This outlook assumes that our operations do not experience any significant disruptions as a result of major program cancellations or restructurings. While the budget environment continues to be dynamic, we are positioning Northrop Grumman for the long term. That means continuing to invest in a portfolio that is aligned with the enduring priority areas of investment for global security, unmanned, C4ISR, cyber and logistics and modernization, along with manned military aircraft. It also means achieving and sustaining a high level of financial and program performance and effectively deploying our substantial cash resources to create value. So with that, now I'll turn the call over to Jim for a more detailed discussion of our results and guidance. Jim?
James F. Palmer: Thanks, Wes, and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. My comments will focus on third quarter and year-to-date results and our updated 2013 guidance. As Wes said, just another solid quarter. Our team has proactively responded to the challenging budget environment to ensure that we continue to execute very well. I want to add my sincere appreciation for our team and the dedication and focus, particularly during the last several weeks. Major drivers, as Wes said, for the quarter were performance and share repurchases. We also benefited from a lower tax rate this quarter due to the benefits associated with our 2012 federal tax return and the R&D tax credit extension. And we had an improvement in our net FAS/CAS pension adjustment that reflects an update for actual demographic experience as of the beginning of the year. The tax benefit added $0.07 and the pension benefit added $0.09 to third quarter -- or $0.08 rather to third quarter earnings per share. So before the tax and pension benefits, EPS would have been $1.99 or about 9% higher than last year's third quarter. Higher corporate unallocated expenses, as well as interest expense, along with lower other income, were partial offsets to the tax and pension benefits. Turning to the sectors. Aerospace Systems had sales decline of 4%, primarily due to lower volume on the F-35 and Global Hawk programs. Excluding Global Hawk, our unmanned systems portfolio continues to experience revenue growth. While the Global Hawk program is mature, we continue to ramp up on other unmanned programs, including NATO AGS and Triton, to name just a couple. Space revenue also increased due to higher volume for AEHF and the James Webb Space Telescope programs. Those increases were partially offset by lower volume for our restricted space programs. AS operating income increased 15% and operating margin rate was substantially higher at 13.3%. During the quarter, AS had a $44 million increase and net favorable adjustments primarily for space and manned military aircraft programs, which more than offset the impact of lower sales. Based on year-to-date results, we continue to expect AS sales of about $9.9 billion in 2013 with a margin rate of approximately 12%. For Electronic Systems, we saw sales rise 4% in the quarter. Higher sales for the quarter included growth in international and combat avionics programs, partially offset by declines in navigation and maritime systems programs. Operating income declined 2% and operating margin rate declined to 15.4%. Operating income reflects a lower level of net favorable adjustments than in the prior year period, which more than offset the higher sales. Based on year-to-date performance, we continue to expect ES 2013 sales to increase to at least $7.1 billion with an operating margin rate in the high 16% range. Revenue guidance includes continued growth in international and space volume and margin rate guidance anticipates performance generally consistent with our year-to-date results. Moving to Information Systems. Third quarter sales declined 9%. Transfer of intercompany efforts to our enterprise shared services organization and portfolio-shaping activities accounted for $17 million of the decline. So excluding those transfer and portfolio-shaping activities, sales declined, if you want to call it organically, about 8% due to lower volume across a broad number of programs. IS continues to be impacted by lower funding levels, contract inflations and in-theater force reductions. I think as many of you know, of all of our 4 businesses, IS has been the most impacted by sequestration. Although operating income declined slightly for the quarter, margin rate expanded by 40 basis points due to improved performance. We continue to expect IS sales of about $6.6 billion for the year and a mid 9% margin rate, consistent with year-to-date results. Finally, on Technical Services. Third quarter sales declined by 5% with lower volume in integrated logistics and modernization programs, along with some lower volume in the ICBM program as the principal drivers of the revenue decline. Operating income, although, increased 8% and operating margin rate improved 110 basis points to 9.4%, reflecting improved performance across several programs and a higher level of net favorable adjustments than in the prior period. For 2013, we expect Technical Services sales of $2.8 billion versus our prior estimate of $2.7 billion. And we are increasing our expected operating margin rate to approximately 9% from a mid- to high 8% range previously. So on a consolidated basis, third quarter segment operating margin rate improved 90 basis points to 12.5%, which includes or reflects a $22 million increase in net favorable adjustments in the quarter. That improvement largely came from Aerospace Systems, to some extent from Technical Services, which was partially offset by lower net favorable adjustments in Electronic Systems. So based on year-to-date results, we now see a 2013 segment margin rate in the low to mid-12% range. Third quarter total operating income increased 7% due to the 5% increase in segment operating income and a $27 million improvement in our net FAS/CAS pension adjustment. That improvement, the net FAS/CAS improvement, represents 9 months of increase in our CAS recoveries based on updated demographic experience as of the beginning of the year. Prior CAS estimates were based on estimated demographic data. For the year, we now expect the net FAS/CAS pension adjustment will be about $160 million. And then third quarter interest expense increased $17 million basically due to the additional $2 billion of debt we raised in the second quarter. Based on the updated segment operating margin and pension estimates, we now see 2013 total operating margin rate in the low to mid-12% range. Turning to taxes. Third quarter tax rate declined 31% from 34% last year with the lower rate including an additional $16 million benefit associated with our 2012 federal tax return, as well as $6 million of R&D benefit in the quarter, resulting from the restoration of the R&D credit under the American Taxpayer Relief Act. So for the year, we now see a 32% tax rate for the year. Cash before discretionary pension contributions. On a year-to-date basis, cash from operations totaled $1.6 billion. Free cash flow before discretionary pension contributions was $1.5 billion, reflecting a year-to-date free cash flow conversion of 100%. So based on those year-to-date results, we are increasing guidance for cash from operations to $2.3 billion to $2.6 billion and for free cash flow to $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion. I would also note that our updated EPS guidance assumes that share repurchases will reduce our weighted average shares outstanding for the year to approximately 234 million shares or a decrease of about 8% from last year's weighted average shares outstanding. And that's versus our prior guidance of 7%. On a year-to-date basis, we repurchased 20.6 million shares. As you know in May, we announced a goal of retiring 25% of our common stock or 60 million shares by the end of 2015, market conditions permitting. During the second and third quarters, we repurchased slightly more than 14 million shares or nearly 25% of that 60 million share repurchase goal. So lastly, let me take a few moments and provide some comments related to potential 2014 pension cost. And I'm going to use September 30 as a baseline. And as of September 30, our year-to-date investment returns are approximately 4%. And based on the 10-year treasury rate, we could see an increase of approximately 80 basis points in the discount rate, which would give us a discount rate of about 4.92%. So if we were able to set our 2014 FAS expense using that 4% year-to-date investment returns and a 4.9% discount rate, our estimate of 2014 FAS expense would be about $315 million. So holding all other assumptions constant, every 25 basis points change, and this assumed 4.9% discount rate, results in about a $60 million change in 2014 FAS expense. The impact of the higher discount rate and the 4% investment returns likely would improve our funded status in all the plans to over 90% from the 83% we had at the end of last year. And then finally, at this point, we would expect 2014 CAS expense to increase to about $625 million, partly or largely due to the benefits of CAS optimization [ph]. Now I know I should point out that and remind you all that our assumptions can change, likely to change between these estimates and year end. So we're going to have to really see where we end up at the end of the year in terms of discount rates and investment returns. And I also should point out that under these same set of assumptions, our required cash contributions for 2014 would remain under $100 million. So Steve, I think with that, we're ready to take some Q&A.
Stephen C. Movius: Great. Thanks, Jim. [Operator Instructions] Frances, we are ready to begin the Q&A session.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Wes, I wondered if we could just maybe try to discuss what you were talking about with the 2014 top line a little further. I know you gave us some color directionally there but with somewhat limited quantification. Maybe if you just assume sequestration holds relatively close to its current form, how would you expect the pace of decline in 2014 to look? And is it possible that -- you mentioned sort of the shorter-cycle versus the longer-cycle dynamics, which you saw pretty clearly or you're seeing pretty clearly in 2013. Is it reasonable to sort of expect actually all of the operating segments to look reasonably similar in terms of the pace, the rate of change in '14 versus '13?
Wesley G. Bush: Noah, I think inherent in your question is the reality of a lot of moving parts here. Clearly, it's too early to tell which way the budget outcome will be. You suggested a thought process around a continuing sequester. And clearly, as we make our plans for our cost structure and our overall approach, that's heavy on our minds and we want to be prepared for just about any outcome that might ensue here. But one thing I would point out that I think it's important for everyone to understand as we think about 2014 and, Noah, to your point, the difference between the short-cycle and the long-cycle businesses, in each year, the definition of a short-cycle business is that they are going to be more attuned to what actually happens in the amounts that the customer community can go out and obligate within the year, whereas for the longer-cycle businesses, their sales in any particular year are more heavily dominated by what was obligated in prior years. So there's sort of a delay effect and even actually a filtering effect, if you will, that goes into the calculus for the sales on an annual basis in the longer-cycle businesses. And that inherently provides a little less volatility in what we see in the longer-cycle businesses in any particular year-over-year comparison. But the shorter-cycle businesses, as I mentioned, are more directly attuned to what's actually getting obligated year-by-year. So in the situation that you described, where we do have part 2 of the sequester next year, where there's something in the order of another $20 billion that gets addressed towards the DoD accounts, we would expect that to show up more quickly in the short-cycle businesses. I think that's about as much color as I can give you on it. Until we see some more particulars and details, it's hard to get out in front of that, and I wouldn't think it wise to try to.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland from Barclays.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I wanted to ask a question, Wes, about something you guys have talked about on prior calls and just sort of overall competitiveness. And I want to you to, if you can, address kind of a couple of elements of that, whether it's the impact of pension or IRAD or your overhead rates and how you think about your cost structure. I mean, obviously, the F-16 win was a big strategic win you called out. But there's been some other big competitions that haven't gone your way this year in jammer and AMDR and some of these others. And as you look out at how Northrop Grumman competes vis-à-vis its peers as we go into next year with obviously a pension benefit, you've been pretty aggressive on the cost structure, how do you think about competitiveness as we look into next year and you try to grow in your growth areas?
Wesley G. Bush: Carter, I can give you 2 dimensions to that. Competitiveness obviously has a strong component of cost structure and sort of the broader affordability actions that we've been taking for some time. And I'll come back and touch on that. But competitiveness also has a strong component around innovation and our ability to continuously put forward new ideas and be competitive on the basis of good thinking, and that requires investment. And so let me touch the innovation part of it first. As a company, we've been working hard to ensure that we can maintain our investments in technology across the board. We are a technology-driven company. And it is just an absolute strategic imperative for us to make sure that we are both maintaining our own internal investment and that we are doing a good job of capturing the available opportunities for customer investment in advanced technology within our company. So that's a strong part of not only our culture but our operating discipline and our ongoing operating rhythm within the enterprise. You've heard in my remarks a few comments about our capital investments and how we're going to continue to make sure that we are investing for the long term in our infrastructure so that we're able to be innovative and able to support the type of research and development that we know we need to do to stay at the top of the pack in that regard. So from a broad competitiveness perspective, innovation is a big part of it. Affordability is another big part of it. And just our overall cost structure is something that we've been aggressively addressing over the last number of years. And it comes in just about every flavor that you can imagine of the cost structure, and you listed several of them. In terms of the headcount part of this and our overhead structure, we have been going at that very aggressively. Through the end of September, our headcount is down about 19% from our peak of just a few years ago. So that doesn't just happen. That's the result of the entire organization realigning itself to a much tighter cost structure, much tighter management structure across the enterprise and a much more efficient way of operating. We've made similar large reductions in our footprint. And when we look across the board at all the components of our overheads and the direct cost that go into our contracts, we've been very aggressively addressing those. Jim has talked a little bit in the past about pension and the actions that we've taken to make sure that our pension plan is well-funded and some of the benefits that, that provides us. So that's also another component to it. So competitiveness is a multidimensional beast. It's one that we take very, very seriously. We do look at every single contract loss as well as every contract win and go after a set of lessons learned from that to make sure that we're doing the very best that we can on all fronts. And the other thing I would mention with respect to some of the recent contract announcements, I think some of the things that you've seen us do, AMDR is a good example of it, where we are pressing the boundaries of areas where we have historically not had much of a footprint and attempting to see if we can go into some of those areas. We're going to be successful at some and not successful at others, but we're going to keep doing that because I think we have a lot of opportunity to leverage the incredible technological capacity of this enterprise to continue to support our customers in new and different ways. So that's kind of a long-winded answer to your question, Carter. But I think it's important to have that framework as we think about the future of our enterprise.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Elizabeth Grenfell - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: This is actually Elizabeth on for Ron. I just actually had a question regarding your backlog. Yesterday, Lockheed reported that their aeronautics backlog was up and yours is down. So I was wondering if that has to do with how you're recognizing LRIP 6 and 7 of the F-35. Or what's driving that decline?
Wesley G. Bush: Well, we're certainly more than just F-35 in our overall backlog. And if you look particularly though at F-35, we did book LRIP 6 and 7 back in the second quarter, not in the third quarter. And so there's a timing differential that goes with any particular program within the overall backlog. But year-to-date, our backlog across the board is, I think, performing very competitively and certainly continues to be an area of strong focus for us.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi.
Jonathan Raviv: It's Jon Raviv on for Jason. Just a question in talking about cash flow, operating and free cash flow building blocks for next year. It sounds like pension could provide a tailwind certainly from a required perspective. But also from a discretionary contribution perspective, can you talk about that? And then also you mentioned that CapEx might be up. So can you just size those different moving pieces as we move from this year to next year on that cash flow line?
James F. Palmer: Jon, we will give our 2014 guidance in January when we -- in accordance with our normal plan when we release fourth quarter results. I do agree that not having required contributions in 2014 or not expecting to have required 2014 contribution is a benefit. But we'll just wait until to January when we give all of our guidance for 2014.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: The question I had was more of a top-level question maybe for you, Wes or Jim, from your insights and history. You're bringing down, and not just you, but the industry is bringing down its workforce at a pretty healthy pace. And it's a painful process, but you're bringing it down well in advance of the revenue declines that are showing up. And is there any quality of service metrics that you're using from the customer that you're still keeping up with the quality of service that they're asking for, that there's no dropping of the ball here? Obviously, it's a hard process to manage on the way down and sometimes, you cut too much before you realize it. I'm just curious how you're measuring that as you go.
Wesley G. Bush: Yes, Myles, that's a very insightful question. And let me give you a little bit of color on sort of a few dimensions to it. We constantly are monitoring the view of our customers in terms of our performance in a number of different dimensions. We are fortunate to work in our industry, where we get an enormous amount of feedback from our customers, whether it's award fee scores or the CPARs that we get or the regular interaction that we have because our team is working with our customers arm-in-arm every day. We receive an enormous amount of input. And we also receive that on the quality side as well. So it is actually something that we built into our operating rhythm within the company, our operating review process, and look at it across every single one of our businesses every month in our entire enterprise. And we have it built into our incentive system as well. So it is an area where that feedback mechanism is absolutely critical. And we're trying to make sure that we are not just looking in the rearview mirror and looking at that feedback. We're working to ensure that the real-time nature of that is impacting our planning in each of these areas. When I think about the kind of the human part of this equation on a go-forward basis across our enterprise, it clearly is important that we find the right balance in staffing levels. But it's also incredibly important that we manage what we have in terms of the overall intellectual capacity of the enterprise across the industry and at least the civilian side of the government enterprise. We do have a shifting demographics. And that means we have a large number of folks who are well within the timeframe of a 10-year retirement cycle. And it poses some real challenges for all of us across our enterprise to make sure that we're doing the right thing in bringing the newer parts or the newer members of our organization up to speed very, very quickly. It also means that we're out recruiting aggressively. And an interesting thing about our industry right now is that while we are bringing the headcount down, because of that transitioning demographic, we are out recruiting aggressively. In fact, within our company, I mentioned to you that we brought our headcount down about 19% since our peak of just a few years ago. We're going to hire on the order of 4,000 to 5,000 people at Northrop Grumman this year. And it is something that a lot of people don't expect that, that's actually what's going on. So we're bringing in a lot of folks. We're bringing in a lot of bright folks. We're bringing in quite honestly in some areas some new innovative thinking that's actually making us better in a lot of dimensions, so there's a strong positive upside to this. But there's also a strong part of managing that transition to make sure that we can, with very high confidence, continue to deliver all of the things, not only that we've signed up to but that we're out pursuing as we go forward into the future. So the people side of the equation, not only in our company but across our industry and across more broadly the defense enterprise, is a big part of the equation here over the coming years that's going to require a lot of very focused management attention to make sure we get it right.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: That's good color. And just a clarification, Wes, it's not -- it is really a workforce reduction, it's not an outsourcing make-buy decision that's causing that accelerated decline in the labor force, is it?
Wesley G. Bush: No, it's not a make-buy. In fact, I will tell you there have been some areas where we've had to bring things in-house because of some weakness in the supply chain. Yes, and that's not generally something that we like to do, but we will do it where we need to, to make sure that we're going to be able to deliver our products and services. So we have, over the past now 3 years, really ramped up our monitoring engagement with our supply chain, so we can stay out ahead of those kind of issues.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Wes, you talked about some of the uncertain environment with regards to the budget and continuing resolution. And I'm just wondering, can you talk about how you think about that with respect to the capital deployment and the plan to shrink share count by 25%? Because in a quarter where there probably was a lot more uncertainty, it seems like you had really stepped up the buyback activity relative to previous quarters. So I mean, should we expect to see more clarity before you really step up more? Should it continue at this kind of pace? Can you just talk about them?
Wesley G. Bush: Sam, we think about that a lot all the time. And I would just give sort of a couple basic principles. First is we take a long-term view when it comes to capital deployment, in particular share repurchase. We take a long-term view of the value that we see in our enterprise and how we see the various forces out there impacting that sort of a long-term value perspective. We're clearly an enterprise that's generating a lot of cash. And we also look at -- and so this would be the sort of the second principle, we look at the alternatives for the use of that cash and how we help generate that long-term value through the uses of the cash. So it's not as if we just set the throttle on one speed and just stay throttled up whatever happens. We constantly are assessing those parameters as well as our environment and making our decisions on that basis.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Doug Harned from Sanford Bernstein.
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: On Electronic Systems, over time, your backlog has come down a little bit. You're now below $9 billion for the first time in quite some time. The revenues have held up reasonably well. Could you talk about how you see the top line going forward? And I'd say both the contribution from U.S. and from international, is this something we should expect, more of a top line decline here? Or can this turn around?
James F. Palmer: Doug, this is Jim. I think our guys at ES have been doing a fabulous job frankly, and backlog is a -- with the large international content that our ES sector has, backlog is always influenced by the timing of those major international orders. Probably that's the impact that you're seeing more than anything else, I believe, in Electronic Systems. Once you win one of those major programs, you have a revenue stream that likely lasts for a number of years. Typically, those programs have an S-curve associated with them, where you start off smaller and build over time, and then decline as you get near completion. So we haven't given guidance for '14 yet, so I think the comments that Wes had at the beginning of the call around the longer-cycle businesses likely having a better balance, if you will, as we go into '14 are how I would frame it at this point.
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: And if I can, just on when you're looking at the long versus short cycle, on the IS&T side, when you look at that, I guess, you call it more of an 8% reduction right now. How much of that has been due to in-theater force reduction? How big a portion of that would you tie it to this?
James F. Palmer: Across our portfolio, and largely IS and TS have the biggest exposure to the in-theater. We have been estimating that in the aggregate for the year, it would be about $300 million. I would say probably about 1/2 to 2/3 of that is from the IS sector.
Wesley G. Bush: Some in ES as well, yes.
James F. Palmer: But it's largely there.
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: And some in TS, too?
James F. Palmer: Some in TS.
Wesley G. Bush: A little bit in TS, yes. But it's really IS and ES. And as we go forward into '14, obviously with the drawdown sort of winding down, we would expect that over the course of '14, we'd pretty much see the tail of it.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Joe Nadol from JPMorgan.
Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Wes, I wanted to engage you actually on a similar topic, the short-cycle, long-cycle thing but really focusing in on IS. And you've had a little bit of a pop in the backlog here this past quarter. You've led us to believe that next year, it's going to be weaker than the other sectors and I can see that, given the longer backlog trajectory year-on-year, I guess. But do you think that's the last year next year where we say that and maybe the lines cross going up beyond that? I'm not asking for guidance obviously. But just in terms of profile, do you think maybe next year is the last year? And then just within IS, you've talked about the different pieces in the past and how you're pretty comfortable with how you're positioned. Maybe just give a little update as to where we saw some of the backlog strength and how you're thinking about the various pieces from here.
Wesley G. Bush: Sure. If I had a crystal ball, I'd feel a lot better about the outlook here. And I know there's a lot of concern and consternation about what happens with some of the shorter-cycle businesses. But I guess, the way I would frame it is, it's one of those effects that has the shortest time constant, sort of from a physics perspective. When things are going down in a top line environment, they're going to go down the fastest. And when things start turning, they'll go up more quickly because of the inherent built-up demand, pent-up demand that gets sprung loose once things turn around a little bit and the fact that they are short cycle. So is '14 a bottom for the short-cycle businesses across our industry? I don't know. It all depends on what happens with things like sequester and the broader budget decisions that are in front of us, so hard for me to call that one. All I can say is it will react faster to whatever the change in the budget environment turns out to be. With respect to your question on the components of IS sort of across the board, the businesses had been doing, I think, reasonably well. There are parts of that business -- and so we talk about short cycle and long cycle. Within IS, there are shorter, shorter cycles and slightly longer shorter cycles. And I would say a lot of the work that we do on the defense side probably has a little bit of the longer of the shorter cycle in IS. And it's probably been a little bit stronger to some of what we've been seeing here. And some of the work that we do on the intel side as well has that characteristic. Steve has described in the past sort of the delineation between the different parts of the businesses, where on the order of about 40% is kind of what you put into that maybe shorter, shorter-cycle piece. And so it has different characteristics, more driven though by the nature of the work being done than it does by the nature of who the customer is because all of our customers have some degree of longer-term contracting versus shorter-term contracting.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Cai Von Rumohr from Cowen and Company.
Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Actually, 2 questions. The first one is 2014, while we have a lot of visibility issues, presumably you have some visibility of your foreign business. That's longer lead time. Can you give us a rough sense of what percent will foreign be of your sales this year? Is it still 7% or 8%? And what sort of relative growth rate would you expect? Give us a range for next year.
James F. Palmer: Yes. Cai, we had said that for 2013, we expect our international revenues to be in the 10% range. It was about 8% in 2012. So for '13, we're looking at in the 10% range for the international revenues. Again, I think it's a growth area for us. I'm not going to give you a number for 2014 since we haven't given guidance for 2014. It does feel like it's going to be increased as well again as we look to next year.
Wesley G. Bush: Yes. Cai, I guess, the color I would give on that is as we've talked about our opportunities on international, you can see that some of them are a little bit longer in development wave than others. Clearly, unmanned is an area that we see over the longer term as having a lot of opportunity, whether we're talking about Korea, Australia or Japan, many of the countries that have been quite open and vocal about their strong interest in growing their unmanned capabilities. And it's upbeat [ph] by being supported by the U.S. in that regard. C4ISR is another area where we see a lot of opportunities around the globe. And those also sometimes take awhile to develop. As Jim referenced earlier, and I think in one of the responses to one of the earlier questions about Electronic Systems, ES continues to have a very strong international business base. And we continue to see a lot of interest and a lot of demand for pretty much their full product set. So that is encouraging to us. And as you know, we have a big footprint on both the Joint Strike Fighter and the F-18. So all of those areas put together suggest a nice set of international opportunities for us as we look into the future.
Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then a second question. I think earlier this year, you talked about an objective of taking your share count down 25% by the end of 2015. As your stock price has kind of moved up so aggressively here, what's the tradeoff? Are you going to back off from that or kind of commit more of your cash flow to that? How does that all work?
James F. Palmer: Yes. Cai, when we announced the 25% reduction goal, we characterized it as market conditions permitting. As Wes responded to an earlier question, we do take a long-term view of the company, its portfolio, how well it's positioned, the revenue and cash flow-generating capability of the company. And we make decisions on a regular basis about the pace and the quantity at which we buy based on the facts and circumstances at that point in time. We haven't backed off at the 25% goal at this point. As I mentioned for the first 2 quarters that the goal has been in place, we've repurchased a little bit over 14 million shares or almost 25% of the goal. So we, I think, have plenty of flexibility to deal with the overall goal as we look through the next little bit over 2-plus years.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research.
George Shapiro: The question I have is we keep hearing the long-cycle businesses. I had thought that by '14, we would start to see the long-cycle businesses have an impact. I mean, but maybe, I guess, the backlogs are a little bit longer than I thought. So do we push that out to '15 now, where you really start to see the long-cycle businesses start to match up with kind of what we've seen for some of the shorter-cycle businesses?
James F. Palmer: George, if you think about the typical life cycle of those long-cycle businesses, you're probably thinking about kind of a 3-year period of performance, 2 to 3 years, maybe even a little bit longer depending upon the nature of the products. So really all of this is going to depend on those budgetary decisions that are going to need to be made as Congress deals with the 2014 budget and whether or not there are any major changes to individual programs. All of those will be the major driving factors on the long-cycle business, I believe, more so than anything else.
Wesley G. Bush: And George, there's another effect as well that I think is sometimes missed in the process. When monies are appropriated, they're not instantly obligated. And so it takes some time. And sometimes, that time is measured in more than a year between when it's appropriated and when it gets obligated. And so we're still seeing things getting obligated that were appropriated 2 years ago. So that is another part of that delay or stretch, if you will, that is more inherent in the long-cycle business.
James F. Palmer: The nature of the business, as you know, George, unless there are unexpected decisions made on program changes or cancellations, the nature of the business with its long cycle gives you time to look through the windshield of what's coming your way and make your cost decisions to manage the company in anticipation of what you see coming your way. So again, without unexpected decisions, we have the ability basically to manage the business based on what we see coming.
George Shapiro: No, I appreciate that. And you guys have done a great job in trying to do that. But I was looking at it from a standpoint of the revenue side when we start to see the revenue step down from some of these long-cycle businesses like we've already seen from the short cycle. I wasn't questioning the margin side of it.
Wesley G. Bush: Yes, it's kind of hard -- it's hard to predict based on how the flow of obligated amounts is going to go and what the spend rate is of those obligated amounts over the duration of the program. So kind of hard to call that at this point.
Stephen C. Movius: Frances, at this time, I'd like to conclude this session. I'd like to turn the call over to Wes for final comments.
Wesley G. Bush: I'd just want to wrap up again by thanking all of our employees across the enterprise for their continuing hard work and commitment and also thanking our partners in government for all that they're doing. Our nation just put our government employees through a pretty tough period over the past month, not something that should have happened but something that did happen. And I will tell you from my own observation, that's a team that stood tall and continued to execute their mission very well. So we're all fortunate to be beneficiaries of their hard work as we go forward. Thanks, everyone. Thanks for your continuing interest in our company.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Northrop Grumman Second Quarter 2013 Conference Call. My name is Carla, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Steve Movius, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Movius, please proceed.
Stephen C. Movius: Thanks, Carla, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's Second Quarter 2013 Conference Call. We have provided a PowerPoint presentation for the second quarter, which you can access at www.northropgrumman.com. Before we start, please understand that matters discussed on today's call constitute forward-looking statements, pursuant to Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which are detailed in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risk factors may cause actual company results to differ materially. On the call today are Wes Bush, our Chairman, CEO and President; and Jim Palmer, our CFO. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Wes.
Wesley G. Bush: Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We're very pleased with our second quarter results. They were achieved through the hard work and dedication of the entire Northrop Grumman team. As a company, we continue to focus on performance and effective cash deployment as major value drivers. In the second quarter, these efforts drove a 9% increase in earnings per share and strong cash from operations and free cash flow. This quarter's EPS growth reflects solid sales, higher segment operating income and lower weighted average shares outstanding. Second quarter sales were slightly higher than last year at $6.3 billion. Segment operating income increased 2%, and segment operating margin rate increased 20 basis points to 12.7%. Jim will provide more detail on the sales and margin rate trends, but the underlying drivers for this quarter's performance were higher sales and strong operating income and margin rates for our longer-cycle businesses: Aerospace Systems and Electronic Systems. These positive trends were partially offset by budget-related top line pressure in our shorter-cycle businesses: Information Systems and Technical Services. Even considering that top line pressure, as I look across our businesses, all in all, it was an outstanding operating performance from our team. As a result of our strong first half results, we are raising our sales guidance to approximately $24.3 billion, and we are raising EPS guidance to a range of $7.60 to $7.80. We continue to expect cash from operations of $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion and free cash flow of $1.7 billion to $2 billion. Guidance for both of these cash metrics is before discretionary pension contributions. We continue to be focused on deploying cash to create long-term value. In May, we raised the dividend 11%, our 10th consecutive annual dividend increase. Our board also authorized an additional $4 billion for share repurchases. When we announced this new authorization, we indicated our goal of retiring approximately 25% of our then outstanding common stock or about 60 million shares by the end of 2015, market conditions permitting. During the second quarter, we repurchased 6.1 million shares of stock for $489 million. Year-to-date, we have repurchased 12.6 million shares of our stock for approximately $900 million. We anticipate share repurchases will reduce 2013 weighted average shares outstanding by approximately 7%. At the end of the second quarter, approximately $4.6 billion remained in our share repurchase authorization. In addition to share repurchases, during the quarter, we also made a $500 million discretionary contribution to our pension plans. We also raised $2.85 billion in new debt in the second quarter. We used $850 million of these proceeds to retire debt due in 2014 and 2015, resulting in $2 billion of net new debt. These transactions lowered our cost of borrowing, took advantage of historically low interest rates and allowed us to extend our weighted average debt maturity. The additional cash from this financing activity enhances our financial flexibility in today's dynamic budget environment. We ended the quarter with a total backlog of $37.7 billion, which reflects gross new awards of $5.5 billion and 87% book-to-bill. Year-to-date, gross new awards totaled $10.3 billion for a book-to-bill of 83%. During the first half of the year, we received significant awards for programs such as F-35, Advanced EHF, Global Hawk, B-2 and the E-2D Advanced Hawkeye. Generally speaking, the pace of new awards continues to be impacted by the face of budget uncertainty. Understandably, this environment is producing fewer new awards and reducing spending on existing programs, particularly in our shorter-cycle businesses. While these businesses are experiencing more of an impact in the near term, we continue to see their longer-term value creation potential as integral to our company's efforts in C4ISR, Cyber and Logistics and Modernization. Last month, the DoD provided Congress with information on how fiscal year 2013 sequestration reductions will be distributed across spending accounts and funding lines. At this point, we do not see major disruptions to our 2013 revenues, and the impacts that we are able to anticipate and quantify are reflected in our guidance. Over the last several years, we've been proactive in positioning the company for a declining budget environment, and we continue to aggressively examine all elements of our cost structure. As I've said before, we believe that sequestration that's currently enacted will have serious negative consequences for our national security and will increasingly harm the defense industrial base over time. While we won't be introducing '24 (sic) guidance until next year, looking ahead, we believe that reduced fiscal year 2013 budgets will result in lower 2013 awards and that the related impacts to company revenues, earnings and cash flows likely will trail reduced awards. The President's proposed fiscal year 2014 budget is $50 billion, above the Budget Control Act Part II requirements. Unless Congress acts to modify the Budget Control Act, we expect fiscal year 2014 sequestration will be triggered in January of 2014, with so few congressional working days left until the end of this fiscal year and near-term agreement on 2014 appropriation seems unlikely. And we are currently planning for another continuing resolution and the potential for another round of sequestration. While the budget environment is unpredictable and disruptive in the short term, we are positioning Northrop Grumman for the long term. That means continuing to focus on aligning our portfolio with the enduring priority areas of investment for global security, Unmanned, C4ISR, Cyber and Logistics and Modernization, along with manned military aircraft. It also means achieving and sustaining a high level of financial and program performance and effectively deploying our substantial cash resources to create value. Before I turn the call over to Jim, I'd like to congratulate the Navy and the Northrop Grumman X-47B team on making naval aviation history. Over the last few weeks, the X-47B achieved several technical milestones. These achievements culminated in the first-ever fighter-sized unmanned aircraft demonstrating an arrested landing when the X-47B landed on the USS George H.W. Bush on July 10. The autonomous landing relied on computer-to-computer communications to establish the carrier's position and react to the dynamic variables associated with this type of landing. Aircraft carrier landings are difficult, and these technical milestones demonstrate that the Navy's goal of operating unmanned systems safely and effectively from aircraft carriers is well on its way to becoming a reality. Together with the Navy, we also achieved another major unmanned milestone in May with the successful first flight of the MQ-4C Triton. Triton is designed to allow the Navy to monitor significantly larger areas of the ocean with greater persistence than currently possible. Triton's first flight represents a critical step forward in supporting the Navy's future maritime surveillance mission around the world. So now I'll turn the call over to Jim for a more detailed discussion of results and guidance. Jim?
James F. Palmer: Thanks, Wes, and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. My comments will focus on the second quarter and year-to-date results, as well as our 2013 guidance. As Wes said, this was another really good quarter. Our team continues to focus on performance and execution, and I personally want to add my appreciation for our team's continued focus and dedication. Turning to the sectors. Aerospace Systems sales increased more than $200 million or 9%. The single largest driver was the higher F-35 volume. We have delivered 11 LRIP 5 units this quarter compared with no LRIP 5 deliveries in the second quarter of 2012. You will recall that with LRIP 5, the F-35 program transitioned from cost-to-cost revenue recognition to units-of-delivery accounting. We delivered the first LRIP 5 units in the third quarter of last year. Unmanned revenue also continues to increase. While our Global Hawk program is maturing, we'll continue to ramp up another unmanned program such as NATO AGS and Fire Scout. Space revenues also increased due to higher volumes for AEHF and the James Webb Space Telescope programs. Those increases in space were partially offset by lower volume for our restricted space programs. AS operating margin increased 15% due to the higher sales and a $26 million increase in net favorable adjustments principally for space programs. Based on year-to-date results, we now expect AS 2013 sales of approximately $9.9 billion, with a margin rate of approximately 12%. Expected second half revenues are modestly lower due to fewer F-35 deliveries in the third and fourth quarter of this year. During the first half of the year, we delivered 21 F-35 units, and 18 units are planned for the second half of the year. Turning to Electronic Systems. Sales rose 2%. Higher revenue for international, tactical sensors and space programs more than offset lower volume in other product areas such as navigation, combat avionics, maritime systems, infrared countermeasures and laser systems. Operating margin, on the other hand, increased 17%, and operating margin rate increased 240 basis points to 18.2%. The primary driver of the higher operating income is a $34 million increase in net favorable adjustments due to improved performance, principally in our marine and space programs. The remainder of the improvement reflects higher overall margin rates resulting in part from last year's favorable adjustments. Based on year-to-date performance, we now expect Electronic Systems sales to increase to at least $7.1 billion, with an operating margin rate in the low 16% range. Revenue guidance includes the continued ramp-up in international and space volume, and margin rate guidance anticipates a lower level of favorable adjustments than in the first half of the year. Transitioning to Information Systems. Second quarter sales declined 9%. The transfer of intercompany efforts associated with our -- some of our internal activities to enterprise shared services, as well as some modest portfolio shaping, accounted for $33 million of the decline. Excluding the transfer and the portfolio shaping, sales declined about 7%, with lower volume across a broad number of programs. IS operating income declined as a result of the lower sales, a $27 million reduction in net favorable adjustments, commercial contract revenue timing and mix results from the ramp-down of several in-theater fixed price contracts. Rather than looking at second quarter's 8.3% operating margin rate, Information Systems' year-to-date operating margin rate of 9.3% is more instructive as an indication of ongoing performance. As we mentioned last quarter, our guidance for IS had some modest downside risk to sales given the sequestration and general budget impacts. So as a result of those trends, our guidance now contemplates sales of approximately $6.6 billion for Information Systems, and we now expect a low-to-mid 9% operating margin rate, essentially consistent with the year-to-date margin rate. Moving to Technical Systems. Second quarter sales declined 8%, with operating margin declining 7%. Lower ICBM and KC-10 volume impacted sales by about $40 million, and portfolio shaping impacted sales by an additional $20 million. The operating trend is consistent with sales, and operating margin rate is roughly comparable to last year. For 2013, we continue to expect sales of approximately $2.7 billion, with a mid-to-high 8% operating margin rate. So on a consolidated basis, second quarter segment operating margin rate improved 20 basis points to 12.7%, primarily due to the $25 million increase in net favorable adjustments in the quarter. That improvement largely came from Aerospace Systems and Electronic Systems and then partially offset by lower net favorable adjustments in Information Systems and a smaller amount in Technical Services. Total operating income increased 4% due to the higher segment operating income and lower corporate and allocated expenses. Second quarter interest expense increased $9 million, reflecting the 1 month of interest on the $2.85 billion of new debt and a weighted average coupon of 3.3%. At the end of June, we used $850 million of those debt proceeds to retire the debt that was maturing in 2014 and '15. These actions lowered our weighted average borrow cost by 11% from 5.3% to 4.7% while increasing the weighted average life of our debt portfolio by 40% from 4.8 to 13.6 years. For modeling purposes, the net impact of these actions will increase our 2013 interest expense on a year-over-year basis by about $45 million, with most of that increase occurring in the second half of the year. Turning to cash. Before the $500 million discretionary pension contribution, year-to-date operations generated approximately $740 million of cash, generally consistent with prior year results at the midpoint of the year. Free cash flow, on the other hand, before the discretionary pension contributions, totaled $692 million for the quarter, and year-to-date free cash flow is $653 million, also consistent with last year. At this point in time, we are maintaining our 2013 cash flow guidance. As many of you know, our cash flows are traditionally weighted towards the second half of the year -- heavily weighted, I might add, with lots of variation around the timing of year-end cash receipts. Given our lack of experience or knowledge regarding how the furloughing of government employees may impact the timing of payments in the second half of the year, we are maintaining our current cash flow guidance. As we gain more experience regarding whether or not the furloughs will have any impact on the timing of payments, we'll consider whether we need to change our cash flow guidance for this year. But in any case, I expect this is only a matter of timing. I also wanted to point out a couple of items that you'll see in our 10-Q. Total backlog at June 30 reflects the gross new awards of $10.3 billion and a $1 billion reduction in Information Systems' total backlog, primarily to reduce unfunded backlog for expired periods of performance on active contracts, including TASC orders on ID/IQ contracts. TASC orders are structured to provide the customer with significant contract flexibility. As such, even when TASC orders are awarded and they become part of our backlog, there remains some degree of variability around execution of the entire TASC order amount. We continually review our backlog of contracts to provide a reasonable depiction of the future work that they generate. You also see in our 10-Q that we reached a tentative settlement with the IRS for tax audit years 2007 through 2009. If approved by the joint committee on taxation, the settlement would reduce our income tax expense by up to $50 million. As the approval and the timing are uncertain, the potential benefit of the settlement is not included in our 2013 guidance, which at this point assumes an effective tax rate of approximately 33%. And finally, several of you have written reports regarding how the recent rise in interest rates could impact 2014 pension expense and funded status of our pension plans. So I think it's important that I provide some data on the potential impacts for our plans, if the 2014 assumptions -- pension assumptions were to be set at the end of the second quarter. As all of you know, that's not the case. Actual assumptions will be set based on year-end interest rates and planned asset returns for the year. But if I were to use the 10-year treasury yield as a proxy, the discount rate would likely have increased by about 75 to 80 basis points from the end of last year. So while higher interest rates could improve our funded status to around 90% or so from the 83% level that we had at the end of last year, they also reduce returns on the fixed income and international portions of our investment portfolio. As of June 30, planned asset investment returns were approximately 50 basis points. Year-to-date returns largely reflect the impact of the higher interest rates on the fixed income and international portions of the investment portfolio, partially offset by strong market returns on the domestic equities portion of the portfolio. To remind everyone, every 100-basis-point difference in asset investment returns from our assumed 8% investment return for our long-term rate of return assumption changes 2014 FAS expense by about $45 million. And every 25-basis-point change in the discount rate from our assumed rate of 4.12% at the end of last year changes 2014 FAS expense by about $85 million. So if I were to use the June 30 discount rate and asset returns as the basis for setting 2014 FAS expense at this point, 2014 FAS expense would likely be comparable to this year's FAS expense of about $380 million or about $65 million higher than we anticipated at the beginning of 2013. I should also point out that with those same assumptions, based on the June 30 numbers, our required cash contributions would remain under $100 million for 2014. Lastly, I think, again, I should remind you that pension assumptions, including those related to CAS, are set at the end of the year based on actual year-end interest rates and asset returns. And I know as a number of you know, if we look back into the past, a lot can change between now and then. But I did want to provide you with some sensitivities for modeling purposes. So Steve, with that, I think we're ready for Q&A.
Stephen C. Movius: Thanks, Jim. [Operator Instructions] Carla, we're ready to begin the Q&A process.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein.
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: I'm interested in electronics, where you again had a very impressive margin. And it just feels like after that 6 quarters in a row, that upward adjustments, because of good contract performance, it's just -- it's become almost routine. And when you look forward, and certainly, with your guidance, you're looking at lower margins for the rest of the year. But where are you in electronics and do how you think about performance improvement, cost reduction? I guess, I'm wondering, what inning are we in, in terms of being able to continue to improve the performance of these programs and deliver the kinds of margins that we've seen over the last several quarters?
James F. Palmer: Doug, I don't know that I would say we're in an inning. We're on a treadmill, and you got to continually run as fast as the treadmill is going. So we are really focused on that. We have had, frankly, the benefit from a much -- from a number of cost reduction actions we've taken on our backlog with, as well, a number of programs nearing completion, given the -- somewhat as a draw-down. So really good, hard work by the Electronic Systems folks. A lot of focus on being prudent about new contracts that we entered into, all of which are being realized at this point in time. At times, I get asked about our benchmarks for the businesses. I do think that this is a 13-, 14-plus type of business on a long-term basis, but we are realizing some benefits from hard actions that we've taken over the last couple of years.
Wesley G. Bush: Yes, Doug, this is Wes. I just -- I can't resist the opportunity just to say how much hard work is actually going on in Electronic Systems. There's a team that is just completely focused on performance and in all dimensions. And if you turn the clock back a number of years, you'll recall that we went through some pretty challenging times in Electronic Systems with, in particular, some international contracts that just simply did not perform very well. And to their credit, that team has top to bottom learned that set of lessons really dug in on contract performance, really dug in on cost management. And they're just doing an outstanding job. As Jim points out, clearly, we're getting the benefit of cost reductions, which flow into existing contracts. As we enter into new contracts, that certainly is an effect we won't see forever. But given your question, I just can't help but reflect on the journey that we've been on Electronic Systems and really complement the team for their extraordinary work.
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: And just related, we're also seeing you deliver some really good aerospace margins. Are those more linked to specific programs such as F-35 maturing? What's driving that?
James F. Palmer: I would say, Doug, it's across the broad portfolio of products in aerospace.
Wesley G. Bush: Yes, I don't think F-35 is quite yet at a point of maturity where I would say that was a big driver for us. But if you look across the portfolio in aerospace, to Jim's point, particularly our manned programs, more legacy manned programs, and also our space program, have been doing very, very well. Unmanned is still earlier in the evolution of things moving into production, so they're probably not quite as far up that curve. But, again, really good performance, really good focus on cost management.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi.
Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Jim, I wanted to ask you just a couple of quick questions on cash. You mentioned that there's some conservatism in your outlook here for 2013 in light of the furloughs. Can you give us a little bit of flavor of how much conservatism you've baked into that? What kind of cushion are you affording yourself? And then, Wes, you made a comment about the impacts of sequester around in 2014 with regard to revenues, profitability and cash flows, suggesting that they would be under some pressure. But I did want to just dive a little bit further into some of the moving things on cash, such as the discretionary contribution that you may or may not make next year and then cash recovery rates going up. I just want to make sure that your comments were excluding other dynamics that are going on with cash flows and that we won't necessarily see negative pressure overall on cash flows as we move into 2014.
James F. Palmer: I don't think we'll see negative pressures, Jason, on cash flows as we move into 2014. And I did not say conservative guidance. Those were your words.
Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Those are my words.
James F. Palmer: I was trying to emphasize that we always have substantial variation around cash receipts at the end of the year, in particular, frankly, as the industry manage its cash flows. And those last day cash receipts can easily vary by $200 million, $300 million, just based on what's happening in the overall industry. So on one hand, yes, there can be some variation around receipts, particularly in the last couple of days of the year. I don't know how to call what may or may not happen with the furloughing of government employees and whether it has any impact at all on cash receipts. So it just seemed premature at this point to bet on potentially higher cash receipts this year. As I said in our prepared comments, I do think this is only a matter of timing, maybe only a matter of timing of days. But I think there could be some rises [ph] of variability of cash receipts, and it could be greater this year simply because of the environment that we're in.
Wesley G. Bush: Yes, Jason, it's Wes. I just -- I would add. I think what we're all worried about in different ways is what the real impact will be of this furloughing of the civilian workforce. It was just the other day that Secretary Hagel had to basically say, "Look, if this keeps going, we may be furloughing in the next fiscal year as well." And if anybody thinks that, that has no impact, they are not thinking about it with a clear head. It's -- the civilian workforce is an integral component of how our defense and national security infrastructure operates. And it's not just paying the bills. It's manning centers, running intelligent centers, it's -- you name it. Our civilian workforce is extensively deployed throughout the national security framework. So I do think that there is some concern about what that means as we continue to experience this. These are really important people doing really important jobs and trying to predict exactly what the impact of these furloughs will be. It's a very difficult thing. So I think what you should take away from it is sort of an expression of a risk factor, if you will, that's out there in some respect. But as Jim said, ultimately, it's a matter of timing. It's not a matter of do we get paid or not, it's a matter of timing.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies.
Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Wes and Jim, you're not afraid to do something that's unconventional. And so sort of 2 questions. One is, why, with what you've defined as sort of an uncertain environment, how you provided an element of certainty with respect to your share repurchase program?
Wesley G. Bush: Yes, Howard, let me say a few words about that. I'm sure Jim would be happy to join in as well. We've tried to be as clear as we can over these last few years about the way that we see the value creation opportunity in our company. And clearly, it all rests on performance and improving how we've been doing over the years in executing on our contracts and delivering on our commitments to our customers. Everything starts there. And I'm really proud of how our team has been working so hard over these last number of years to demonstrably improve our performance. We're not perfect, we still have a lot of work to do and we're pressing in every corner of the enterprise to go after that in terms of program execution and cost management, you name it. It's across the board. But the other thing that we've been, I think, pretty clear about is the importance of the way in which we pull our capital in creating value. And obviously, it takes a number of forms, whether we're making long-term investments in our pension plan, which ultimately do add value over the long term; whether it's increasing our dividend, and as I said in my prepared remarks, we've taken a very long and steady approach to year-after-year consecutive dividend increases; or whether it's been about share repurchase. And the interesting thing about share repurchases, obviously, we do that when a market condition is permitting in the market from quarter-to-quarter. And we often get the question of, "Gee, is this just something that you guys are doing right now? Or do you see this a continuing part of your strategy?" So as we thought about that question, and we took a hard look at our forecast on a go-forward basis, and as you might imagine, we looked at it in a variety of scenarios in terms of what might happen in the budget arena and programmatic decisions. But as we looked across that range of scenarios, we developed a great degree of, I wouldn't say comfort, you can never be comfortable in running a business, but yes, I would say we developed a great degree of confidence that the cash flows in our business supported taking the action that we took, which was to be clear about where we see ourselves going so that there wasn't this sort of constant question about what are we going to be doing. We indicated what our goal is, and we laid that out there. And we're off executing on it. So we found it just to be an important part of our continuing dialogue with our shareholders about the way we think about creating value, and that really is the essence of our thinking. Jim?
James F. Palmer: Obviously, Wes, I would echo exactly what you said. The only thing I would add -- remember, folks, that we announced our share repurchase, and then about a week later, we also announced that we would go on to the capital markets for our debt transaction. Having made those decisions, we thought it was important that we communicate both pieces of the decision. So all of the information was out there for the market in its entirety. So clearly focused on driving shareholder value, see a significant opportunity there, but also try to be very transparent with all of the market on what our intentions were.
Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: I -- no, I understand that. And it makes -- it's just you have been so conservative to be -- to step out like this clearly underscores your confidence or your, I guess, your confidence in the outlook. And then related to that, I'm sure this wasn't lost on U.S., is that Cisco yesterday bought Sourcefire for something like 7x revenues. And there's a whole host of your cyber business and other things that clearly operate in some of those same markets. How do you react to something like that?
Wesley G. Bush: Clearly, we watched very carefully what's going on in that whole market space, because as you point out, Howard, we have some extraordinary capabilities in addressing elements of that market. One difference, obviously, is we continue to focus on the very high end of the cyber arena to help our nation address the big challenges that we're facing in that regard. We've not put a huge energy into sort of the commercial side of that. And so there is some difference in sort of market perspective and how different companies look at those things. But I would tell you that just if I were standing in Cisco's shoes, I can understand what they're doing. This was an important area. I think it just continues to grow in challenge and complexity. And as we've talked about a little bit on our calls in the past, there's several different aspects of the flavors of cyber, if you will, from -- ranging from the sort of the purer traditional perspectives on cyber to, increasingly, the view on what actually needs to get embedded in the hardware, if you will, the capabilities. And from our perspective, that might be platforms or sensors, but it might also be networking equipment and other things. So I think it's just a representative example of how this issue is becoming more and more pervasive...
James F. Palmer: Growing importance.
Wesley G. Bush: It is. It's an absolutely critically important perspective on its growing importance. And I think we're going to continue to see it become a part of just about every aspect of the technology landscape that we all rely upon to make our world work the way it works today. So from my perspective, this was just another indication of the importance of this arena.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Nadol with JPMorgan.
Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Wes or Jim, my comment -- or my question is on backlog. So backlog is down. I'm focused on funded, and I understand the issue in IS in the unfunded area. But just focusing on funded, you're down about 10% year-to-date and sort of in equal amounts in Q1 and Q2. Some other companies' backlog has tended to be a little bit more seasonal than yours. Yours doesn't seem to be as much so. But obviously, market conditions are tough. So wondering if you could comment on where specifically you think you might end up the year on funded backlog. And then maybe, Wes, if you could just go through each of the businesses quickly, particularly AS and ES, and comment on what the major moving parts might be.
Wesley G. Bush: No, I would just -- I think I addressed this a little bit on our last quarterly call, kind of trying to call it for the end of the year on backlog. I wouldn't do it at this point. There are so many variables out there that are shaping not only the decision space but what I would call the behavior space of our customer community. Many of our customers are just very, very concerned about decisions they make this year, having to flow through into the next few years, and they're kind of holding back, waiting to see what may or may not happen. And I understand that behavior. I understand that difficulty in making decisions when, in fact, they're getting asked to turn out a whole new idea on budget every few weeks. They're getting put through an enormous number of what-if cycles. I actually admire how they're handling this in light of all of the challenges that they're facing. So where this all comes out and how that will translate into specific contracting behaviors over the course of this year, it's really hard to tell. So I wouldn't want to get in front of our headlights on that and try and call it. But what I would say is that it has put an emphasis within our company on working with our customers to really help understand where things need to get put on contract to actually reduce cost, because as we all know, the longer things take, oftentimes, that means there is additional cost induced by that delay in getting things on contract. So it's an intense source of effort across our enterprise to work with our customers to try and balance out the challenge that they are dealing with, as well as what it takes to maintain the cost of the systems and to make sure that things are operating as efficiently as they can in this environment, which is inherently inefficient. So I won't call it, at this point, on what the outlook will be for the end of the year, just given the number of variables in front of us. But I would emphasize the degree at which it has the attention of the enterprise and working it. You asked for AS and ES. The vast majority of our revenues, certainly, this year, like most other years, come from contracts already awarded. So it's not so much a big swinger on what our financial outcomes are this year. And to the extent that we're aware of any, we've already included that in the guidance -- the updated guidance that we provided today. As we look across the landscape, there are a number of activities, sort of new contract award activities, that are out there that will certainly impact the total -- or could impact the total awards number for the year. The challenge we continue to see in the awards environment, as you know, is you get an award and it gets protested until you kind of hold back on that. But when I look at both AS and ES, they continue to have large opportunities, competitive opportunities, in addition to the ongoing award cycles in front of them. And it's both domestic and international that -- where we see those opportunities. One of the things that we pointed out, I think, on our first call this year was our outlook for 2013 as an increasing international content in our business. International always takes longer than you hope it might, but we do see it on a positive trajectory in the enterprise. So I hope that helps to some extent. I know I didn't answer your question quantitatively, but I don't feel we're in a position to do that right now.
Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: I do understand that. Maybe just if you could give -- if you characterize one part of this, which is the uncertainty that you have and the reason you don't want to answer the question yet. Is it more the competitive items that are out there? Or is it the timing of the follow-on items, whether they flip out of the year or not?
Wesley G. Bush: It's both. Even the follow-on things are being slowed down just because the system is operating more slowly. So it is both aspects of that. And on the follow-on things, obviously, in general, it's usually not a matter of whether it's going to happen. It's usually a matter of when. But as the customers are going through their internal debates on priorities, it is challenging for them to go on and get out there with those decisions.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of William Loomis with Stifel, Nicolaus.
William R. Loomis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Looking at Information Systems, so looking at the backlog write-down, just tell me if I'm looking at this right, if I had it back to second quarter backlog, it says that you had roughly a one-to-one book-to-bill in Information Systems in the second quarter. Am I looking at that right?
James F. Palmer: Will, I don't recall the numbers, but I think it was around 90%.
William R. Loomis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. So, I mean, that's still a very good number given awards...
James F. Palmer: A lot of gross awards, yes.
Wesley G. Bush: Gross awards, yes.
William R. Loomis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Yes. That's a good number considering that award activity has been relatively light. What does that say -- what prompted you to write down the backlog and then you obviously had good awards in the second quarter?
James F. Palmer: We try to, on an ongoing basis, look at our backlog. And as you might imagine, the most variability is in the shorter-cycle business, particularly in those areas that have ID/IQ contracts, which, by their very nature, provide some level of flexibility or variability on the actual amount of revenue that you recognize from each of those individual TASC orders. Just to reiterate, ID/IQ means indefinite delivery, indefinite order. So there's variability associated with it. So yes, in this environment, we try to look at any kind of activity that may have potential for an adjustment, and we make those as soon as we know about them.
William R. Loomis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: And to be clear, you are putting feeling in that figure before? You were just looking at awarded TASC orders, and that's what you wrote down?
James F. Palmer: Correct. Correct.
William R. Loomis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then any -- and you had good awards in the second quarter there. What do you see in the second half? I mean, typically, we see in the September quarter on the short cycle side pretty robust period. Is there anything that you've seen to date that you think differently about that?
James F. Palmer: I think we all have been speculating about what might happen here at the last quarter of the government fiscal year, but it would be simply that, speculation. And so I think I'll just leave it as we have that issue every year. Will it be different this year? It's really hard to say whether or not it will be any different.
William R. Loomis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then separately, just -- if you can just review on Global Hawk specifically, just the different variants where we stand now, not in terms of where Congress is but where you are in terms of production and revenue and kind of visibility based on what's funded in hand now.
Wesley G. Bush: So on Global Hawk, the kind of remaining issue out there is the Lot 11 [ph], the Block 30, and we're in active discussions with the Air Force on that.
William R. Loomis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: But you're still completing prior orders?
James F. Palmer: Yes.
Wesley G. Bush: Yes, absolutely. Yes.
James F. Palmer: Yes, not finished.
Wesley G. Bush: Yes.
William R. Loomis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. And that will continue -- you have visibility on that through '14 completing those orders?
Wesley G. Bush: There's a staging of what those orders look like, some this year, some over next year, but there's really been no change in that.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.
Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: So the one pattern I think we're seeing in the industry is that short-cycle businesses, the revenues are under more pressure, generally. Margins are under more pressure, and the weapon systems seem to be basically knocking it out of the park. As those longer-cycle businesses come under more pressure, should we expect greater pressure on your margins? So to the question of the margins just continue to get better and better beyond everyone's expectations, what's it going to take to continue that? If we do see sequester impact on the top line, will that start to throttle those margins back? Is that the key variable?
James F. Palmer: Cai, as I think about this, the nature of our business is both some longer-cycle and shorter-cycle businesses. In the longer-cycle businesses, as Wes alluded to earlier, we have the ability to work off of our backlog. And to the extent that we don't have any unexpected surprises, so program cancellations or terminations, the nature of the contracting process normally provides you with some visibility on where the customer intends to go in the future. My point simply is, in those types of businesses, you have a longer period of time to react to what may occur. We also made a comment -- had made a comment for a number of quarters now that we've been conscious about trying to take cost reduction actions in advance of where we thought the market, our customer was going. And so we've realized that benefit on our existing contract backlog. As we negotiate new contracts, they will be negotiated based on our current cost structure, and it will be harder to maintain the margins that we are realizing today out of the existing backlog. That's the natural ebb and flow of the business.
Wesley G. Bush: Cai, I would also offer one other perspective. It's perhaps a little bit tangential, but I think it's important in a broader view. The nation took a procurement holiday for strategic systems in the 1990s. Over the last decade, we've been largely focused on dealing with the issues surrounding terrorism around the globe and have really not still been able to recapitalize our platform infrastructure in any meaningful way. We have an aging platform capability as a country. And we are going to have to replace that. Things just don't last forever. And so if there is any forcing function to continue a support for, I think, kind of the class of weapons capabilities that you were mentioning, I think that's actually an important strategic one. Now what will the sequester do to that? And what decisions might the department be forced to make? Hard to tell. But that is a real force that's out there right there today. And I think it needs to be understood as a driving factor in the decision space here.
Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: But essentially, what you're referring to is whether or not we're going to have more production programs as the mix, more production programs than development programs?
Wesley G. Bush: Exactly right. Exactly right.
James F. Palmer: [indiscernible] point in time.
Wesley G. Bush: Yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Wes, I wanted to ask, not really ask, but just get your perspective on this EAC question and margin issue a different way and sort of apply it to capital deployment. I wonder what the observation of the improvements you've seen in performance over the last couple of years now tells you about what the performance must have been 3 to 5 years ago, which is sort of the last time these stocks were at these levels. And when you think about in the intrinsic value of these companies, Wes, we get several of both your stock, the stocks of your peers at levels that are now once again on all-time highs. How do you think about the intrinsic value of the firm and that of your peers now that you've improved the performance? I mean, obviously, the profit policy hasn't changed. The budget's lower. So does it sort of make the case that, intrinsically, the companies were much poorer at their old prior highs and now they're much better and it still makes a lot of sense to buy back stock here? I'm just interested in your perspective.
Wesley G. Bush: You have to look at it, I think, from a number of different angles. Clearly, the marketplace makes some decisions around EBITDA multiples. And if you kind of look at that historically, I think that's illuminating. And I know a number of folks on the call that looked at EBITDA versus EBITDAP as better predictors over time. But if you look at that historically, you'd say, "Well, we're probably actually in a reasonable place with the value opportunity that's still in front of us." So when we think about share repurchases, and I've said this a number of times on our calls. We think about it over the long term, the long-term value of the enterprise, how we see ourselves generating cash, how we see ourselves with the ability to deploy that cash both internally to create longer-term value and directly to the benefit of our shareholders. And all of those things go into our thinking around the core economics of doing share repurchase. Obviously, we've concluded it makes sense. We've been pretty vocal about that. And it actually stated a goal for where we would drive our share repurchase activities here through the -- over the next couple of years. So everybody takes a little bit of a different view on this, but I think you can be informed by looking at it from a couple of different angles. But fundamentally, it comes back to how you see the long-term performance and portfolio of the enterprise and how that aligns with the nation's needs and the needs of our allies. And that's really the core of our thinking.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division: And do you think it's correct to say that it implies that the understanding of what performance was possible 5 years ago, let's say, is very different today than what it was then?
Wesley G. Bush: I'd hate to try and Monday morning quarterback what happened a number of years ago in the marketplace. I know there were a lot of different factors in play then, but all I can do is sort of snapshot my view of where we are and what I think our future looks like. And that's really the framework for decision-making.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Can we focus a bit on the specific of the F-35? And obviously, you moved into LRIP 5 here. It's adding nicely, too, on the top line. It presumably is not dilutive to the margin either. So I was hoping you could comment. 5, 6 and 7, I think, are roughly the same quantities. It would imply that you're not going to have much of a revenue growth rate, but I'm curious of the margin potential over the next several LRIPs. Is there a lot of margin potential, number one? And the second piece of it is, how much of those contracts are fully definitized at this point?
Wesley G. Bush: So Myles, let me say a few words, and then -- and Jim certainly can add in. And you're right, the LRIPs are pretty flat in terms of the number of units being built. So I think over the next near-term period of time, we're going to see F-35 continue to kind of be where it is. And we're still in LRIP land, obviously. We're not into whole rate production and the multi-year productions. And so inherently, the margin rates during development and even LRIP are not what the potential margin rates could be later on as we move forward into the program. I hope we're going to be able to start up that curve in a more meaningful way, but we do have to get all the things done that are necessary at this stage of the program to be able to achieve that. I think we're making really good progress on this program. And I would give credit to Lockheed Martin. I think they're doing a great job as the prime on this. I think we have a really good team with Lockheed and Northrop and BAE Systems and Pratt & Whitney all together on this. We are working together on it in a very, I would say, highly aligned, team-oriented way with our customer community. So I am of a mind that this program is making really good progress, and I'm proud to be on this team. I think it's got some really good future in front of it. Now, how does it get interfered with potentially by all of this budget challenge that's in front of us? I don't know. That's a hard one to call. But the job we have in the industry is to continue to drive to make it more affordable and to demonstrate the extraordinary capabilities of this aircraft and that alignment with what not only the U.S. needs but all of our partner nations need. And I see an increasing alignment around that on this program. So number one, really important, but as you point out, these LRIPs are sort of going to hold us flat for a while until we can get up a more substantial production curve. And over time, I would hope to see the margins come with that.
James F. Palmer: Just to add, Myles, based on the planned quantities that we see ahead of us for all the LRIPs, we really don't see F-35 revenues ramping until about 2016. And as Wes just said, the team's -- the entire team's focus is really on driving affordability, how do we get unit cost down. We all recognize that that is going to be an important factor in being able to realize the quantities that are ahead of us. So a lot of focus on how to drive affordability, reduce cost, improve performance, deliver on time.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: And the margin potentially across the 3 LRIPs, is it roughly the same? Or is there pressure to the downside as you move out at flat quantities and customer wanting lower prices?
James F. Palmer: I wouldn't -- I don't know that it's worthwhile commenting on margins by individual programs at this point in time. We're really working hard to drive...
Wesley G. Bush: Yes, this is really about -- this is about affordability.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I wanted to go back to the share repurchase conversation, a little bit more just on the mechanics of that in the near and medium term. So when you announced it, you had said you could issue debt to buy back stock at a faster rate. You've then added some debt not long after that. Was that what you're referring to? Or could we see more balance sheet capitalization changes? And then given you did that, should we look for a faster pace of buyback in the back half of the year? Should we specifically be looking for ASRs? Anything you can give to help us there would be great.
James F. Palmer: We make all of those decisions essentially every quarter. And looking at the pace of our share repurchase program, we did, as you pointed out, go to the capital markets and raised some additional debt and net of $2 billion to increase our overall financial flexibility. We could use some of that cash for accelerating share repurchases, but essentially, our message was around the -- our goal to reduce our share count by about 60 million shares or 25% by the end of 2015. Make it real simple. That's 11 quarters, kind of like 5.5 million shares per quarter on a pro rata basis. And we can do that on a pro rata basis. We can do it on an accelerated basis. We have the flexibility, the financial resources to think about what makes the most sense and each time that we address a new program. Could we do ASRs? Yes, it's a possibility. It's something that we look at on a regular basis to see whether or not we make -- whether it makes sense. No commitment to any kind of formal transaction at this point in time.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And is it pro rata that's in the updated 2013 earnings guidance?
James F. Palmer: The guidance for 2013 was based on weighted average share reduction of 7%. We still expect to get a 7% reduction. On a weighted average basis, it's going to be really hard, given that we're halfway through the year to having meaningful change in that average for the year. So I still feel really good about the overall 7% reduction for the year. Our guidance anticipates that.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Crédit Suisse.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: I just wanted to go back to IS, a follow-on to Bill's question earlier, and the discussion about short cycle. Wes, in the past, you've characterized your IS business as being a little less commoditized perhaps than others, but it seems like the pressure is still pretty strong there. And particularly on the margins, Jim, you did mention fewer EACs and a couple of other things, but is this a trend that continues? I know you've said the margins reverse a bit here in the second half, but we really -- we haven't bottomed here in the short-cycle pressure. So how should we think about this going forward and into next year?
Wesley G. Bush: So Rob, let me make a little bit of a distinction because I think sometimes this gets lost in the communication. When we talk about commoditized, we talk about the way the market operates. So if there are many players, and it is essentially a race to the $0.05 or to the $0.01 contract-by-contract, that's commoditized. That means that you're really having difficulty competing on the basis of technical differentiation or knowledge or intellectual property. That's the framework we mean with commoditized. Short cycle, some commoditized businesses, most commoditized businesses probably are short cycle, but those 2 are not fully overlapping circles in the Venn diagram. When we think about short-cycle businesses, we mean those business which inherently have shorter-term contracts. Those may or may not be commoditized. In fact, many of our short-cycle businesses are businesses that take extraordinary engineering skills to perform, rely on our ability to provide intellectual property and an experience base that simply is not commoditized. But yet, they are still short cycle by nature of the way that customer buys. So I just would want to make sure that those 2 don't get confused in the dialogue. And we have, in fact, moved away and have been doing this now for a number of years from those businesses that we see as more commoditized, because we don't see that that's necessarily a place where it makes sense for us to invest a lot of our time and energy and resources. We have focused in IS and more across the board in those areas where the differentiation occurs on the basis of the intellectual capital that can be brought to whatever the particular competition might be, which inherently shrinks the field of competitors. And, in fact, if you look at that smaller field that we tend to go after more on the system side of this, I think you'll see in the marketplace that has all of these earnings releases have been coming out, they were all kind of having the same experience, that because a lot of that type of capability is purchased on these ID/IQ contracts, the customer has a lot of flexibility to throttle up or throttle down. And given the budget uncertainties, we're seeing more throttle down than throttle up in that space right now. So from a strategic perspective, we're on the track that we've talked about. We continue to focus our portfolio in the areas where we see our ability to be differentiated as creating longer-term value. But we're going through a budget environment that is, for these shorter-cycle components of that, causing this type of variation.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: So Wes, are you saying that what we're seeing here in IS is not pricing-related? Because it's not -- this is about demand in volume and periods of softness.
Wesley G. Bush: Yes, I would characterize it as a market condition, not so much a competitiveness perspective, because the work that we've been doing in IS, I'm convinced, has us in a very competitive position. So it's more about what we're seeing in the market.
James F. Palmer: Rob, a couple of other perspectives on this. In my prepared comments, I talked about a $27 million adjustment or reduction in favorable adjustments. I also mentioned commercial contract revenue timing, a smaller impact, as well as the ramp-down of in-theater programs. Frankly, a big part of that $27 million reduction in favorable adjustments is a result of some adjustments in last year's second quarter, resulting from immediate needs on production-type products in-theater.
Wesley G. Bush: Right. There was...
James F. Palmer: I don't anticipate that those would always be there. Margins of almost 11% last year in IS in the second quarter, well above what we consider to be the benchmark for this type of business. Performance on a year-to-date basis in IS basically in line with, again, what we see as the benchmark for this business. So, frankly, I think you're seeing an anomaly more in last year's favorable performance than an unfavorable performance in this year.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: But even so, you're talking about a lower margin in the second half than you addressed in the first half.
James F. Palmer: No. We're basically saying consistent with the 6 months margin in the second half of the year with the first half.
Wesley G. Bush: Which is consistent with the benchmark that we see for the business.
James F. Palmer: Yes.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And by the way, Jim, on that, do you see EACs -- are they -- could they continue to trend down as this is a business where just maybe the maturity of the contract base suggests that's going to be a lower portion of your profit going forward?
James F. Palmer: Frankly, if we're again still talking about IS, the IS, being a short-cycle business, the amount of the adjustments that they traditionally have is relatively small.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: So this really is an anomaly? Or last quarter was an anomaly?
James F. Palmer: Last year's second quarter was much more.
Wesley G. Bush: I think so.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And then just while we're on the topic, the other businesses, which are more long cycle and have more EACs, Wes or Jim, are we at a point -- given that the new starts are fewer and farther between and programs are closing out, just how do you see those trending EACs?
Wesley G. Bush: Our objective is to win every new start we can that makes sense that's going to be profitable. So if we're successful in that regard, that inherently will hold the margin rates down a little bit. So just in terms of our desires for our business, we like winning.
Stephen C. Movius: Well, this concludes the Q&A session. We ran over a little bit because we couldn't quite get to everybody. So I apologize to those that are still in the queue. I will be at my office to answer additional questions. At this point in time, I would like to turn the call over to Wes for final comments.
Wesley G. Bush: I'll just say thank you again, everyone, for your continuing interest in our company. I'd also like to say thank you to the team here at Northrop Grumman for continuing to work so hard on performance and delivering value to our shareholders. I'd also like to say thank you to our customer community. They are dealing with an extraordinarily difficult set of challenges. I really admire and respect how they are dealing with it. It is not a situation that any of us should be putting them in as they work so hard to defend our nation. So we ought to all keep that in mind as we go forward and hopefully find some resolution to these challenges. Thank you, everyone.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. Have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's First Quarter 2013 Conference Call. My name is Sheverly, and I will be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Steve Movius, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Movius, please proceed.
Stephen C. Movius: Thanks, Sheverly, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's First Quarter 2013 Conference Call. We do not have a PowerPoint presentation for the first quarter. However, we are posting an updated company overview that provides supplemental information on our 4 sectors. You can access our new company overview at www.northropgrumman.com. Before we start, please understand that matters discussed on today's call constitute forward-looking statements, pursuant to Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which are detailed in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risk factors may cause actual company results to differ materially. On the call today are Wes Bush, our Chairman, CEO and President; and Jim Palmer, our CFO. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Wes.
Wesley G. Bush: Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Our first quarter performance demonstrates that our team's focus on affordability, cost competitiveness and program performance continues to generate solid results. This was another good quarter, and I'm very proud of the track record that our team has built. Despite slightly lower sales, first quarter earnings per share increased 4% to $2.03. The combination of strong operating performance from all 4 of our businesses and share repurchases drove this quarter's EPS growth. Our first quarter sales declined by approximately $100 million or 1.5%. Sales for our short-cycle businesses, Information Systems and Technical Services, declined by approximately $200 million, which was partially offset by a $100 million sales increase at Aerospace Systems, our longest-cycle business. Jim will discuss trends within each sector, but generally speaking, top line pressure in our short-cycle businesses reflects federal budget turmoil, continuing in-theater force reductions and our own portfolio-shaping actions. Information Systems was most impacted by the pervasive budget uncertainty in the first quarter and the restrictive nature of the continuing resolution that expired on March 27. Segment operating margin rate was strong at 12.3%, and we reduced our year-over-year weighted average shares outstanding by 7%. During the quarter, we repurchased 6.5 million shares of our stock for approximately $431 million. At the end of the first quarter, approximately $1 billion remained on our share repurchase authorization. First quarter cash from operations improved year-over-year, and free cash flow improved by approximately $150 million. We ended the quarter with a total backlog of $39.4 billion, which reflects new awards of $4.7 billion or a 77% book-to-bill. First quarter book-to-bill was impacted by our customers' reluctance or inability to award contracts or task orders. Sequestration and the restrictive CR were significant overhangs. And most major contract negotiations are taking longer due to the numerous issues our customers have to address in today's environment. During the quarter, we announced several actions to ensure further alignment with our customers' need for increasing affordability, innovation and cost competitiveness. We're establishing Aerospace Design Centers of Excellence in Florida, California and New York for manned and unmanned aircraft and electronic attack. We're also establishing 2 Aircraft Integration Centers of Excellence in Palmdale, California and St. Augustine, Florida. These actions are aimed at focusing and leveraging capabilities in our key areas of manned aircraft and unmanned systems. Taking a Center of Excellence approach will allow us to preserve knowledge and critical skills across a changing program base. We're continuing to close and consolidate numerous facilities across the company. These actions are aimed at improving our cost competitiveness by reducing our facility's footprint and leveraging our enterprise-wide capacity in the most efficient and cost-effective manner. Looking ahead, we now have a fiscal year 2013 appropriations bill in place. Sequestration, of course, is now in effect, and our customers are in the process of making the programmatic decisions necessary to comply with the reduced budget levels. I'd also note that the President has submitted a fiscal year 2014 budget. The administration's budget does not include sequestration, highlighting the importance of continuing to adequately fund our national security efforts. However, if Congress does not take legislative action to avoid the continuation of sequestration, approximately $50 billion in additional spending reductions will be required in FY 2014. In addition to these budget considerations, Secretary Hagel's review of National Defense strategy is expected at the end of May. This review may inform additional programmatic decisions, as well as the upcoming quadrennial defense review. All of this is creating a high degree of turmoil as our customers navigate these budget crosscurrents. We share the concerns of our Pentagon leadership that damage to national security may be irreversible under a prolonged sequestration. With few exceptions, we were pleased to see that the President's fiscal year 2014 budget supported many of our largest programs. Funding for the E-2D Advanced Hawkeye was increased 25%. 21 EA-18G Growlers were requested at roughly double last year's funding. F-35 units were maintained, and space programs like SBIRS, Advanced EHF and the James Webb Space Telescope were sufficiently funded. We believe it is important that the budget provides $13 billion for cyber-related activities. The Department of Defense designated Cybersecurity as a key investment area and increased funding in this area by more than 20% to $4.7 billion. We were also pleased the budget continues to support Global Hawk Block 30 and Block 40 operations for the Air Force. Our high-altitude, long-endurance unmanned franchise continues to be well-positioned in both the domestic and international markets. Growth in our domestic efforts will be driven by the Navy's Triton program. And on the international front, we are ramping up on NATO AGS and continuing our efforts on Germany's EURO HAWK. Turning to our financial outlook for the remaining of the year, we're confirming the guidance we provided in January. We now have an appropriations bill in place. We have received some specific sequestration-related program directives. To date, these are not large amounts in the aggregate, and they are being offset by more positive trends in other areas. So without additional definitive action on specific programs, our prior guidance represents our current estimate of this year's financial results, although we recognize uncertainty remains regarding the implementation of sequestration. While we are not yet able to determine all program-specific impacts, we expect the reduced FY 2013 budget levels will result in lower 2013 awards, and the related impacts to company revenues, earnings and cash flows likely will trail the reduced awards. We continue to expect sales of approximately $24 billion, EPS of $6.85 to $7.15, cash from operations of $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion and free cash flow of $1.7 billion to $2 billion before discretionary pension contributions. So now I'll turn the call over to Jim for a more detailed discussion of results and guidance. Jim?
James F. Palmer: Thanks, Wes, and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. My comments will focus on the first quarter results and, of course, our 2013 guidance. As Wes said, another very solid quarter. Our employees continue to focus on performance and execution in a very difficult and demanding environment, and I want to add my congratulations to our team for a job very well done. Turning to the sectors. Aerospace Systems sales increased 4% or about $100 million. The single largest driver was the higher F-35 volume. You might recall that the F-35 program transitioned to the units of delivery accounting method beginning with LRIP 5. We delivered the first LRIP 5 units in last year's third quarter. This quarter, first quarter of 2013, we had 10 LRIP 5 deliveries compared with no LRIP 5 deliveries in last year's first quarter. AS also had higher unmanned revenues this quarter as the NATO AGS and Fire Scout programs ramped up. These positive trends were partially offset by a decline in space programs. I view AS first quarter operating margin rate of 10.9% as supportive of our low- to mid-11% guidance for the year. And we continue to expect sales of approximately $9.7 billion for the year at AS. Turning to Electronic Systems. First quarter sales were comparable to last year. In-theater force tempo reduced infrared countermeasures and laser systems revenues by about $40 million. Program completions in combat avionics and maritime systems reduced revenues by about another $60 million. These impacts were essentially offset by higher volumes for international and space programs. Operating income on an absolute basis was down 3%, but margin rate was again outstanding at 17.2%. You'll recall that in last year's first quarter, we noted that ES had an unusually high level of net favorable adjustments, particularly in combat avionics. Net favorable adjustments at ES declined by $62 million this quarter but were partially offset by the reversal of a $26 million non-programmatic risk reserve. The remainder of the improvement reflects higher overall margin rates resulting, in part, from last year's performance improvements. Obviously, it's early in the year and most of this year's risk and opportunities are still ahead of us, but I expect that there may be some modest upside to the current guidance for ES sales and margin rate. Information Systems first quarter sales declined by 9%, with the single largest item in that decline being the $25 million transfer of intercompany efforts to our Enterprise Shared Services organization. Before that item, sales declined by about 8% due to lower volume across a broad number of programs. No single program accounted for a material amount of the total decline. Operating income declined as a result of lower sales and a lower level of net favorable adjustments than in the prior year. Although margin rate declined, it was still strong at 10.2%. And at this point in the year, we are maintaining our sales guidance of approximately $6.7 billion, with an operating margin rate in the mid to high 9%s, although there is likely some modest downside sales risk of the uncertain impacts of sequestration on this short-cycle business. Moving to Technical Services. First quarter sales declined by 4%, operating income declined by 7%, portfolio shaping impacted sales by about $30 million and lower ICBM and KC-10 volume impacted sales by about another $40 million. These declines were partially offset by higher volumes for new programs awarded in 2012. Operating income reflects lower sales and an operating margin rate comparable to prior year. We continue to expect sales of about $2.7 billion with a mid to high 8% margin rate. First quarter segment operating margin rate on an overall basis was 12.3% compared to 12.7% in last year's first quarter. This reflects a $91 million decline in net favorable adjustments in the quarter. About 2/3 of that change was in Electronic Systems, but as I noted earlier, that was partially offset by this $26 million reserve reversal. The remaining performance improvement reflects, as I said earlier, the higher booking rates across our portfolio, resulting from, at least in part, last year's EAC adjustments. I would also note that we had a lower tax rate this quarter. As you are aware, the American Taxpayer Relief Act reinstated the research tax credits for 2012 and 2013. So this quarter's lower effective tax rate reflects about $20 million benefit for those credits this quarter. That amount includes the full effect of 2012 credits and 1 quarter of expected 2013 credits. Cash from operations improved by about $100 million compared to last year, and as I think many of you know, our first quarter cash flow is typically the lowest of the year. As Wes indicated, we are maintaining our guidance from cash from operations and free cash flow. And I would remind you that all those estimates are before the after-tax impact of any discretionary pension contributions. And shortly after the quarter-end, we made a $500 million discretionary contribution to our pension plans. These tax-efficient contributions avoid any future funding spikes and continue to be an effective use of our cash. I would note that over the last 10 years, our average annual planned investment returns have exceeded our long-term expected rate of return by well over 100 basis points. That superior investment performance has positively impacted our funded status, reduced future CAS cost and improved affordability and, I believe, provides a competitive advantage. Before we move to Q&A, I'd just like to add my perspective on 2013 sales guidance, as we said last year or last quarter, our initial 2013 guidance did not assume sequestration. And as Wes noted, to date, sequestrated-related downside sales risks haven't been that significant and have generally been in our short-cycle business. I would characterize those reductions as pretty much consistent with our expectations in a declining budget environment. So -- and to date, the reductions that we have seen have been largely offset by positive trends at Electronic Systems. So in thinking about this, barring any specific program cancellations or terminations, we don't expect fiscal 2014 budget debate or the results of Secretary Hagel's strategic review to significantly impact our 2013 sales. So given those assumptions, we have maintained our 2013 sales guidance. Steve, I think at this point, we're ready to take any questions.
Stephen C. Movius: Thanks, Jim. [Operator Instructions] So Sheverly, we're ready to begin.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies LLC.
Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Wes, I want to talk for a second about UAVs, and this a little bit of a fine point. But the FY '13 budget approved the -- or supported the Block 30 Global Hawk. And the commentary outside of what Congress has appropriated would say the program has problems, and you can see that accordingly in the FY '14 budget. Could you sort of address -- I mean, obviously, some of your commentary did, but could you put a little bit more of a fine point on this? If the funding is there, then won't you get it?
Wesley G. Bush: Yes, Howard, thanks for the question. Let me just kind of back up and talk about Block 30 a little bit more broadly. We continue to be pleased, and I think the customer continues to be very pleased with the in-theater performance of the Block 30 systems. They're in very high demand. They're running at a very high utilization rate. The combatant commanders don't seem to be able to get enough of them. So that's the -- sort of the operational reality of what's going on with Block 30 today. We're in this interesting period of time where the nation is having to make some decisions around budgets, and the departments are feeling very squeezed on their ability to fit everything in and meet all the demands of both the Congress, if you will, from a budgetary perspective, as well as the operational commanders out there in the theater. So inevitably, there are decisions or recommendations put forward for budgetary consideration that the Congress has to debate and make decisions on. And Block 30, I think, is sort of a classic example of that. In particular, it is a brand-new system. And so when you do the calculation on the cost component, brand-new systems take a little bit of time to work their operating costs down the curve, down the operating cost curve. And if you're in a budgetary mode where you're trying to squeeze everything in for the next year and you're not all the way down that curve, it's easy to come up with a different conclusion. And so that's where Congress has responsibility to look at things both near term and long term. And we saw that in this last cycle where Congress took a view of sort of the longer term, given the investment that's been made in Block 30. So we were very pleased to see the continued support for Block 30 in the actions that Congress took with the 2013, both the authorization and the appropriation process. But at the same time, the Air Force has real budget pressures, and that's a reality the Air Force is having to work their way through. This turns out to be more about the cost of operating than it really does in terms of the remaining procurement. If you look at the last of the lots of Block 30 to be put on contract, that will be Lot 11, there's really only 3 more aircraft in that Lot 11. So the budget math here has to go to what it takes to sustain this system in its operations. And so that's on us. We have got to work with the Air Force to continue to address the cost of operating Block 30s. We're doing that. We're putting forward some proposals, recommendations for the Air Force to consider. But I think it's simply a reflection of this budget environment that we're in, that's forcing a decision space that's perhaps more narrow. And we all might want it to be given the longer-term perspective of capabilities for the nation.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi.
Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Wes, I would like to dive a little bit deeper on the comment that you made about 2014 and the fact that the impact of sequester is kind of marginal this year but that what we ought to be really focused on with sequester is 2014, and more importantly, that revenues and earnings are going to kind of follow the bookings rate. So kind of leads logically to your expectations around book-to-bill through this year and how you think that, that actually translates into the trajectory as we move out into 2014, keeping in mind that you'll, of course, be able to continue to draw on the backlog that you already have. But just any more granularity that you can offer on 2014, I think, would be helpful for everybody on the call.
Wesley G. Bush: Thanks, Jason. I think it actually might be helpful just to step back and remind everybody of the mechanics here because that really turns into the outcome. So I think we're all trying to sort our way through. And the analogy I would use would be how does the pig move through the snake? Although in this case, I wouldn't want to impugn the population of pigs by calling them a sequester. So maybe it's the rat moving through a snake or something. It's a delayed effect approach. The sequester reduced the amount of money that Congress allows to be committed by the Department of Defense and by the other federal agencies. So it really starts there. The in-year effect of the sequester is a reduction in the department's ability to obligate fundamentally. That reduction takes some time to translate into revenue impacts as the department actually has to turn a reduced level appropriations into specific contractual commitments. And then those contractual commitments, once they're made, they play out over the life of the contracts as revenues. So that creates this delayed effect in realizing the impact on revenues resulting from the sequester. And if you kind of stand back and look at the different types of businesses in our company and in our industry, the shorter-cycle businesses will realize this effect the first, of course, because that delay effect is shorter. And the longer-cycle businesses will see it over a longer period of time. And I think as you reflected in your question, awards is really the leading indicator of that effect. And as I think I indicated in my remarks, we expect to see the impacts on revenue, earnings and, of course, cash flows trail that impact on awards over time. And as I think Jim mentioned, when we were thinking about our guidance, obviously, we're having to reflect the best knowledge that we have today. That guidance does assume that the sequester does not result in cancellations or terminations of our significant programs. But clearly, there's still uncertainty regarding the ultimate impact of the sequester, particularly as we look out into next year. And I think your question went to, what should we be thinking about in terms of the effects on awards and book-to-bill? I wish I knew. We have yet to see that as we go through this year. I think the real test will be what does the third and fourth quarter of this year look like? So essentially, the last quarter of this fiscal year and the first quarter of the new fiscal year. That will inform us a lot. It certainly will inform us on how 2014 will look. And it's very likely that this is going to negatively impact sales in 2014. I'll say it as clearly as I can in that regard. To think that the sequester somehow just dissipates and goes away and doesn't impact the future is putting your head in the sand. So we expect there will be some continuing impact over time. The magnitude of that impact in 2014 is hard to predict. As I indicated, we've got a bunch of things in front of us. We have to work our way through the actual implementation of the current sequester. We have the debt ceiling issues in front of us over the course of the summer, which may or may not impact the outcome for the budgets for next year and how Congress deals with the President's budget that was put forward. And we also have in front of us the overall strategy review that Secretary Hagel has launched, which is standing back to take kind of a broader look at the national strategy in light of overall budget constraints. So obviously, it would be a little bit foolish to try and speculate on how that works out for 2014. But in aggregate, given the impact of the sequester this year, I think it's fair to project that it will have a negative impact on 2014 revenues.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein.
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: I wanted to follow on that because when you look at your shorter-cycle businesses, particularly on the Information Systems side, backlogs did come down in Q1. And you've been very clear for some time that this is where you could see more of an effect. And then if we head into sequestration, my assumption would be that there could be some impact in '13 and then more in '14. When you take apart that business, where are you seeing the most maybe downside in Q1 or the most risk going forward, either in terms of customer, civil, defense, intel or business type? Can you characterize that a little bit?
James F. Palmer: Yes, Doug, this is Jim. As I said in my comments, really, the declines we saw this year or this quarter, quarter-over-quarter, were across the broad portfolio of programs. I don't know that I would characterize it as necessarily in 1 particular area or not. Again, I think as we all know, this the shortest cycle business we have. It's likely to be the first impacted. And it's probably also likely to be the first that starts to turn up when there is an upturn.
Wesley G. Bush: I do think there are some effects in there that probably flow through before others. We know -- I think everyone is aware that the O&M budgets are under the most immediate stress. So the components of the IS business that connect to the O&M accounts see it first. The Army budget is also a component of sales, and IS is, I think, probably even under more pressure from a longer perspective, not necessarily quarter-to-quarter but from a longer perspective. So if I had to pick apart sort of the customer community drivers, I would say those are more immediate. But the reality is, as Jim said, all of our customers across the board are dealing with this. There was not real flexibility provided to the department with the [indiscernible] sequester. So it's kind of as we thought it would be should this happen kind of across the board.
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: So intel, civil agencies, DoD, all sort of the same dynamic?
Wesley G. Bush: Yes, they're all having to deal with the sequestered budget amounts, and they're all dealing with it in somewhat different ways. But ultimately, and I'm not just talking about the quarter, I'm talking about our kind of -- our view over the year, we expect to see it manifest kind of across that board.
James F. Palmer: And Doug, to be real clear here, we really haven't seen that large of impacts from sequestration at this point. Largely, the declines that we saw were what we -- I would characterize as expected based on an overall budget decline environment.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol with JPMorgan.
Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Wes, wanted to dig a little more actually into Information Systems. And the backlog decline has been noted, and your comments about that have been noted. Just bigger picture though, this business is going, what I would characterize and maybe you'd disagree, in a direction – an un-Northrop-like direction. You guys have been very clear about your pursuit of profitable business, and we see the margins in that segment. But pricing is getting tougher, and barriers to entry are -- always have been low. How are you thinking about navigating through this environment where, really, the business is going in a different direction from what you like to do with your businesses?
Wesley G. Bush: Yes, Joe, thanks for the question. Our approach to that, and we've been at this now for a few years in IS, has been to step away from the components of that space that are going in the directions that you described. And so part of what you've seen in terms of our top line in IS have been very focused decisions about where we're just not going to be in that part of the market. And as I said, we've been at that for a while. I think you can see the benefit of that thinking in our -- in terms of our operating margin rate because we've been able to continue to generate good margins in the space by being much more selective in the parts of it where we compete. So if I pull that thread a bit, IS has probably more hardware in it than I think most people realize. If you look at the work that we do for the Department of Defense and the communications arena where within IS, we're building the C&I avionics for the Joint Strike Fighter. If you look at actually much of the work that we do for the Army that has hardware in content, those parts of the business certainly require a lot more engineering content, they require intellectual property investment and create positions for us that are not just the sort of commodity IT business framework that is often seen in the space characterized by IS. If you look at the broader systems work that we do, that is generally characterized by also a lot of engineering content, whether we're building large command and control systems. And missile defense is sort of a classic example of the work that we do in IS in that regard. Those areas are classes of businesses that when you compare within our IS sector to other companies, other companies sometimes put that in, something they would call electronics or missile defense or some other nomenclature for the title of the business. So I am not as concerned about what we're seeing in the more commodity part of what I would sort of call the IT services businesses out there because that's a relatively small part of our business. We do have some of that, and we've made decisions to keep pieces of it where it connects to the higher value, sort of longer investment perspective components of the business. So I do wonder sometimes if we're doing ourselves a disservice by calling it information systems. But quite frankly, in terms of what it actually does, it provides information systems to our customer community. And I don't want to re-label it just from – put a different banner on it from a Street perspective. I want to make sure that our team understands their charter and what they're out there to do. But the overall vector for that business, I think, is good over the longer period of time. Clearly, as I said, it is a shorter-cycle business. Most parts of it are. And so we'll see some of those effects sooner. But when I think about this for the long term, I like what I see, I like what we're doing and I think it's going to continue to be an important part of our company.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Crédit Suisse.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Wes, just on the back end of that question, then I have another one, could you characterize, maybe give us a ratio in that business of what you'd call price-sensitive to less price-sensitive?
Wesley G. Bush: Let me ask Steve to do that, Steve Movius. Steve, as most of you know, was formally the CFO of our IS business and I think has a good framework for describing that.
Stephen C. Movius: Yes, I'd be happy to. Information Systems, really look at it in a couple of pieces. One would be kind of services piece with a lot of what I would call high-end engineering content contracts, where we've been with a customer for oftentimes very extended periods of time, quite a bit of that with restricted customers. And I would say that most of our competition in that space are folks that -- kind of the Tier 1 folks that you know pretty well. On the systems side, that's about 60% of our business. And again, that's, by and large, very few of the IT competitors in that space. Again, mostly the Tier 1 guys where you have to have significant capabilities to be able to compete effectively and where the customers' value proposition is more on what you're delivering to them versus particularly a lower hourly rate, so to speak. You might think about it in a services world. So I hope that helps.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: No, it certainly does. Then just, Wes, if I go quickly at another direction. One of your peer companies talked a bit about nondefense adjacencies in a recent earnings call. Could you talk a little bit about where some of your opportunities are and then to any extent that you might be further contemplating portfolio shaping?
Wesley G. Bush: My perspective on adjacencies is it's a perspective that any healthy company should always be looking at its portfolio of capabilities and figuring out how to create value. I think the experience of our industry suggests that the longer you have to stretch out your tape measure to measure how adjacent it is, the less likely it is that you're going to really create value. So you have to be very thoughtful both around the real -- the practical application of the technology and a company's ability to understand and navigate the channels to market. It turns out channels to market is every bit as important as the product that you think you have. So our experience generally has been that there's more value to be gained by partnering effectively with other companies that simply have those channels to market and understand the economics and the consumer, if you will, demands that are in those spaces. So I would say there is a value creation opportunity out there for the broader use of technology. You just have to be very thoughtful about how you pursue that and the degree to which you focus the resource of the company in that direction versus sticking to your knitting.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: But you wouldn't characterize it as a driver of your forward strategy?
Wesley G. Bush: No, I would not. It's more an opportunity space that I would say that we look at, and that comes and goes over time, depending on where those technologies might actually connect. If you turn back the clock to the latter part of the '90s, there was a rapid growth in the telecom space that needed a class of technologies that derived from the defense industry. So a number of companies, ours included, were able to navigate that and creates some meaningful value during that time through some very thoughtful approaches to partnering with other companies to leverage that technology. So it's a little bit dependent on what else is going on in the economy and where the needs are. And that's really, I would say, the way we think about it. We're mindful of it, we look at it, but it's not the primary motivator of our strategy, obviously. We're a global security company, and we keep that in mind.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: I had a question which is, if I just look at your net favorable adjustments and I back those out, it still looks like margins were up kind of 30 basis points from December and about 90 versus last year. So I guess the first question is, really, what do you attribute that real change in performance to as to why the underlying earnings still seems to be better? And then should we use this, call it, $225 million of favorable adjustments as the likely number for the future quarters this year?
James F. Palmer: Yes, Sam, I haven't done your math, but as I noted, earnings adjustments are down this quarter, I would think, to a more, if you will, normal level. Last year, admittedly, was -- had very favorable positive adjustments. Didn't think they would be able to be sustained at that level. Ultimately, the margin rates for the 4 sectors in the company reflected in our overall guidance. I feel comfortable with that. Clearly, we're going to push the organization to do better. Part of the improvement, as I noted, in margin rates is a result of the actions that we've taken over time that allowed us to harvest the benefit on our existing backlog of contracts. We'll realize that benefit over the life of that backlog set of contracts. In a go-forward basis, we'll negotiate new contracts reflecting the current cost at that point in time.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Loomis with Stifel.
William R. Loomis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Thanks for giving the detail on the services. Just kind of staying along that theme, you talked about the impact of sequestration early thought. And then -- but I look at the guidance for the year on both -- looking at the 2 separately, Technical Services and then IS. So on Technical Services, if we look at the guidance for the full year, it was down – actual was down 4%. But it implies other quarters have to be down 13% to 14%. Can you just talk about what the main drivers causing those lower year-over-year comparisons? And then on the other side with IS, given the full year guidance, it looks like it's going to be relatively stable throughout the other remaining 3 quarters. Yet, you talked about how sequestration would impact the shorter-cycle side. So is there things that are happening positively on the IS side to kind of offset that later in the year?
James F. Palmer: Yes. In terms of guidance, you might imagine in this environment, we look at a whole number of -- a whole bunch of possible scenarios that have different sales levels for all the different organizations. And as I do that, look at all those potentials, as I said, I come back to an answer that tells me that our overall guidance is supportive of what may -- what I would expect to happen for the year. Yes, there's going to be some variation among the sectors as we go through the year and get a better clarification around whether or not there's going to be specific programs affected by sequestration. The timing of when those occur will have an impact on this year's sales. But again, on an overall basis, I feel good about the overall guidance. I would point out that TS, for example, there are some programmatic effects that occur this year. The ICBM program will be down on a year-over-year basis, just as part of that programmatic change in the program, and that has been reflected in our thoughts about overall guidance at the beginning of the year for the TS environment, as well as the total company.
Wesley G. Bush: Bill, it's Wes. Let me -- I'll just add to what Jim had to say on this, just one other little piece to think about. And I think this is kind of a broader market perspective. Our customers are clearly feeling the most intensity of the pressure in the near term around the O&M part of the budget. And obviously, the appropriations process tried to relieve a little bit of that, that they went through. But any of the businesses that are tightly connected to the O&M part of the budget, when we think through all the factors that Jim just described, that's a factor that really weighs in to our thought process. If you think about what's going on at DoD itself, they pay for their civilian workforce out of that O&M budget, and they're talking still about having to furlough some folks. And when we're down to that level of furloughing and impacting readiness, we've heard the Secretary of the Air Force talk about just these awful effects of having to stand down training flights. When we're having to make those kinds of decisions as a nation, relative to the impacts of the sequester, it just really makes that part of the budget risk factors stand up for us and makes us even more sensitive to potential decisions our customers might have to make in light of the things that are weighing on them already. So I just think it's important to keep in mind what our customers are having to work their way through in light of this somewhat ridiculous budget situation.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada.
Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Wes, I'd like to follow on from what you just said about the state of play, so to speak. The customer's clearly got a lot of pressure at the moment. I was wondering if you're seeing any of that cascading down to you on maybe the price or terms of contract situation as, obviously, they could save some money, I guess, by the defense industry booking lower margins.
Wesley G. Bush: The way I would characterize that is things are taking longer to get done, and I think part of that is just a reflection of the turmoil that our customers are having to deal with. And there's always a natural inclination to try and push back on the margin rates and other aspects of the contracts. Our approach to that has been, and I don't think we're alone in this, when you're looking at a total cost picture, the place to go to save the money is the 90%, not the 10%; the 90% of cost, not the 10% of fee or whatever the right percentages are on a particular contract. So our approach has been to very aggressively go after cost, cost from a cost structure standpoint and cost from a programmatic standpoint. And I think in the places where we're able to demonstrate to our customer community that we are making progress in that regard, I think that helps this overall discussion immensely. In the areas where the customers aren't satisfied with progress on that, then yes, there is a tougher discussion around what is the appropriate fee or incentive structure to help motivate improvements in overall cost. And so yes, I would say there's more intensity around that. But to-date, I think we've been in a position where we've been able to work with our customer community to get to outcomes that we view as fair.
Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay. Maybe just a fine point on that. Are you seeing the customer potentially trying to transfer more risk in the contracts that you sign up to as a way of perhaps saving some money going forward?
Wesley G. Bush: Each time we get into a discussion around an acquisition approach, the ultimate manifestation of that risk is contract type. And there is, I would say, more intensity around what should be fixed price, what should be fixed price incentive versus cost plus. And I would say we were seeing a little bit of a tilt, I think almost an overcorrection tilt in the direction of fixed price or fixed price incentives for a while. If you look at the communication that Frank Kendall has been putting out and, I would say, all of the service acquisition executives have been working on, I think there's a growing recognition that, that might have gone a little bit too far and that there are really some things that the department really wants to be cost plus or perhaps FPI that were getting pushed towards FFP. So I think there's a natural pendulum sort of cycle that we see in this, and my sense is it's -- there's a little bit of a correction occurring right now. But the pressures of the budget environment do cause individual program offices to have to rethink that and figure out how they actually do their budgeting from a total cost, not just what they're putting on contract but also their margin or their risk assessment. So it's a bigger -- I would say a bigger part of the dialogue, bigger part of the discussion. But again, that's on us as well, that's on the industry and in our company, in particular, to be very clear about what that risk balance is.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.
Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: So a general question. Secretary Hagel has sort of emphasized priority on cyber. Your handout suggests that cyber is about a little under $2 billion out of IS's revenue. Everyone defines cyber business differently. Could you tell us, when you talk of your cyber solutions, what do you have in that number? And what are its prospects for growth and profitability this year and next?
Wesley G. Bush: Yes, Cai, it's Wes. Let me just say sort of broadly, yes, I agree with you, everybody defines cyber somewhat differently. It is one of these fields that's rapidly emerging. And as we all begin to realize, and by we, I include our customer community, the tentacles of cyber and the necessity of connecting it so intimately to other components of the floor structure, I don't think there's going to be an exact, precise definition that everybody can look to and say, "That's an airplane and that's cyber." Right? I think it's going to be one of these things where we're going to have to build our way into a common understanding. So as we have worked our definition of it, it has emerged over time from sort of the initial view that was all about maybe defense and offense in the network domain to now include situational awareness more broadly in the network domain. And then beyond that, it became clear that we needed to embed cyber capabilities into platforms and other systems that we're selling. So there's an embedded component of it. And then I would say, even beyond that, there's a growing recognition of cyber as an integral component and perhaps the right words for basically the broader category of non-kinetic capability that is inclusive of things that may have historically been called electronic warfare. So we are thoughtful in how we look at each piece and how we describe it, but I think what you're seeing from us is more a reflection of the way that we would characterize the components of our portfolio that match to our customers' emerging definition of cyber. And as that definition continues to change, we're going to try and keep up with it and actually help influence the perspectives on those tentacles of cyber. So I apologize if that's not a precise definition for you, but it is a reflection of an evolving field and a field whose tentacles are increasingly intertwined in just about every other component of the defense architecture. So given that, to the second part of your question, growth, I mentioned in my comments that we were pleased to see the amount of funding that is evident in the President's budget for what I would say is more traditional cyber, the definition of defense, offense and situational awareness. But there are components of the President's budget associated with the other parts of the defense infrastructure that are reflective of the need to embed cyber in those as well. So it's probably not going to help from a modeling perspective, what I just said, but I think from an understanding perspective, it's important to recognize that this is going to be a moving target for a while, which I think emphasizes its importance.
Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: I think the question really was, how fast is it growing? I mean, it's a priority, but is it growing? Or is it relatively stable until some event in the future?
Wesley G. Bush: It's growing.
James F. Palmer: It's growing.
Wesley G. Bush: It's growing. It's growing rapidly. And trying to put a number on it would have to pin down the current state definition on any particular day. But it's double-digit growth.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Just since we made it this far in the call and haven't talked about 1 of 2 topics that are so near and dear to your heart, Jim, and -- capital deployment and pension, I figured I'd at least knock one of them out. The guidance explicitly states that you're not considering a debt ceiling breach government shutdown scenario, but obviously, that's a risk you've got to think about, sort of tail risk you got to think about in your planning. When you think about your stance on capital deployment, share repurchase, as we get closer to that, should expect to see some conservatism in how you manage the balance sheet and how you think about share repurchase? Or is that -- are you in a position where you think you can continue the way you have in the past despite that risk?
James F. Palmer: Yes. Carter, I'd characterize -- our approach here is to be mindful of all the risk that are inherent in our business and then the plan for the possibilities that they all may occur; at the same time, to be balanced, if you will, across the -- we don't guide on a quarterly basis, obviously, on share repurchases. So we've talked about our plan for the year. I really don't see a change in that plan at this point in time. I think we're on pace to do that. And at the same time, we're mindful of the potential risk around the debt ceiling situation here in the summer and feel comfortable that we're able to deal with that as well.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Great. Since it's Q1, I'll save the pension question for next quarter.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Wes, I'm going to go to the high level on sequestration one more time. And the only thing I'm trying to get at is, for the last couple of years, 4% organic decline has kind of been, I think, what you've showed, 4% to 5%. And this year, pretty much the whole industry is at 5%. And Jim, I think you qualified that as being more reflective of a general defense spending declining environment. So I'm just kind of curious, are you feeling better about the industry and your, in particular, ability to manage sequestration? Because it seems like they're giving you a lot of lead time to see it coming. And is it just going to turn out to look like an extension of a down cycle?
Wesley G. Bush: Hard to tell yet. The challenge here, obviously, that we're all struggling through in '13 is we've got to deal with a full year sequester in half a year. And so our customers are just really struggling to sort that out. And I have to say, I admire them for how they're managing their way through this because it is so challenging. Trying to predict where this goes on a '14 or '15 basis is difficult from a variety of perspectives that I [indiscernible] before, trying to predict how the FY '14 budget process will work out, trying to predict the results of the strategy review, those are all sort of big challenges. We are managing. And I would say broadly across the industry, we are managing because we are having to scale to go with what's happening. And it's not what we'd prefer to do, but it's what we know how to do and we are going to do it. And having some lead time on decision-making is always helpful so we can try and do this in a way that is most efficient. But ultimately, as I've said very broadly, and I don't want anyone to sort of hear that we're relaxed about this because we are not, the impact of the sequester will have long-term impacts, even if it just gets turned off for '14 and beyond. The fact that we had it this year will have a ripple effect. And if it goes on very long, I think just about anyone in our industry would tell you we are concerned about the impacts on our supply chain and we're concerned about the impacts on our workforce and we're concerned about how long it takes to turn the engines back on when the nation needs it. And history shows, the nation will need it. So I don't want anyone to hear that this is just sort of business as usual, we'll figure it all out and everything will be fine. It's the wrong answer for our country.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: But if you had to make the bet, would '14's decline be an accelerating decline versus '13?
Wesley G. Bush: I'm not going to speculate. It's -- there are a lot -- there are so many factors out there. I think it would be foolish to speculate.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.
George Shapiro: Yes. Two questions, actually. Jim, I was wondering if you could quantify at all the potential cash flow impact from what the Pentagon's talked about of switching for milestone payments to progress payments, and also the effect that's slowing payments that have been accelerated last year for small business.
James F. Palmer: I'll take the second one first. Move away from the so-called quick pay methodology that occurred in the first quarter impacted cash flows by, I would estimate, about $100 million, negatively impacted cash flows by about $100 million. In terms of movement from milestone payments to progress payments, George, you'd have to look at the broad portfolio of programs. It is, as you know, just a timing question. You do get paid. It's just how quickly do you get paid. And so we continue to work these issues on a program-by-program basis, contract-by-contract, if you will. Some progress, sometimes not so good. But again, I feel good about the overall guidance for cash for the year.
George Shapiro: Okay. And then if I might, one for you, Wes. I mean, you talked about trying to focus on the 90% of the cost rather than the profit margin. But as you commented, in an uncertain environment that you're in, where you don't have the same ability to see ahead like you might have had, I mean, how do you manage getting cost down in that environment so it doesn't wind up having an impact on the margins?
Wesley G. Bush: Fundamentally, our biggest lever has been our ability to manage our overhead structure in the company. And as I've said on earlier calls, we've been on a several year path to reduce headcount and reduce facilities, as well as address other components of that cost structure, including pension, that we think have been necessary to help address that. The next phase of it obviously is programmatic. And every program in our company is addressing that in some meaningful way. And ultimately, it depends on the nature of the individual program. So we look at cost in a total composite. We've had, I would say, more flexibility or opportunity in going after the overall cost structure, overhead cost components. But we are being very aggressive on it program by program.
James F. Palmer: George, if I may. If you really think about our business, we are a consolidation, conglomeration of a bunch of programs or contracts. Much of the cost on any of those contracts are people-related cost and supply cost. So the vast majority of our cost is essentially tied to our individual contracts or programs, and we can respond based on what happens to those contracts or programs.
Wesley G. Bush: So it takes a lot of disciplined management across the enterprise.
Stephen C. Movius: I want to thank all of you for your interest in our company. This concludes our Q&A session, and I'd like to turn the call over to Wes for final comments.
Wesley G. Bush: Thanks, Steve. I'd just like to wrap up today by thanking our employees for all that they're doing to ensure that we continue to support the men and women of our military services and our intelligence communities as they deal with this very challenging budget environment. The sequester does have real negative impacts on these great people who serve our country, and it's imperative that we all give them our support. So thanks again for all of you on the call today for your continuing interest in our company. Thanks for joining us.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. Goodbye.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Northrop Grumman Fourth Quarter and Year End Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the call over to Steve Movius, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may proceed.
Stephen C. Movius: Thanks, Frances, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's fourth quarter and year end 2012 conference call. We provided supplemental information in the form of a PowerPoint presentation that you can access at www.northropgrumman.com. Before we start, please understand that matters discussed on today's calls constitute forward-looking statements, pursuant to Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which are detailed in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risk factors may cause actual company results to differ materially. On the call today are our Chairman, CEO and President, Wes Bush; and our CFO, Jim Palmer. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Wes.
Wesley G. Bush: Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We had a very strong finish to the year with outstanding fourth quarter and full year results. We met or exceeded guidance for every metric, and I want to congratulate our employees on a job well done. Fourth quarter earnings per share increased 2% to $2.14; and for the full year, earnings per share rose 5% to $7.81. On a pension-adjusted basis EPS increased 11% in the fourth quarter to $2.06, and 15% for the year to $7.47. Our financial results demonstrate the positive impact of superior program performance driven by cost reductions, affordability initiatives, innovation and portfolio shaping across our 4 businesses. The strength of our sector's operating performance, coupled with continued share repurchases, more than offset lower sales, higher pension expense and higher effective tax rates. Cash generation was also strong. For the year, before the impact of pension prefunding, we generated cash from operations of $2.8 billion and free cash flow of $2.5 billion. On a reported basis, free cash flow of $2.3 billion represents a free cash flow yield of 14.3% and net income conversion of 117%. We deployed that cash by repurchasing 20.9 million shares of our common stock for $1.3 billion, reducing weighted average shares outstanding by 10%. We also paid dividends of $535 million and made a $300 million discretionary pension contribution. Through share repurchases and dividends, we returned more than $1.8 billion in cash to our shareholders or approximately 80% of 2012 reported free cash flow. We captured new awards of $26.5 billion during the year for a book-to-bill of 1.05. Total backlog increased 3% to $40.8 billion and funded backlog increased more than 10% to $25.7 billion. I'm very proud of the performance improvement accomplished by our team. Achieving these improvements has required tough but necessary actions. To put our improvement into perspective, since the end of 2009, sales from our continuing operations have declined about 9% due in part to portfolio shaping. During that same period, our focus on performance has generated a 20% increase in absolute segment operating income, and a 300 basis points expansion in segment operating margin rate or more than a 30% improvement. As a result of this improvement, in combination with effective cash deployment, EPS from continuing operations have grown by a compound annual growth rate of 20%. While superior program performance and portfolio shaping drove much of the improvement, we've also significantly reduced our cost structure. Over the last 4 years, we've reduced our headcount by approximately 17%, and we've reduced our facilities footprint by approximately 12%. As we improved operating income and margin rate, we maintained robust free cash flow and free cash flow conversion. We also monetized assets to create value for shareholders. Over just the past 3 years, we've generated free cash flow of $7 billion, including the $1.4 billion contribution from the HII spinoff. More than 90% of that cash has been distributed to our shareholders, $4.8 billion to repurchase shares and another $1.6 billion for dividends. In addition, we increased the dividend in each of these 3 years. Looking ahead, I can't recall a time of greater uncertainty regarding customer funding levels or government fiscal policy. We continue to operate under a 6-month continuing resolution that expires on March 27, and there is the potential for sequestration on March 1. In addition, other issues such as the debt ceiling raise the possibility of a potential government shutdown. Our nation needs a balanced strategic approached to our fiscal challenges. Blind, indiscriminate budget-cutting is not the answer, but that is exactly what sequestration would entail. We urge Congress to work to avoid the destructive economic impacts, particularly in terms of government and private employment, and the impacts to our national security that would result from a sequester, a prolonged restricted continuing resolution or a government shutdown. Our 2013 financial guidance is based on the assumption that the current 6-month continuing resolution would be immediately followed by appropriations, which, even if in the form of a full year CR, will provide program spending levels that are consistent with those set forth in the President's fiscal year 2013 budget and that support and fund the company's programs. Guidance for 2013 also assumes there is no disruption or shutdown of government operations resulting from a federal government debt ceiling breach or lack of immediate appropriations following the current CR, that sequestration is not triggered and any budgetary approach agreed by Congress to address longer-term spending does not result in significant reductions to our customers' FY '13 budget levels. While we don't have control over these issues and can't predict their ultimate resolution, I believe the work we've done over the last several years on performance, as well as our strong balance sheet, leaves us well prepared for a likely defense spending downturn. For 2013, we expect sales of approximately $24 billion, earnings per share of $6.85 to $7.15, cash from operations of $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion, and free cash flow of $1.7 billion to $2.0 billion. Our top line guidance contemplates a $500 million impact for lower volume on space programs, Joint STARS and the F/A-18; $300 million for the impact of troop drawdowns in overseas contingency operations; $200 million resulting from the current CR impacts; and approximately $100 million each for the ICBM program restructure and portfolio shaping, principally the deemphasis of base and range operations in our Technical Services business and the Park Air Norway divestiture in Information Systems. Beyond that, we expect low single-digit growth for our core capabilities in cyber and unmanned systems. We also expect higher international revenue. In 2012, international revenue, both direct and FMS, totaled approximately 8%. In 2013 with the ramp-up of NATO AGS and other international bookings, we expect international sales to increase to more than 10% of our revenue, and we see continuing opportunities around the globe that our portfolio should allow us to address. In conclusion, our 2012 results demonstrate strong performance in a challenging environment. In order to continue creating shareholder value, we must remain absolutely focused on our key priorities: driving performance, effectively deploying our cash and optimizing our portfolio for the future. Our record these past few years demonstrates we can do this successfully, and I'm delighted to be working with our company's talented team to create long term sustained value. So now I'll turn the call over to Jim for a more detailed discussion of results and guidance. Jim?
James F. Palmer: Thanks, Wes, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I also want to add my congratulations to our team on the outstanding work this year. 2012 results were simply excellent. Our dedicated team again rose to the challenge and performed very well in a tough environment. We continue to make the difficult decisions to reduce cost, improve affordability that are helpful in translating to our record results. Let me give you a few numbers to put our performance into perspective. Segment operating margin rate of 13.5% for the quarter and a record 12.6% for the year. Pension-adjusted operating margin rate of 11.9% for the year, also a record. I'm particularly pleased by the cash our operations generated this year. Wes noted that our free cash flow was $2.3 billion. That means that free cash flow per share was more than $9. Of that amount, we distributed about $7.30 per share through share repurchases and dividends or 80% of free cash flow. Based on our average 2012 share price of $63.63, our cash yield was 14.3%. And in 2012, our shares appreciated 15.5%. As you can see from the guidance, we expect another strong year of cash generation, and we expect to continue our balanced cash deployment strategy that returns a substantial amount of cash to our shareholders. Turning to results for the sectors. Aerospace Systems finished the year on a high note with a 7% increase in fourth quarter sales and slightly higher sales for the year. AS margin rates for the quarter were outstanding at 13.8% and margin rate of 12.2% for the year matched last year's strong performance. AS did book a couple of positive performance adjustments in the quarter in its space programs, neither of which was more than $20 million. For 2013, we expect AS sales of approximately $9.7 billion, with a margin rate of low to mid-11%. The sales trend reflects lower volumes for space programs, Joint STARS and the F-18, which is more than offset by higher volume unmanned programs due to the ramp-up of NATO AGS and Fire Scout. Electronic Systems also had outstanding results. While fourth quarter and full year sales experienced a mid-single-digit decline, operating margin rate increased 28% for the quarter and 11% for the year. Margin rate was outstanding at 18.5% for the quarter and 17.1% for the year, records for both periods. ES fourth quarter net performance adjustments were about $50 million higher than last year, reflecting solid operational performance, as well as a lower level of negative adjustments for contractual issues. The fourth quarter of 2011 also included some costs from reductions in force. For 2012, ES operating income includes an increase of approximately $160 million in net positive performance adjustments. The increase is driven by 2 factors. First, last year's negative adjustments included about $50 million in our domestic postal automation business that obviously didn't occur this year. And secondly, in 2012, we had a higher level of favorable adjustments, particularly for combat avionics, as well as several programs, completed deliveries, negotiated contract modifications or successfully mitigated risk. For 2013, we expect ES revenues will be roughly comparable to 2012 levels at approximately $6.9 billion. This does contemplate lower volume for some space programs, some continued impact from force reductions in our overseas contingency operations, partially offset by higher international sales. We do expect continued strong margins, but obviously, some of the 2012 performance improvement is likely not sustainable. We expect ES operating margin rates of low to mid-14% for 2013, and while not at the record levels of 2012, they are still very healthy and indicative of outstanding execution at Electronic Systems. Turning to Information Systems, fourth quarter sales declined by 2%, principally due to the divestiture of Park Air Norway in the second quarter of this year. Park Air contributed $30 million in sales in last year's fourth quarter. For 2012, IS sales declined by 7%. For the year, the divestiture of Park Air Norway and the County of San Diego IT outsourcing contract reduced sales by $100 million, and the JTRS termination accounted for about another $80 million of the variance. After these items, IS sales decline was about 5% and reflects force reductions in overseas contingency operations and a wind down in completion of a variety of programs. IS operating income reflects lower volume and improved performance. Fourth quarter margin rates do reflect the impact of some costs related to affordability initiatives. But for the year, margin rate expanded 60 basis points to 10.3%, outstanding performance, particularly in light of the lower volume in a challenging market environment. For 2013, we expect IS sales of approximately $6.7 billion. I want to point out that about $125 million of that variance to 2012 sales reflects some portfolio shaping activities, as well as the transfer of intercompany efforts to our corporate shared services organization. That transfer, which is about $100 million of the $125 million, does not impact overall company P&L -- as you know, intercompany sales are eliminated -- but will impact the year-over-year comparison for IS. Excluding these items, we expect a decline of about 8 -- 7% due to lower volume for in-theater programs like BACN, Command Post Platform and C-RAM, to name a few, the wind down or completion on a variety of other programs and the expected impacts of the current CR. Moving to Technical Services. Fourth quarter and 2000 sales -- 2012 sales declined 7% and 5%, respectively. Trends in both periods reflect our portfolio shaping actions to reduce base and range operations volume, to lower KC-10 volume and the ICBM program restructuring. Operating income for the fourth quarter is consistent with the change in volume. And for the year, the higher income and margin rate are due to improved performance on the KC-10 program. For 2013, we expect TS sales of approximately $2.7 billion, which contemplates the impact of the current continuing resolution, some force reductions in the ICBM program restructuring and then a little bit of portfolio shaping as well. We expect a mid to high-8% range in margin rate for TS in 2013. And I know many of you know this, but I would point out that our IS and TS businesses are our shortest-cycle businesses and most vulnerable to the uncertainty of the current budget environment. As I said, our segment operating margin rate for 2012 was 12.6%. You will see when we file our 10-K that we had net favorable performance adjustments of $985 million for this year. That includes an increase of about $150 million in favorable adjustments and about $100 million decrease in unfavorable adjustments. Much of the increase in the net favorable adjustments occurred at ES, and I don't expect that to reoccur this year. So on a consolidated basis, we expect segment margin rate in the low to 11% (sic) [low to mid-11%] range. Turning to pension costs for 2013, the assumptions that underlie our 2013 net FAS/CAS pension adjustment of $120 million include a discount rate of 4.12% versus last year's 5.03%. A long term expected rate of return of 8% versus 8.25% last year and reflect 2012 investment returns of slightly more than 12%. We expect 2013 FAS of approximately $380 million, which is about equal to the 2012 amounts, and we expect our CAS cost of approximately $500 million. That CAS amount could move up or down by about $30 million depending upon the outcome of our annual demographic study which we expect to complete in the third quarter of 2013. So after pension cost and corporate unallocated expenses, we would expect our total operating margin rate will range between high-10s and low-11% for 2013. We also expect a tax rate of about 33%. That includes the positive impact of the extension of the 2012 and 2013 R&D credit, which we estimate at about $27 million or about $0.10 or $0.11 for 2013. The 2012 credit, about $15 million, will be recorded in the first quarter of this year. Earnings from continuing operations are expected to range from $6.85 to $7.15 per share, which assumes a weighted average share count reduction of approximately 7%, reflecting continued share repurchases in 2013. Cash from operations of $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion and free cash flow of $1.7 billion to $2.0 billion before the after-tax impact of discretionary pension contributions. We did make progress in 2013 in reducing the seasonality of our cash flow. But I still expect cash flow to be weighted towards the second half of the year. We do plan, at this point, a $500 million discretionary contribution in 2013 over and above our required contributions which are less than $100 million for this year. Beyond 2013, we would expect CAS harmonization will begin to increase CAS pension recoveries in 2014 and '15. And over that same period, our annual pension contributions -- required pension contributions, should be about a little bit less than $100 million, which is principally for our nonqualified plans and some of our foreign plans. In summary, continued strong operating performance, strong cash flows for our businesses in 2013. So Steve, I think with that, we're ready for some Q&A.
Stephen C. Movius: Thanks, Jim. [Operator Instructions] Frances, we are ready to begin the Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Jason Gursky.
Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I wonder if you might just give us a bit of an update on the long term margin targets and whether you've seen any change here as we move into the new year.
James F. Palmer: Yes, we set those targets a number of years ago by looking at the performance of our peers over a long period of time, and we used them to incentivize our organization to improve and drive performance. It's worked really well. I tend to think of those not necessarily as targets, if you will, but more of a benchmark on what our businesses ought to generate over a long period of time. We continue to strive to do better than those "targets" or benchmarks. We have done better than that. We've been very successful in using them as a motivation for our team to do better, and I continue to believe that they are applicable, as I said, over a long period of time looking at the performance that we and our peers have generated during that period of time. I find that they tend to be supported by many of our major peers as well. So all in all, I think they have served us well. They continue to be that benchmark that we refer to and using to strive to do much better. As I said, we continue to incent our team to drive performance, and it really has been beneficial in doing that. So I'm comfortable with them as they are.
Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay, that's great. And then the follow-up question is just a book-to-bill outlook as we move into 2013 and how that kind of translates into revenue streams as we move out.
Wesley G. Bush: Jason, this is Wes. I think we all recognize that this year, with the continuing resolution that we have in place, much less some of the uncertainties that we see as potentials on the horizon, that book-to-bill is going to be under pressure and getting to a 1.0 book-to-bill would be a tremendous outcome. We don't guide on book-to-bill or awards each year, but I would say anything close to 1 for 2013 would be a great outcome.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Doug Harned from Sanford Bernstein.
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: I'm interested, Wes, you've talked about some of the success you've had in cost reductions, square footage, headcount over the past couple of years. And when you sit today and look at the opportunity going forward for the next year and say the following year, does it look as like the opportunities are as large today as you saw in the past?
Wesley G. Bush: Doug, it really depends on the business space that we see on the horizon, and all of that sort of depends on some of these budgetary decisions that get made. To the extent that the there are more severe budgetary outcomes than the Presidents FY '13 budget would suggest, then yes, there's a -- it will go with that. We will need to scale -- continue to scale the operations and continue to address whatever comes our way. I think we've shown we know how to do that. It's not something we'd rather do in terms of dealing with a more severely depressed budget than the Pentagon is already trying to manage its way through, but we do certainly have the capacity and know how to get that done. If things were pretty much on track for the budget, just from my perspective, there's always room for more, and we're going to continue to push and drive efficiency in our corporation. I'm not going to set any public targets on how much more we can get there, but I think I would just say that the market should be informed by the work that we've been doing, that we are determined at ensuring that we can be very, very competitive from a cost structure perspective, and that goes to every aspect of cost. And that we can be putting forward the most affordable concepts and approaches for our customers who are dealing in a much more tightly constrained environment. So it really is a responsibility that we see to support our customers to be most cost efficient as possible.
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: And then on the continuing resolution, certainly with the CR in place, that limits the availability of funds for new starts, for transitions from development into production often. When you look across your portfolio, where are the areas or the major programs that you're most concerned about in terms of being able to ramp up or make the transitions?
Wesley G. Bush: Doug, it touches every one of our sectors in some way. In the large sort of hardware-oriented parts of our business, we have a whole variety of programs that are undergoing that transition. Whether it's unmanned systems like BAMS, even things that are at the very early stages of development, where you want to go out and do long lead that are associated with production. Those -- it would be too long a list to go through. I mean, they're all touched in some way. And then clearly, the shorter-cycle businesses, both Information Systems and Technical Services, deal with this at a much higher rate because the nature of a short-cycle business is you've got to start the new programs more frequently. And when you're constrained in your ability to do that, it really hamstrings the customer community and us from doing that in the most efficient way. Ultimately, what you end up seeing happen in those types of business, our current programs, our services approach get strung out. And while that can be good in some respects, ultimately that's usually not the best answer for the customer either. So I hate to give you too general of an answer to that question, but the detailed answer would be incredibly detailed, and that we see this environment with those types of very tight restrictions really touching all the components of the business. And I think that's why you're hearing -- well, it's one of many reasons why you're hearing the department be so vocal about the CR approach and how constraining it is, and they're attempting to be very clear with the Hill that resolving these restrictions as we come to the end of March and the current CR expires is a necessity for them to be able to really operate the department in a more efficient manner. If we're talking about saving money for the government, efficiency matters, and so that's a critical message.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Carter Copeland from Barclays.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Just, Wes, I know this is a hard topic to address and in terms of contingency planning if we actually do trigger the sequester. I mean, obviously, you have a set of contingency plans that you'll work off of. I wondered if you might kind of take us through what's the sequence of internal events if something like that is triggered. What's the sort of play-by-play of the implementation of one of those plans?
Wesley G. Bush: The work that we've been doing to get ready for the variety of scenarios is both broad and deep. And I guess I should start just by saying that I'm clear about this, I'm not going to speculate on what scenario might lie in front of us, whether it's sequestration or problems associated with the CR that I was referencing in relation to Doug's question. There's clearly a lot of uncertainty on how this whole situation's going to get addressed and the fact that we're seeing now... [Audio Gap] scenarios you think will come into play. But the other think that I think is really important to point out here and sometimes gets lost a little bit in some of this dialogue is, our primary obligation is to successfully execute on the portfolio of contracts that we've taken on. And so the planning work that we're doing is trying to be mindful of what might happen, but also have its primary objective, do no harm. To make sure that we really can and do continue to execute really, really well. When we think about all of these different scenarios, I think to the question you're asking, we have to think about it in terms of contractual, potential contractual actions that our customers would take and traditionally that's what would trigger any particular sequence of events on our side, whether it's delay in terms of slowing a contract down or in a more ugly situation, termination for convenience on the part of the customer. Naturally, as a part of our process, we have gone through our full set of contracts, and we understand what the issues and approaches would be associated with those variety of potential customer actions, and they all vary by scenario, and we're certainly prepared to address those if we have to. In general, as I was remarking earlier to Doug's comment, it adds cost. It adds cost to the department to have to go through and do those things in a period of time when the nation's trying to minimize outlays, the idea of adding cost is not a really good idea. And what's interesting to me is, I don't see folks on the Hill adding up the numbers that go with all of those additional costs that will get created by that massive inefficiency that would result. The other part of the planning process that's also very important is the people part of this. And this isn't just about contracts, contracts turn into work that real people perform, and these are individuals whose skills are precious resources in our country. These are the skills that enable the companies and the Defense Industrial Base to provide the technological superiority upon which our nation's strategy, our national security strategy relies. And so part of our challenge, as we think our way through this, is being ready to address how we most diligently and carefully manage that precious resource of capability that we're going to need to make sure that we preserve our ability to continue to support the nation as we go through this challenge. And I would say that, in my mind, is the most challenging part of this. We're talking about extraordinarily good people who have lots of opportunities and making sure that they see our industry as a great place to continue their careers despite these budgetary pressures. That's something we're all working hard on because we know that ultimately that determines the success of our ability to support the mission that we're here to serve.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Cai Von Rumohr from Cowen and Company.
Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: So F-35, I think on the Q3 call you mentioned... [Technical Difficulty]
Operator: And that question is from Cai Von Rumohr from Cowen and Company.
Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: So I think on the third quarter call you mentioned the F-35 was going to be, I think, higher volume in the second half. Could you give us some sense in terms of where was the F-35 volume last year? Where should it be in 2013? How is your performance and kind of what's the opportunity for improved profitability at some point?
James F. Palmer: Cai, from memory, the F-35 this year was around $1 billion in terms of revenue and about $1 billion would be the expectation for next year as well. You know we don't comment on profitability by individual programs, so I'm really not going to go there. We are working hard to be a teammate with our friends at Lockheed and support the program. We're doing well in our pieces of the work, and I would characterize our margins at this point as basically as I would expect given the stage of the program.
Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: So the follow-up would be if we look at aerospace, you kind of have lower margins projected and some mature stuff coming off. When do we have some of these newer programs like the F-35 reach the point where they should start maturing so that those margins in aerospace could start to improve?
James F. Palmer: On the F-35, I don't really see a step-up in terms of volume until about 2016 given that the current plan for quantities.
Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Okay. But I mean, the question was volume. As you mature the program, and you made the point about where you are in the stage of the program, usually the margins get a bit better. So when do we reach the point when more of that volume starts to become mature?
James F. Palmer: If we want to talk about aerospace in total, we still have a very good strong mix of new development-type programs. And I don't think that changes much over that couple of year period of time going forward. So the good news is, continued growth on new opportunities will be important as that portfolio transitions over time.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: I wanted to talk a little bit about ES. Jim, you had mentioned about the net favorable adjustments this year and that they were the majority of the total. If I back those out, and I don't know exactly what the total favorable adjustments are, but it would still seem to imply a margin well into the high-14s on the baseline, and your guidance seems to imply kind of 50 basis points below that. So I'm wondering why is it declining kind of even x the adjustments in 2013 versus 2012?
James F. Palmer: I thought you were going to ask me why they were above our long term rate of return or something.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: No, the basis points are, that's not a new question.
James F. Palmer: Oh, okay. I think that the guys, the team at ES is just doing a fabulous job over the last few years. They really have driven up the margins. We've worked really hard to reduce the negative adjustments that part of that business has been plagued by over looking back 3 or 4 years or so. And at low to mid-14s, I think they're going to just have a great year.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: So there's not really a change in the mix or development to production or anything else that's going to drive it?
James F. Palmer: I don't think so. We do have -- did have in 2012 a number of programs or contracts reached the end of their production or life. And as well, did get a benefit from the cost-reduction activities that we undertook at ES and at the company in '11 and in '12 had a big impact or favorable impact on their contracts. And as you know, you give those up as you go forward with new contracts. All of that are factors into that overall margin rate expectation for ES for 2013. Having said that, you bet we're going to push to get us the very best performance that we can out of that part of the business and every other part of the business.
Wesley G. Bush: Jim, I would just add that similar to your earlier remarks around aerospace, ES has been very successful these last couple of years in capturing some new development work as well. And as you all know that the margin rates during the development cycle are generally less, and I think we'll see some of that too.
James F. Palmer: And we have some new development activities, possibilities.
Wesley G. Bush: Exactly, on the horizon here.
Operator: And your next question will come from the line of Rob Stallard from Royal Bank of Canada.
Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Just a quick one, Jim, actually. I was looking at goodwill on the balance sheet. You've got $2.4 billion. I was wondering if you did your annual impairment review, what the results of that where, how much cushion you might have from the latest reassessment of that goodwill?
James F. Palmer: You bet, we did our annual impairment test. And just like last year, the most sensitive piece of our businesses is IS, and we do have a cushion. It's not real large, if you want to call it that or look at it from that perspective, but we're comfortable with where we are at the end of the year and as we go forward, we'll do the test again based on new information when we have it.
Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: I mean, I'm sure you wouldn't be able to get into specific details, but can you give us an idea of maybe how much that cushion might have reduced versus last year?
James F. Palmer: It's down a little bit from last year, and frankly, the cushion is a combination of a whole bunch of different factors. Obviously, interest rates play into the discount rate on the use of discount cash flows that has an impact on terminal value, has an impact on pension liability. All those are factors in the overall calculation, but it does start with the expected cash flows from the business. And our guys at IS, although revenues were down, we still expect that they'll have reasonably healthy margins given our guidance for 2013, and again, comfortable with where we are.
Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: And just a quick one for you, Wes. I was wondering if you can maybe comment on the competitive environment that you are seeing in services and your ability to preserve margins going forward.
Wesley G. Bush: I think a lot of that goes back to the point I was making earlier around affordability. Clearly, as the department's budgets are under increasing pressure, our customer community needs our industrial base to drive additional efficiencies into the way that we do business, which we've been busily doing now for several years, and they need good ideas. They need the innovation that can come out of our industry to suggest alternative approaches to getting things done. So I think, just thinking about it very broadly, the competitive environment is going to be very healthy. I think everyone's working on cost and everyone's working on innovation. And hopefully, we're all going to be able to not only be competitive with each other, but be supportive of our customers in this more difficult period of time. It is going to be a challenging competitive environment. I don't want to sound dismissive of that at all. Those of us who had been through defense downturns in the past have that experience under our belt and understand very clearly what that means. But that's part of the reason we've been doing the work we've been doing to get ready for this.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: The first question is more of a clarification, Jim, I think in the slides it implies what the share -- diluted share count benefit is to EPS with 6% drawdown. I don't have the period end share count, so I don't know exactly, but is the share repurchase number on a dollar basis about...
James F. Palmer: It's 7% on a weighted average shares this year to next year.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Yes, is the dollar repurchase assumed to be about the same?
James F. Palmer: Yes, roughly the same. Obviously, for planning purposes, we've assumed that it's generally proportionate throughout the year, which equates to about a little bit more actually. It's price dependent, obviously.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Yes. That kind of brings me to the question, so -- to your earlier comments on your pension plan, you're in a much better funding position than probably anyone else or definitely better than anyone else out there and probably 85% or so funded.
James F. Palmer: Actually, 83%. You'll see in the K.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: 83%, all right. So if I look at your cash balance, that continues to grow. You're returning over 80% or 80% of the free cash flow generated in 2012. But again, the cash balance continues to grow. You're in a net cash or close to net cash or 0 net debt position. At what point do you actually take some of the cash balances and return those or at least increase more than 100% free cash flow return to shareholders? Or is there M&A out there on the horizon that you'd like to retain it for?
James F. Palmer: Well, actually, if you think about the comments that we just went through pro rata a little bit more than last year, dividends and our free cash flow guidance for 2013, you're at 100% if not maybe more than 100% just with that.
Wesley G. Bush: Yes, Myles, I'll just add. We continue to see share repurchase as a very important part of our overall balanced cash deployment strategy. We think that has been serving our shareholders well, and it has been a good use of our cash. We do think about our business over the longer cycle and that's the perspective that we have in mind when we're thinking about our approach in share repurchase in particular. So it continues to be a very attractive mechanism for cash deployment for us.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. So the cash balance though question, you would still expect it to be not coming down anytime soon in terms of this being the level that you'd be comfortable maintaining on the balance sheet?
James F. Palmer: I'm sorry?
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: It seems like...
James F. Palmer: If I have, let me try to answer. $1.7 billion to $2 billion on free cash flow, and let's call that midpoint of $1.8 billion or something like that. $500 million for dividends, round numbers. If I have a similar amount of share repurchases to last year's, that's $1.8 billion, midpoint of that free cash flow. Got CapEx. That free cash flow is out of that. But then if I spend any money at all on things like funding the pension plan or other opportunities, and clearly, as we tried to outline, we're in an uncertain environment, so we do want some financial flexibility to be able to deal with that. I think I'm, on one hand, I'm continuing to do what we've set out to do and have done over the last few years with deploying cash to invest in the business, to manage our pension plans and return excess cash to shareholders and provide us with financial flexibility to deal with this uncertain fiscal environment that we're in at this point in time.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of David Strauss from UBS.
David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Your level of EACs that you've assumed in your 2013 guidance is what?
James F. Palmer: Less than last year.
David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. Any -- obviously, last year was close to $1 billion was pretty high. Any sort of range?
James F. Palmer: No. I really think about it as those overall margin rate as opposed to what kind of level of adjustments do I need to have to get there.
David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. Jim, on the cash flow from ops walk, can you give us some help on working capital, cash taxes, what's baked into that number relative to 2012?
James F. Palmer: Yes. As you all know, the hardest bit in this business on cash flow projection is working capital. So right now, the guidance anticipates a use of working capital anywhere from, let's call it, $50 million to $250 million for the year. Cash taxes and tax expense roughly about the same, maybe $50 million greater on cash taxes. And then the other variable in that whole range of EBITDA to free cash flow is, first of all, stock compensation, about $100 million and then CapEx of around $400 million for the year.
David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Great. And then last one, if I'm looking at it correctly, you still have a decent chunk of what would be considered relatively high cost debt outstanding given today's rate environment. What's the plan, if anything, to address that? I know other companies have gone after that pretty aggressively.
James F. Palmer: We tendered for all of that or much of that in 2010. We actually tendered for $1.9 billion at the time and were able to pry out about $800 million. We continue to look at it, continue to look at who holds it and the likelihood that they might be receptive to tenders. And at this point, we haven't been able to convince ourselves that something like that makes sense given who the holders are of that -- largely of that high-coupon debt.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research.
George Shapiro: I wanted to ask, you were surprising to me in the sense that you had substantially up margins where a couple of your major competitors had down margins in the quarter. But yet, you're still guiding to significantly lower margin in '13 and even though you've always been conservative in the past, I'm just wondering, is it all just EACs reflecting in '13 or the core programs are that much tougher? Can you just go through that a little bit more?
James F. Palmer: Well, I would say that we have an increasingly tougher environment. At the same time, we're working very hard to make sure that on all the new contracts we get reasonable terms and conditions, that our cost estimates fairly reflect what we think our cost are to do the work. As I did mention earlier, we have taken -- we tried to get out ahead of what we saw as a decline starting in 2011. We did take a number of actions to reduce, as Wes said, our footprint and our headcount. We did get a benefit in 2012 on our backlog for those activities. And our backlog normally runs about 1.5 years. If you get all the benefit on 1.5 years, you get a year's worth in '12, you don't have a whole lot left, do you? So it's a combination of just what we see in the marketplace in terms of the environment and the actions we've taken that have resulted in favorable performance adjustments. As I said, we have also worked very hard to reduce the quantity and the quantum of any of our problem programs and been, I think, pretty successful with that. So it's really just that look at the entire portfolio of programs and where we stand that lead to our judgment around those margin rates for 2013, which I think are really strong operating performance, particularly in light of our benchmarks for the types of businesses we're in, which, as I said, largely are confirmed by many of our peers, both in their guidance for this year, as well as their performance. So all in all, I think we're doing a pretty good job.
George Shapiro: You definitely are. And just a follow-up for either you or Wes. So Wes, you clearly have done a great job in taking out cost before ahead of revenues. Can you continue to do that if sequestration goes into place, which is going to be somewhat more abrupt? I mean, how do you actually plan to be able to do that or continue that?
Wesley G. Bush: George, I've remarked on this just a little bit earlier that in the event of sequestration or other budgetary actions, our first challenge is going to be addressing whatever contractual changes come along. But ultimately, we have to scale cost structure with that, and that's what our planning has been focused on, to enable us to do that in a smart way so that we're not doing something that undermines our ability to perform for the long term. But we worked our way through those scenarios and are certainly ready to take on the variety of scenarios. Ultimately though, in any of those outcomes, first and foremost, we're going to have to deal with the contractual matters.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Yair Reiner from Oppenheimer.
Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: A question about free cash flows after discretionary pension. They've been fairly volatile here over the last couple of years. $1.9 billion a couple of years ago and now just $2.3 billion in 2012, and I guess the guidance for 2013 implies somewhere between $1.2 billion and $1.5 billion. Now I understand that a lot of these discretionary pension payments are going to come back to you later on, but can you just help us understand what we should think about as a long term sustainable free cash flow after pension?
James F. Palmer: I've said a number of times publicly that I think even in this environment, that we're going to have relatively strong free cash flows as we look forward. I really don't see -- we've had strong cash flows. I continue to expect that we will have those relatively strong cash flows, free cash flows on a go-forward basis. I don't know what else to tell you there.
Wesley G. Bush: And we look at the voluntary pension amounts sort of on a year-by-year basis depending on what's going on in the marketplace and the economic benefit that we see by making those contributions. So that is something that we do look at and make decisions based on the environment. And a look to the longer term as well.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Joe Nadol from JPMorgan.
Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Your backlog went up, both funded and overall, this past year and you have revenue guidance that's down without sequestration, and I was wondering if you could comment on whether that's just a profile of the backlog, the tail got bigger or if there's something else in your planning? And also, you had a good quarter from a sales standpoint, I might add, the best one you've had in a while.
James F. Palmer: Joe, backlog is a function of obviously contracts and the genuine performance of contracts. A contributor to our backlog this year is the NATO AGS contract. It extends over 5 years or so. So when you get a contract like that, it adds to your overall backlog numbers as well as the period of performance that goes with that. So that's principally the factor that you're seeing that's contributing to growth in backlog dollars, and you perform those contracts, as I said, over about a 5-year period of time.
Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: So it's just AGS?
James F. Palmer: NATO AGS.
Wesley G. Bush: And Joe, in my earlier commentary, I sort of went through the components of the -- of about roughly $1 billion differential in sales. So I don't know if you caught that commentary, but it might be helpful in addressing your question as well.
Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And the next one, the second one is just we're all focused right here on the sequestration and the CR and everything. Wes, when you look out a little further or not even that much further. You have this Jammer, this Next Gen Jammer competition. Could you comment on that and your teaming arrangement there with Exelis and what led you down that path? And then really, any other competitive situations that you see over the next year to 2 for the company that you consider important?
Wesley G. Bush: There's a whole variety of activities that we're pursuing, and I like your perspective on it, that we all do need to keep looking down the road because the nation's going to continue to need a Defense Industrial Base, and we're going to continue to need that technological superiority that the industrial base provides. Next Generation Jammer is an exciting opportunity. We've been working on that now for some time. Our teaming with Exelis was driven by a view of how do we bring the very best offering to our customer. And we saw in the team at Exelis some great capability that when combined with ours, we believe is a compelling offer. So that relationship is going well, and I'm looking forward to continuing it. There are whole series of opportunities of that nature and some even larger scale as we look on the horizon. Clearly, both the Air Force and the Navy, and I would add to that, the intelligence community really need to position their capabilities to align with the nation's evolving national security strategy. This pivot to Asia-Pacific has brought implications on the types of capabilities that are going to be needed, that range from aircraft, unmanned and manned. They range to sensor systems, the C4ISR domain. And also, cyber continues to be just a heck of a challenge for our country, and we think it's going to continue to be a challenge. So across that array of sort of broad mission areas, there are whole array of specific programmatic targets, both '13 and '14, that we are investing in and continuing to push hard on. One point I would make in response to your question, that even while we're seeing a perhaps tougher environment around the top lines, we're committed to continuing to invest for the future here. We think that -- we feel very strongly that it's going to be imperative that the Defense Industrial Base continue to bring innovation to the nation's capabilities and investing now is going to be important for our ability to serve for the long term.
Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Wes, are you seeing the procurement groups at your classified customers having the same sort of freezing up, same sort of issues that the broader customer set is going through right now? Or have there been more provisions for -- to enable them to operate more smoothly through this whole situation?
Wesley G. Bush: Joe, there's only so much I can say about that, but I will say that they too are subject to the legislation around the CR and potentially, if we were to get to the sequester, those issues as well. So they're having to address that in a very prudent manner and address it from a planning perspective as well. So these budgetary effects sometimes just get a stamp on it associated with the Department of Defense, but they hit everybody. And I think it's important to understand that from a broad policymaking perspective, that this really does span across government, all the functions of government.
Operator: And the last question will come from the line of Howard Rubel from Jefferies.
Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Kind of 2 parts. Wes, the interesting thing about all that's gone on is the authorization bill protected Global Hawk in a big way and actually underscored how important it was. Can you address sort of some of the other positives that came out of that and how do you sort of square that walk with what Congress' will there with, in fact, this meat-axe approach to solving a problem that doesn't?
Wesley G. Bush: Yes, it's hard to square that, Howard, I appreciate your question. It's clear to us that when Congress, and then particularly those in Congress who are charged with addressing specific matters associated with the functioning of our government, when they're given the latitude to dig in and really address a particular issue, they're able to do that strategically, and they're able to make great decisions. When there is this broad umbrella approach to trying to deal with the bigger challenges without dealing with the strategy, you get to these other approaches that really don't make sense from a strategic perspective. On Block 30, I would just say that we continue to be pleased with the performance in-theater of those systems. They're in very high demand by the combatant commanders, and we were just delighted to see the Authorization Act support the continuation of Block 30. We continue to work with the Air Force to provide more affordable approaches to sustaining that program because we think that will be something that's going to be important to the country's ability to conduct its surveillance mission for a long time. So I would just say, it's sort of a contrast between the processes, when the Congressional processes that have been developed over many years to work on and deal with the authorization and appropriations for specific components of government are allowed to do their jobs, I think we get to very good rational outcomes. When there's this broad across-the-board meat-axe approach, we get to really bad outcomes.
Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: And then just last, just a follow-up. I mean, the numbers would say, you don't have very many red programs or anything close to them, but I'm sure there's always you're not happy with. How would you evaluate maybe the bottom 10% of your performers at the moment? What are you trying to do to change that?
Wesley G. Bush: Yes, we've been doing a lot of work on that over the past few years. Jim alluded earlier to the fact that it wasn't that long ago, 4 or so years ago that we had a serious list of red programs that we kept talking to you all about, it seemed like every quarter. So the focus on performance in our company is not just about margin rates. It goes to performance for our customers as well. It starts with quality. It starts with the quality of our processes and the quality of how we approach getting the work done, and I'm not just talking about quality coming out the end of the production line. It's the quality of engineering, it's the qualitative of contracting, it's all of those aspects. So we're not perfect. I wouldn't want anybody to hear that we think we are somehow reaching a point of perfection in any way. We have still a lot of work to do as any honest organization would tell you. But we have substantially reduced the number of programs in our portfolio that are demonstrating those performance variations, in part because I think we've made good progress on our risk management methodologies. And for those programs that are in sort of the bottom 10%, I would characterize them as those where the risk that we've identified and been working to manage still find a way to manifest in some way, but we're able to get on it more quickly and more aggressively, and we've become a lot better about utilizing the resources of the entire corporation to go after them when those problems pop up. So still work to do, still, I think, to some extent inevitable in the technologically complex environment in which we operate, but a lot better place than we were a few years ago.
Stephen C. Movius: This concludes the Q&A session. I would like to turn it over to Jim for a couple of brief comments on some information that's always of interest to you all, and then turn it over the Wes for final comments.
James F. Palmer: I'm kind of disappointed. I didn't get my normal FAS/CAS pension question. Let me try to answer what I would have anticipated to be your questions. So we talked about our FAS and CAS guidance for 2013, and if I look forward to, let's say 2015, 2 years out, I would expect based on no change in our assumptions that our FAS cost would decline about $130 million and that CAS cost would increase about $300 million or the net FAS/CAS change being about $430 million. 2014 is probably halfway in between the 2013 numbers and the 2014 numbers. Spent some time this morning talking about the current environment, the possibility that we're faced with at least an uncertain defense budget and likely a declining defense budget. So clearly, in that environment, the emphasis on affordability is so important. So growth in CAS cost isn't necessarily good as it does add to the affordability challenge that we all face in light of that environment. So we are working really hard to reduce both FAS and our CAS cost. And if we find ourselves in a rising interest rate environment, as you know from our past conversations, that rising interest rate has a near-term impact on our FAS cost, and we would look at that today at being every 25 basis points is in a range of $85 million to $90 million. However, because of MAP-21, a rising interest rate environment over the near-term likely doesn't have nearly the impact on FAS as it does on CAS and on funding. So ultimately, besides rising interest rates over a long term, the important levers for reducing or controlling your FAS cost or CAS cost rather, CAS cost as well as funding are first of all, investment performance. Our 10-year compound annual rate of return is just under 10%. And then you have to manage the provisions of your plans. We have capped entrants to the pension plan back in 2008, as I recall. So any new employees do not have the same pension benefits as the past. And then last year, we announced another change for our pension plans that essentially capped growth in compensation cost, all of which are aimed at reducing that CAS cost on a go-forward basis. So we've been working really hard. I know you all are interested in those trends around FAS and CAS, so I wanted to give you that flavor as you work your models, but this is going to be an important item as we go forward. So Wes, with that I think we're ready to close.
Wesley G. Bush: Thanks, Jim and Steve. Let me just wrap up with a couple of thank yous. First, thank you to our employees for their incredible focus on performance and serving our customers. Our 2012 outcomes are due to the hard work of our team, and we all sincerely appreciate that. And secondly, thanks to all of you for your continuing interest in our company. We appreciate you being with us on the call today. Thanks, everyone.

Stephen C. Movius: Thanks, Frances, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's Third Quarter 2012 Conference Call. We provided supplemental information in the form of a PowerPoint presentation that you can access at www.northropgrumman.com. Before we start, please understand that matters discussed on today's call constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to safe harbor provisions of federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which are detailed in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risk factors may cause actual company results to differ materially. On the call today are our Chairman, CEO and President, Wes Bush; and our CFO, Jim Palmer. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Wes.
Wesley G. Bush: All right, thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us on our third quarter conference call. We're very pleased with this quarter's results and the performance of our businesses year-to-date. We continue to drive program performance, aggressively pursue high-quality new business with innovative, affordable solutions, reduce our cost structure and align our portfolio with our customer spending priorities in a dynamic environment. Our intense focus on these actions, combined with effective cash deployment, continues to create value for our shareholders, customers and our employees. These are not new initiatives for us. These are the ongoing efforts and actions that have generated substantial performance improvement over the last few years and that will be increasingly important in today's challenging environment. Third quarter EPS are comparable to last year despite continued top-line pressure. On a pension-adjusted basis, our third quarter earnings per share increased 6%. We achieved this improvement through a combination of operational performance and share repurchases. All 4 of our businesses performed well in the quarter. Our businesses continue to generate strong operating income, margin rates and cash flow. Year-to-date, we've captured more than $20 billion in new business awards for a book-to-bill ratio of more than 100%. And cash generation has also been strong, even after our $300 million discretionary pension contribution, free cash flow totaled $748 million in the third quarter. And year-to-date, we've generated free cash flow of $1.4 billion or nearly 100% of net income. Our robust margin rates and cash conversion demonstrate the quality of our operational performance for the quarter and year-to-date. We're very proud of our employees' outstanding efforts in generating these results. Our strong cash generation continues to support share repurchases. During the quarter we repurchased about 4.4 million shares of our stock for $290 million. And year-to-date, we've repurchased 13.6 million shares for approximately $850 million. In the first 9 months of the year, share repurchases and dividends have totaled more than $1.2 billion or nearly 90% of free cash flow. We continually assess our share repurchase program to ensure that it's creating long-term shareholder value. As you know, ours is a long cycle business, and we take that perspective when considering the value of our enterprise. We consider our long-term value relative to the market's current valuation of our cash flows and earnings. Based on where we are in the cycle, and the prices at which we are purchasing shares, we believe that share repurchases continue to contribute to long-term value creation. The board recently increased our remaining share repurchase authorization to $2 billion, which provides flexibility in a dynamic environment. Turning to guidance, based on the strength of year-to-date results, we expect to end the year with sales of approximately $25 billion. And we now expect 2012 earnings per share of $7.35 to $7.40. On a pension-adjusted basis, this represents EPS growth of approximately 8% over last year. We're also increasing our guidance for cash from operations and free cash flow. Before discretionary pension contributions, we now expect operations to generate $2.5 billion to $2.8 billion, with free cash flow of $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion. Looking ahead to next year, there is substantial uncertainty regarding federal budgets, including whether sequestration will occur, and if so, how it would be implemented. We believe that sequestration would not apply to obligated program funds that are currently in our funded backlog, but there's little doubt that the long-term impact of sequestration would be highly detrimental to national security and our industrial base. The short-term impacts, should sequestration take effect in January, are more difficult to assess given the lack of specific implementation detail. As a result, we're preparing for a wide range of budget outcomes. But under any scenario, we expect that as currently provided for under the Budget Control Act, sequestration would result in lower revenues, profits and cash flows for our company and our industry over the long-term. Now in addition to sequestration and the potential impacts of the other fiscal cliff issues, we're now working under a 6-month continuing resolution. This CR is more challenging than in previous years in that there appear to be virtually no exceptions for new program starts, which includes new tasks on IDIQs and increases in production quantities. There's also limited ability to effectively shift programming -- shift funding between programs as has been done in the past to mitigate execution issues. There's no certainty when we'll have a formal 2013 budget, and it is possible that the CR would need to be extended, which would be an additional source of uncertainty for us and our customer community. So as we think about next year, our outlook is clouded by these challenges. How all these issues are resolved will determine the degree to which our top line is impacted. However, under any reasonable scenario, we would expect lower 2013 sales as a result of the CR restriction on new starts, along with the other constraints our customers are facing. We will be providing our detailed 2013 guidance when we announce our fourth quarter and year-end earnings. In closing, it was a very good quarter, and we expect a strong finish to the year. Obviously, looking ahead to 2013, there is a high degree of uncertainty, as I said. But we believe we are taking the right steps in the current environment by bringing innovative, affordable solutions to support our customers' needs. And we believe we can continue to create value by remaining focused on our key priorities; performance, cash deployment and portfolio. So now, I'll turn the call over to Jim for a more detailed discussion of results and guidance. Jim?
James F. Palmer: Thanks, Wes. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Highlights for the quarter were outstanding cash generation and strong, consistent segment operating margin rates. This performance, combined with share repurchases, generated this quarter's 6% increase in quarterly pension-adjusted earnings per share. Now, let's spend a few minutes looking at some of the details behind the results. Those results reflect our continued focus on program execution and aggressive cost management and reduction activities. Although operating income declined by the $66 million change in the net FAS/CAS pension adjustment, on a pension-adjusted basis, our operating margin rate expanded 20 basis points to 11.2%. In addition to the pension impacts, operating income also reflects lower volume, which was partially offset by an improvement in corporate and allocated expenses. EAC adjustments for the quarter were a net positive $214 million versus $196 million in the prior year third quarter. The primary driver of the change was a $38 million reduction in unfavorable performance adjustments compared to last year's third quarter. Based on our year-to-date performance, we now expect a 2012 segment operating margin rate of approximately 12%, with a total operating margin rate in the high 11% range. As I mentioned, cash results for the quarter were simply outstanding. During the quarter, we did make a $300 million discretionary contribution to our pension plans which, after tax considerations, reduced third quarter cash from operations and free cash flow by $221 million. Year-to-date, cash from operations is more than $500 million ahead of last year's pace and free cash flow is nearly $700 million higher. Given that performance, we are raising our guidance for 2000 cash from operations and free cash flow. But in doing so, I should caveat that by noting that our guidance does not contemplate any and unusual year end customer behavior due to pending issues such as the debt ceiling, the fiscal cliff, or potential sequestration. Turning to the sectors, Aerospace third quarter sales increased $131 million, or 5%. We continue to see growth in our Unmanned Systems portfolio, principally due to the ramp-up on programs such as NATO AGS and Fire Scout. Military aircraft sales also increased due to higher F-35 volume, which includes deliveries of the first units under the LRIP 5 program for F-35. You will recall that we adopted the units of delivery revenue recognition for F-35, LRIP 5 and we are now recognizing LRIP 5 revenues with the commencement of the deliveries in this quarter. Higher volume for Unmanned and Military Aircraft was partially offset by lower sales for Space System programs, including some restricted programs and the impact of the DWSS termination in the fourth quarter of last year. Aerospace operating income declined by 2%, resulted in operating margin rate of 11.1% for the quarter, compared to 12% for last year's quarter. The major change in the margin rate is the transition to the lower margin multi- year 3 contract on the F-18. For the year, we expect Aerospace sales of about $9.9 billion with a margin rate in the mid-to-high 11% range. Electronic system sales declined by $198 million or 10% due to lower revenue in postal automation, combat avionics, infrared countermeasures and laser systems. Postal automation includes the de-emphasis of our domestic postal automation business, as well as a softening in the international postal sales in Europe. Combat sales -- Combat Avionics sales declined due to lower unit deliveries for several programs, including the F-22. And Infrared Countermeasures and Laser System programs declined due to force reductions in overseas contingency operations. These declines were partially offset by higher volume for some Space Systems programs. ES operating income declined 5% and operating margin rate increased 90 basis points to 16.3%. You may recall that last year's third quarter included a $25 million provision for the domestic Postal Automation Program, and without that provision, last year's operating margin rate would be comparable to this year. For the year, we expect ES revenues of approximately $7 billion, with a margin rate of low-to-mid 16%, up from our prior guidance of low-to-mid 15%. Information Systems sales declined $179 million or approximately 9% for the quarter. About $100 million of that is due to the wind down or completion of programs, including JTRS AMF and several restricted programs. Another $30 million is associated with in-theater force reductions and finally, the sale of Park Air Norway impacted third quarter sales by $17 million. The balance reflects just general market softening due to the uncertainty of the budget environment and the shorter cycled nature of our IS business. Consistent with third quarter sales trends, IS operating margin declined 9%. Our operating margin rate was unchanged at 9.6%. For the year, we now expect IS sales of approximately $7.3 billion, and we continue to expect a 10% operating margin rate for IS for this year. Turning to Technical Services, third quarter sales fell 6%, largely due to lower volume for the KC-10 program. Our previously announced portfolio of shaping actions in Defense and Government Services also reduced third quarter sales. And on an absolute basis, TS operating income was comparable to the prior year, with operating margin rate expanding 40 basis points to 8.3%, due to improved program performance. For the year, we now expect TS sales of approximately $3 billion, with margin rates in the high 8% range. On a consolidated basis, we're looking for 2012 sales of approximately $25 billion, and we are increasing our segment operating margin guide rate guidance to approximately 12%, with total operating margin rate guidance to the high 11% range. Now, let's spend a few minutes talking about everybody's favorite subject, 2013 pension. I should remind you that there are a number of assumptions that are -- that we determine at the end of the year that will principally affect FAS pension cost in 2013. Two of those key assumptions that are critical are the actual return on investment assets in 2012, and then the discount rate used to discount pension liabilities at the end of the year. Now through September 30, our actual asset return, investment return is approximately 10%, compared to our expected long-term rate of return of 8.25%. And I think you will recall that for every 100 basis points above or below the expected rate of return affects 2013 FAS expense by $40 million. And if we had to set the discount rate at September 30, we would likely be looking at about 100 basis points lower than what we've used to discount liabilities last year. And again, just a reminder that I think you know that we are required to set all of these assumptions at the end of the year. And so with a little over 2 months to go, we may continue to see volatility, particularly in interest rates, due to matters such as the pending fiscal cliff or global economic factors. But again, for modeling purposes, just a reminder, every 25 basis points change in the discount rate impacts 2013 FAS expense by about, anywhere in the $75 million to $80 million range. So at the start of the year, and again a reminder, we had estimated our 2013 net FAS/CAS income to be about $250 million. And obviously, that estimate had assumed no change in the discount rate or asset returns above or below the long-term rate of return assumption of 8.25%. Our estimate for CAS for next year has not changed much but obviously, interest rates and plan asset returns, among other assumptions, will have a significant impact on 2013 FAS expense. Well Stephen, in closing, I would say a very strong operational performance that we've seen for the first 2 quarters, continues into the third quarter. Expect a strong finish to the year. As I said, strong cash flow. So bearing any unusual customer behaviors resulting from the uncertain budget environment, I think we're going to have a strong finish to the year. So with that, I think we're ready for Q&A.
Stephen C. Movius: Thanks, Jim. [Operator Instructions] Frances, we are ready to begin the Q&A process.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Wes, I know you alluded to 2013. You'd have some top-line pressure, regardless of the sequestration situation that evolves. Curious, could you comment on the margin side, Jim or Wes? Regardless of -- or let's assume, no sequestration. What kind, if any, headwind on the margin side we should anticipate? Obviously, you had a strong performance on EACs and the negative EACs continue to come down. Just don't know how much more opportunity there is for the unfavorables to come down. If you can kind of elaborate, maybe just at the high level?
James F. Palmer: Myles, let me give you a range of thoughts here. Clearly, 2012, we've had a benefit from the cost reduction activities we've undertaken over the last year and a half in terms of our existing backlog. Some of that backlog continues to have those benefits on a go-forward basis. Secondly, I would observe that the contracting environment is -- it's a little more difficult that it has to been in the past. It means that we got to be diligent about terms and conditions and contract structure. And most importantly, it means that we have to do what we are charged to do, manage our programs. Thirdly, we do take a look every year at long-term rate of return assumptions for our 4 business areas. I'm very comfortable with where we are, but we'll take another look at that. Based on what we see, as in -- as performance in the industry. And we may revise or we may continue to hold the long-term rate of return assumptions that we have today. But again, I feel very good about where we are in terms of the businesses. Clearly, our job is to do better than those long-term rate of return assumptions and we've been able to do that over the last couple of years, basically through a combination of affordability initiatives and then managing the programs. And then finally, we're not standing still. We continue to take actions to improve affordability within the company, which again, it will give us an advantage on the existing backlog even for new contracts that we negotiate today. So in summary, I would say just outstanding performance from the team for this year, and we feel good about the long-term view of the businesses and what the margin ought to be able to generate. And it's up to us to manage our programs.
Operator: [Audio Gap] the line of Doug Harned from Sanford Bernstein.
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: I'm interested on the -- in thinking about the top-line outlook, because if you look at what you all have done over the last few years in terms of reshaping the portfolio, exiting some businesses, ramping down some things like activities in the postal automation area. And then OCL funding coming down. So you've had some things that have taken the top line down. A few contract inflations [ph] . So are we at a point where you can sort of reset the business? And if we set sequestration aside, are we at a point where, as you look forward, are we looking at something that's stable, declining or even maybe some modest growth out over the next few years?
Wesley G. Bush: Doug, let me frame it this way. If we look at 2013 in particular, clearly sequestration is a big, big variable in all of this so, but to the point of your question, if we set it aside, the other reality that we are dealing with now is this continuing resolution, 6 month CR. And it's a pretty tight CR in terms of the way that it's crafted. It puts an enormous number of constraints on our customer community, with respect to what they can do on new starts or transitions into production, or even under IDIQs. So given that, that appears to be at least a 6-month concern, and that will put negative pressure on the top line, sort of across the board. That's going to be a fact of life that we're dealing with. So ultimately, stability in our top line will go sort of hand-in-hand with greater stability and how the government is appropriating and executing the budgets that are allocated for defense, and the other agencies that we serve. The other factor though that I would say, needs to be considered, even if you set aside sequestration, is just how much money is going to be allocated for defense, ultimately in the budget environment? We all know that there is a substantial deficit situation, and that there are some tough decisions that lie ahead to be made regarding the outcomes for each component of that budget. So it's a little unclear today, from where we are, how to predict, how that will go. But to the point that you made, we feel good about how our portfolio is positioned in that regard. We feel that we've done a good job of getting aligned on priorities. So when those budgets get set, it's our expectation that our portfolio will do well in a relative sense against those priorities. The other longer-term opportunity for the company continues to be on the international side. As you know, our international sales, historically have been largely confined to our Electronics business. And while we've been very pleased with those sales and the team at Electronics has done a great job of making those sales very effective for us, we see additional opportunities emerging, particularly in our Aerospace Systems business, but also in IS and TS as we take a broader look and engage with our DoD customers in terms of their strategy on what they would like to see our partners around the globe, be able to do. We see a growing push to take some of the capabilities that historically we've had some challenges exporting. We see a growing push to make those more available to our partners. So that's not the near-term thing. It takes a while to get those through the policy arena and then actually execute it in terms of specific programmatic decisions. But we also see our portfolio as being well-aligned for some of the important thrusts that we see from an emerging policy perspective and supporting our allies around the globe.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: I'm sorry to kind of try and do 2 parts here, but just Wes, just to continue on the continuing resolution question, isn't the absolute level of the CR higher than what the original request is? And so wouldn't that actually, in some ways, be beneficial? And maybe you can talk about some of the starts that you expected this year that get pushed out.
Wesley G. Bush: Well, it is just very slightly higher in a total magnitude sense, but what ultimately counts is what the constraints are that get implemented program by program. So you have to sort of peel that apart. And I -- we're all glad that the total number for the CR was a good number relative to the President's budget. But when it comes to executing programs, particularly programs that are in any form of transition, if it's a transition from development to production, if it's an IDIQ contract where you're finishing off a task, an order on an IDIQ contract and they want to issue a new task. And, if you're just looking at the broader set of constraints that went with -- and this was a very tightly prescribed CR. More tightly than we have seen in the past. So that, that was really the comment that I had on why that is an issue relative to how the top line will work out. Just about every program in our community has a fair amount of variability around where the funding is coming from, what the line items are. And when you start putting those types of constraints on it, it does have implications on what our customers can do. So that's all of our hope that we move through this CR as expeditiously as we can and get a real piece of legislation that really does the appropriations the way they need to be done so that our customer community can go and execute on their mission. That's our, I would say at a, the top-level, our primary concern. I think it tends to impact our shorter cycle businesses more dramatically, but even some of our more substantial programs that are making that transition from design into production could be impacted by those constraints, depending on the timing of the actual appropriations language and how long we actually live under this CR environment.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I just wanted to ask, when I'm looking at the balance sheet, it looks like you'll end the year close to or in a small net cash position. Rates are particularly low out there right now. I wonder how you just think about the right level of balance sheet utilization. And there's obviously plenty of uncertainty ahead, particularly in the near-term, but you could add a significant amount to the balance sheet and still keep your leverage metrics fairly low? Or perhaps you just want to wait until the sequestration outcome is resolved? But if you could just speak to how you're thinking about that, probably that'd be very helpful.
James F. Palmer: You're correct, Noah, in your observation. We have a very conservative balance sheet at this point in time. We view flexibility as very important. The cash balances provide us that flexibility in this uncertain environment. Having some certainty around future budget outlooks would be really important. We're mindful of where interest rates are. We've watched that very carefully. I don't know that we're going to see a significant change in interest rates in the near-term. I'd like to believe that we are, but I doubt that we are. So I think that the market flexibility will likely remain for a reasonable period of time, that if we wanted to take advantage of that, we would have the opportunity. But in today's environment, having the flexibility that our capital structure reflects today is really important.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Joe Nadol from JPMorgan.
Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I'd like to get back to a strategic question that is not new, but just to get your latest thinking on it for either or both of you. It has to do with share repurchase. You guys are continuing to -- it's your primary use of free cash flow. It's about half of what you're looking for in terms of cash flow before pension contributions this year, is what you're on track to do. And you're indicating that sales are going to face pressure next year. You're indicating that margins are still above their long-term rate. And so, when you evaluate the value in your stock to repurchase it, and I'd just like to maybe get an update on how you think about doing that, and how you plan to modulate your repurchase activity based on where your stock is?
Wesley G. Bush: Joe, it's Wes. I touched on this a little bit in my remarks, and I think it's important to be clear about how we think about this. As I said in my remarks, we are a long-cycle business and when we think about this, we're looking at longer-term value. We're a business that generates good cash flows. And as we assess how that's going, in terms of how the market is valuing our shares, we play that directly into our own model of long-term value creation. And our assessment is that share repurchases have, continue to be, a very, very good use of our cash. In fact, as I pointed out in my remarks and as we announced a few weeks ago, the board increased our remaining share repurchase authorization to $2 billion to make sure that we've got appropriate flexibility as we go forward. So we continue to look at share repurchase as a very good use of our cash. We clearly compare that to all the other alternative uses. And first and foremost, we always make sure that we're investing appropriately in our business to make sure that we are realizing that the opportunities that are represented by the strength of our portfolio. So that is always our primary thinking. We pay a lot of attention to our pension plan to make sure that it is in good funding condition, and we continue to do that, you saw that just here in the quarter we made an additional investment in our pension plan. And I think we've been in a good place on our dividend, we raised our dividend 10% this year. And when we mix all those things together, we like what we've been doing on share repurchase. We do think it is a very good use of our -- of the cash flows that we're generating. And like the opportunity that it presents for value creation in our company. Jim, was there any other perspective you'd like to add to that?
James F. Palmer: I would just reiterate your comments. We continue to have a balanced cash deployment strategy, investing in the business, managing our balance sheet and returning any excess cash to our shareholders. And traditionally, our dividend and share repurchases kind of have been in a 20% ratio for dividends, the balance in share repurchases, if you look back over a quite a bit, a long period of time, absent last year's large share repurchases after the spinoff of Shipbuilding. So -- you and I are in the same place.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard from RBC Bank.
Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: I'm not sure if it was Jim or Wes, one of you mentioned about the shorter cycle areas of your business being a bit weak in the quarter. I was wondering if you could quantify maybe how much this might be down, and if you expect this to perhaps catch up at some point in the future? And also, if you're seeing increased competition in some of these short cycle areas?
James F. Palmer: Actually, book-to-bill ratios in the -- both on a quarter and a year-to-date basis are essentially around 1, or above 1, and I think in all of our businesses, except TS, we're at 0.97 on a year-to-date basis. So frankly, compared to last year, at this point in time, our book-to-bill is ahead of where we were.
Wesley G. Bush: Yes, I think one of the comments we made earlier was, as we look ahead into the CR environment, we do have a little bit more concern about some of the shorter cycle businesses given the constraints on new starts, if you will. And the CR has been implemented, so that sort of programmatic funding issue that we would have, that I think would manifest in the shorter cycle businesses. But as I pointed out, it can even impact our longer cycle businesses at the point that programs are transitioning in some way that would be impacted by the constraints of the continuing resolution.
Operator: And your next question is from the line of Howard Rubel from Jefferies.
Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: You have changed your focus on bidding, it seems, Wes, and maybe for a moment you might want to talk about that? And it looks like it's impacting, maybe your capital spending as well? In a sense, it's much more information technology. It may be less capital-intensive, and more intellectual-intensive?
Wesley G. Bush: Yes, our focus in our bidding has really been to make sure that we are pursuing the business base that will be high-quality business for the longer-term, for the company. And your point within our Information Systems business is right on. We have, over time, transitioned that business from a business that had a much greater fraction of, sort of lower commodity businesses to a much higher end, more intellectual capital, much more engineering-content business. That's a transition that's been underway just these last few years, and I think that's serving us well. It allows us to be very thoughtful about where we are, applying our resources, both our capital as well as our internal R&D and then proposal investments. And it's allowed us to make sure that the businesses that we pursue there really have some form of competitive, sustainable, competitive differentiation that generates value, so that we're not just turning them over, in a very quick mode as we would often see in the lower end commodity businesses. We've been making that transition in Technical Services as well. And over the last couple of years of really fundamentally transformed the portfolio of businesses within something ES, to go after the areas that require more intellectual capital, if you will, around modernization or some of the training solutions. Or even in the services side of that, the areas that require the broader applications or the capabilities we bring forward as a company. So that transition has been underway. It continues, still, a little bit, but I think we've come much of the distance we needed to go to make that transformation. I like where it positions us in the marketplace when it comes to the areas of highest priority for us to pursue, the things that we've talked about extensively. Cyber Security is a good example of that. The modernization work that we're doing in Technical Services is another good example of that. So it's been an important shift for us. Jim, anything you'd like to add?
James F. Palmer: I'd just observe, Howard, that the decline in CapEx that you're seeing, you might remember that we moved from California a year ago, bought a building? That's probably the biggest driver in the decline.
Wesley G. Bush: Year-over-year.
James F. Palmer: Year-to-year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Cai Von Rumohr from Cowen & Company.
Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: So just a question on pension. It looks like, with your good return, your underfunding will be down this year. And so that, I mean, by my numbers, if the discount rate went up by something like 50 to 75 bps we might actually be fully -- very fully funded. And so, taking that into account, I mean, do you think it's a good -- do you plan on making more pension contributions next year if we kind of close where we are today? And if so, how do you view the attractiveness or lack thereof of being more than fully funded?
James F. Palmer: I think, Cai, I think there's an advantage to have a very well-funded plan. There are some practical limits to that as well. And so, if and when we see a move-up in interest rates that reduces the liabilities back to, frankly, a move back to more historical levels, you're right, that will significantly improve the otherwise underfunded situation that we see today. Given where interest rates are, not only is a 25 basis point move in discount rate, which we talked about being potentially 100 basis points lower, and contributing to the pension expense of $75 million to $80 million, a 25 basis points move to $750 million of liability, pension liability. So you're right in observing that a move-up if and when we get that in terms of interest rates, will have a significant impact on funded situation of the plans. And we do, just like with a view of the company, this is a long-term decision that we made for providing employee benefits for our employees. We need to think about it in that way. I don't have significant cash contributions. I don't have any -- it might require contributions next year, at this point, look to be in the range of, let's call it $75 million. So not a significant use of cash. But as we've mentioned before, when you think about our cash deployment across the total opportunity set that we see, we clearly want to invest in the business and continue our, I think, leading portfolio. We want to manage the liability side of our balance sheet by both investing in the pension plans when it makes sense. We have debt that matures in only the next couple of years, and so we need to be thinking about what we want to do there, whether we replace it or pay it off when that matures. And then ultimately, we'll return excess cash to shareholders. Our view really hasn't changed, and we need to think about the pension plan on a long-term basis, and if and when we do see changes in interest rates moving up, it will improve the funded situation of the plans and likely will have a similar impact on our required funding.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi.
Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I just wanted to drive down a little bit to get a sense from you on sequester and potential sensitivities around that. It would seem that shorter cycle businesses would be the ones that would get hurt the most, the quickest, given the fact that you've got annual renewals on a lot of contracts. And I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about it, whether you have visibility on -- kind of what percent of your firm's overall business would -- you would characterize as short cycle at this point, and would be subject to kind of the winds of sequester and the short-cycle nature of pressure that we might see?
Wesley G. Bush: So Jason, let me -- and I appreciate the question because this is an area where, as I mentioned in my remarks, there's a lot of uncertainty, first and foremost about whether or not sequester would happen. But then, should it happen, how that would all roll out. As I think I mentioned in my opening remarks, we would not expect to see obligated funding hit in sequester. It is, I think, the case that it would take a little bit of time for the -- each of the departments and agencies to sort through what they would need to do contractually as a result of sequestration. Just the pure mechanics of that process would be daunting, if I were putting myself in the shoes of our customer community to really deal with such a thing. So it's hard to predict. And so I wouldn't want to get too far off ahead of trying to predict how that would actually work out. But I do think that the principle that you indicated is probably correct, that the services businesses would, if a sequester were to occur and persisted for some period of time, would probably be impacted sooner, in that they have the higher turn rate of their contracting base. And consequently, they burn through the obligated amounts and they encounter a new contract decision more quickly. And also, the customer, more likely, would be in a position where it would be having to deal with those types of contracts sooner than the longer cycle development and production contracts. Although ultimately, if that sequester persisted, all of those things could be under a lot of pressure. So it's a little bit hard for us to come up with some percentages on that. We've done a lot of modeling for different scenarios. I wouldn't want to go on record pinpointing a particular scenario that I thought was most likely, because as I said, this is going to be a very, very dynamic environment. Should we find ourselves in that position of a sequestration actually getting implemented. And it's going to be -- it would be very, very tough on our industry, but I would also say it will be very, very tough on our customer community and the challenges they would face and the decisions they would have to take, none of us envy anybody being in that kind of a position.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland from Barclays.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Just to expand on that a bit, Wes, and you say you've evaluated a number of scenarios. I wondered, just to kind of be specific about something that's hard to be specific about, is there a scenario where the impact to revenues, earnings and cash in 2013 is greater than the cut we'd expect to see to DoD outlays in the event of sequestration if, as you stated previously, obligated funds on contract are unaffected. I would think it would be difficult to see an impact of that sort of magnitude, but I wanted to see if you'd agree with that based on what your evaluations of the scenarios show today.
Wesley G. Bush: Yes, I think ultimately, just if you think about the mechanics, there is the factor around the obligated funding that we mentioned and yes, that's sort of a consistent way of thinking about it. But there's also the factor, the real factor of just the time it would take for a turn on contracts and the rest of it. So it probably would not be an overnight thing. It would take a little bit of time to manifest. But the real problem, I would say, is not just an in year issue, it's the long-term impact that would result from the set of actions that would be taken, that would fundamentally disrupt programs and the industrial base in a profound way. And that's why, from our perspective, we've said it a number of times, this would certainly impact sales and profits and cash flows, but we are all as concerned about what it would mean to the stability of the programs, the stability of the industrial base, the people in the industrial base. All of the other aspects that would ultimately translate into the ability to deliver the National Security Solutions. So just working the mechanics of it, and there's a lot of speculation about how mechanics would work. Long-term, I don't think I'd have to speculate when saying that the impacts would be profound, and very, very negative. And it would take us all a long time to turn back the cycle on that. Jim, I don’t know if you want add anything to just some -- part of, from the financial aspects of your thinking on it?
James F. Palmer: All of which I, again, would agree with, and Carter, if you think about the nature of the accounting method percentage of completion, that we and the industry use, essentially significant changes in your cost structure have a cumulative catch-up impact. And so yes, I could imagine a situation where a change in cost structure or revenues by X amount results in a different percentage change in margins for the company or the industry.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Robert Spingarn from Crédit Suisse.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Apologies for this, but I want to continue in this direction, mainly because the irony is that while I think most of us think there might be a negotiated settlement here at some point. What's on record is the most onerous outcome. And maybe another way of approaching this, Wes, is how do we think about the dispersion in the outlay form of the FY '13 funds to Northrop, via the request over a chronological time period? So those funds the Northrop would receive, through the President's '13 request, if it were to go through, when do those outlay, in which fiscal years for Northrop? Is it 25% in '14, some number in '15 and '16? How do we think about that?
Wesley G. Bush: Yes, I won't go through the details of that. Obviously, it's been a part of our modeling. It varies, as you might imagine, by the different components of our businesses. Some of the monies that get appropriated, the actual outlays occur over several years, sometimes 2, sometimes 3, and some of the appropriated monies get burned up in the cycle. And you can imagine which of these businesses go with which. So there is a burn through of all of that. I think perhaps though, a bigger question is should our customer community find themselves in a situation where there's been either by overt decision or by failure of the Congress to actually change direction, basically a national conclusion that we're going to do something as draconian is implement a sequester. What actions will our customers have to stand back and do -- take from a broader strategic perspective? So there's kind of the mechanical part of outlays and obligations and all of that. But the real question at that point in time would be strategic. And what the longer-term implications would be of having to rethink a fundamentally much smaller budget within which to execute the national security mission, while the threats around the globe and the issues that our servicemen and women are called upon to execute continues to grow. To me, that's actually the bigger question here. It's not so much the in-year outlays and the implications of the mechanics in 2013, it's -- is where would that take us. And that's what I think we've -- we need to be mindful of.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research.
George Shapiro: I just wanted to get an update. I don't think you've signed a Block 4 contract. You haven't signed Block 5, because Lockheed hasn't either. So how do you decide what to book for profit when you're making these deliveries under those contracts? And then just one other one I'd throw in. Where do you stand with Block 30? It doesn't look like anything's happening in terms of canceling that either.
James F. Palmer: Yes, actually George, we're negotiated on Block 4 and 5. We're negotiated, so we have a good basis for thinking about marginal rates on the contracts.
Wesley G. Bush: George, let me take on the question around Block 30. We continue to work closely with the Air Force on all the blocks of Global Hawk. The Air Force has continued to fly the Block 30s and we continue to support the activity, and we continue to work with them to make sure that all of the capabilities and operational activities that are needed to continue to make that asset valuable to the Air Force and more broadly, valuable to the co-coms, are being implemented. So the category that we continue to work very closely with the Air Force and the combatant commanders continue to ask for the asset to be utilized.
Operator: And your next question is a follow-up from the line of Howard Rubel from Jefferies.
Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Jim or Wes, one of the other issues that's going to happen with the sequester, I guess, is the civilian workforce also would be cut very sharply. So that probably has as much of an impact on what would happen as anything else. Is that a fair way to think about it?
Wesley G. Bush: It's a very fair way and it's one of our very big concerns. Clearly, the civilian workforce and the DoD and the intelligence community represent an enormous foundation of knowledge and perspective in implementing the National Security Mission which we're all focused on executing. So the concept of a major reduction in that workforce would have very, very long-term implications. It's also a big concern beyond the DoD and something that I think is sometimes not illuminated adequately in this discussion around sequester, half of sequester goes to the DoD and sort of the national security side of the budget. The other half, fully, the other half goes to the other federal agencies. And so we're talking about impacting individuals who support Air Traffic Control, individuals who support all of the federal enforcement agencies and law enforcement agencies across the board. We're talking about potential impacts to food safety, to the activities that are underway to ensure that the nation is able to deal with diseases and epidemics. All those sorts of issues are on the table every bit as much. When you think about those other agencies, they don't have as large a procurement budget as does the national security side of the equation. In a sense, they don't have as large a procurement budget when they go to take this full 50% of the hit, it will translate into even greater impacts on the civilian employees of those agencies. So this a broader set of national issues and national concerns than just the defense community. And I think that deserves more illumination in the debate around the appropriateness of using this very blunt instrument of sequestration to address the fiscal challenges.
Operator: At this time, gentlemen, there are no other questions. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Steve Movius for your closing remarks.
Stephen C. Movius: Thank you, Frances. I think I'll turn the call over to Wes for his closing remarks.
Wesley G. Bush: Okay, thanks. Well, let me summarize quickly by saying again, we are very pleased with the performance of our businesses in the quarter and all the way through the year. Clearly, this continuing focus on performance, on cash deployment and on our portfolio is making an impact, is making a difference, and we are pleased with the outcomes that we're seeing this year. We certainly appreciate all of your interest in our company and thank you, again, for joining us on our third quarter call. Thanks, everyone.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes your presentation. You may now disconnect and have a good day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Northrop Grumman second quarter earnings conference call. My name is Chanel, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Steve Movius, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please proceed.
Stephen C. Movius: Thanks, Chanel, and welcome to Northrop Grumman’s Second Quarter 2012 Conference Call. We provided supplemental information in the form of a PowerPoint presentation that you can access at www.northropgrumman.com. Before we start, please understand that matters discussed on today's call constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which are detailed in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risk factors may cause actual company results to differ materially. On the call today are our Chairman and CEO, Wes Bush; and our CFO, Jim Palmer. Please go to Slide 3. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Wes.
Wesley G. Bush: All right. Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us on our second quarter conference call. This was an outstanding quarter in a challenging environment. Segment operating margin rate, EPS, cash from operations and free cash flow all improved over last year. And new business awards totaled $8.8 billion, a book-to-bill of 140% which increased our backlog to $41.5 billion. Our focus on superior program performance, cost reductions and customer affordability, in combination with effective cash deployment, continues to generate solid financial results and create shareholder value. All 4 of our businesses performed well. Together, they generated segment operating income roughly equal to last year's second quarter despite lower sales. And segment operating margin rate increased 50 basis points to 12.5%. Earnings per share increased 4% to $1.88, and on a pension-adjusted basis, earnings per share increased 13%. Cash was also a highlight for the quarter. Cash from operations totaled $876 million, and after capital expenditures of $51 million, we generated free cash flow of $825 million. During the quarter, we continued to execute our balanced cash deployment strategy. In the second quarter, we repurchased 4.9 million shares of common stock for approximately $295 million. Year-to-date repurchases totaled 9.3 million shares for approximately $560 million. We also announced a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend in the second quarter. Maintaining a competitive dividend payout ratio on a pension-adjusted basis continues to be a priority in our cash deployment strategy. Year-to-date, we've returned $820 million to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, which is consistent with our pattern of returning more than 100% of free cash flow to our shareholders over the last several years. Turning to guidance. Based on our year-to-date results, we're increasing 2012 earnings per share guidance to a range of $7.05 to $7.25 from the prior range of $6.70 to $6.95. Our sales guidance for the year is unchanged. 2012 guidance assumes a continuing resolution in the fourth quarter, but our guidance does not contemplate extraordinary customer actions in anticipation of a potential sequestration at the beginning of 2013. We continue to see modest organic sales growth in key domain areas, which is being offset by our portfolio-shaping actions and lower volume for other programs due to ramp downs and cancellations. We continue to capture new business in our key focus areas of C4ISR; Unmanned; Cyber; and Logistics and Modernization based on our competitive discriminators in these areas. Our $8.8 billion in new awards included several large awards in our strategic focus areas. These include: $1.6 billion for NATO AGS; as well as multimillion dollar contracts for the next-generation Fire Scout unmanned helicopters; F-16 airport fire control radars for Thailand, Iraq and Oman; Cybersecurity projects; and a contract to upgrade the U.S. Air Force's electronic attack pods. We also recorded $1.4 billion in awards for the James Webb Space Telescope. This quarter's awards resulted in a 6% increase in our total backlog. So overall, it was a very good quarter. But as we look ahead, we see an increasing risk profile due to budget uncertainty. This uncertainty becomes more critical as we progress through the year, and we recognize that it's also a major area of concern for all of our stakeholders. As the government formulates future Defense budgets, we are preparing for various potential scenarios, including sequestration. Like others in our industry, we are very concerned about sequestration's serious negative consequences for national security and the Defense Industrial Base, and the shareholders, customers, employees, suppliers and all the communities that rely on the Defense Industrial Base. While we've not received planning guidance from the government on how sequestration would be implemented, we are developing contingency plans. There are many variables in how the law could be implemented that will determine the specific impacts. However, we expect that as currently provided for under the Budget Control Act, sequestration would result in lower revenues, profits and cash flows for our company. We appreciate the work that some in Congress are undertaking to ensure the capability and readiness of our nation's military under the specter of a potential sequestration. We believe that a solution that avoids sequestration and its destructive impacts is in our best national interest. In addition to sequestration, we're also planning for various other budget scenarios, all of which call for a heightened focus on innovation, cost reductions and customer affordability initiatives. Over the last several years, we've improved our performance for shareholders and customers by driving program performance, reducing costs and enhancing our portfolio alignment. Our year-to-date results demonstrate the positive impact these actions are having on our existing portfolio of contracts. They also position us to compete in a more challenging environment. We believe that we're taking the right steps in the current environment and that we can continue to create value for our shareholders by remaining focused on our key priorities: performance; effective cash deployment; and portfolio optimization. Now before I turn the call over to Jim, I want to provide some perspective on Monday's leadership succession announcement. These organizational changes take effect in 2013 and are the result of thoughtful and thorough succession planning as well as extensive internal leadership development. We decided to announce these changes now in order to enable a seamless leadership transition over the next 5 months. At Aerospace and Electronics, Gary Ervin and Jim Pitts each informed me of their intention to retire, Jim at the end of this year and Gary in the first quarter of next year. Both Gary and Jim are outstanding leaders whose contributions to Northrop Grumman, our industry and our nation's security are too numerous to name here. I want to personally thank Gary and Jim for their support and their leadership over these past several years. They have been instrumental in achieving the superior program performance and affordability improvements demonstrated in our financial results. Linda Mills, the President of Information Systems, will join the corporate office as Corporate Vice President for operations. Linda has done an outstanding job at Information Systems, both in shaping our portfolio and improving financial performance. In her new role, she will have a focus on our operational efforts that we have underway across the company to support our drive for sustained performance, even as our environment becomes more challenging. Gary, Jim and Linda will continue to lead their organizations through the end of the year, which will support a smooth transition for our incoming sector leadership, all of whom are current Northrop Grumman leaders. Tom Vice, the current President of Technical Services, will become President of Aerospace Systems. Tom joined what is now Northrop Grumman's Aerospace sector in 1986 as an engineer on the B-2 program. He's held a variety of AS leadership positions of increasing responsibility in operations and program management as well as business development. Before assuming the TS Presidency, Tom led the Aerospace Systems Battle Management and Engagement Systems Division, which encompass the E-2, LEMV and BAMS programs. And he also served as Vice President for Navy Airborne Early Warning and Battle Management Command and Control programs. Gloria Flach, current President of Enterprise Shared Services, will become President of Electronic Systems. Gloria joined our Electronics business in 1981 and held numerous positions of increasing technical and management responsibility before leading our Shared Services organization. Just before assuming her current role at ESS, Gloria was Vice President and General Manager of the ES Targeting Systems Division and she also served as the Vice President and General Manager of Engineering and Logistics for Electronic Systems, which included executive responsibility for engineering and manufacturing operations and logistics services across the ES sector. Linda, Tom and Gloria are current members of Northrop Grumman's Corporate Policy Council, which is our senior leadership team, and as such, they will provide additional continuity to the management of the company in their new roles. Kathy Warden will become President of Information Systems. Kathy currently leads Information Systems Cyber Intelligence Division, which provides cyber capabilities to national and military intelligence programs. Kathy joined Northrop Grumman in 2008 as Vice President, Strategic Initiatives, where she was responsible for ISR market strategies, including key growth campaigns in cyber and intelligence information sharing. Kathy joined Northrop Grumman after having worked at another defense company as well as having worked in the commercial sector. Her breadth of experience is well aligned with the breadth of market focus at IS. With the transition of Tom Vice to Aerospace Systems, Chris Jones will lead Technical Services. Chris currently leads the Integrated Logistics and Modernization Division at ES. Chris joined Northrop Grumman in 2004 as the Director of product support and international programs for the Airborne Early Warning Program at AS. He managed personnel located in several U.S. states and countries and was responsible for all domestic E-2 Hawkeye support and international E-2 programs. In addition to his program execution responsibility, he also was a key member of the business strategy development and capture teams. In addition to these changes in our sector leadership, Mark Caylor, our Treasurer, will assume the presidency of Enterprise Shared Services. And Prabu Natarajan, Vice President of Tax, will continue with those responsibilities and also take on treasury responsibilities. Dave Perry, whose appointment is effective immediately, will become Corporate Vice President and Chief Global Business Development Officer. Dave previously served as Vice President and General Manager of the Naval and Marine Systems division and Electronic Systems. Each of the individuals chosen to lead our businesses has broad and deep industry experience and superior expertise and domain knowledge in their business areas. One of Northrop Grumman's strengths is our leadership bench and we are fortunate to have such talented leaders within Northrop Grumman to take on these roles. All of these individuals have been important contributors to the operational performance improvement we've achieved over the last several years and I'm looking forward to accomplishing even more as we move ahead next year. So now I'll turn the call over to Jim for a more detailed discussion of results and guidance. Jim?
James F. Palmer: Thanks, Wes, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. The highlights for the quarter were the strong new business awards and our 12.5% segment operating margin rate, which combined with share repurchases, generated a 13% increase in pension-adjusted earnings per share. On a pension-adjusted basis, operating income was comparable to last year's second quarter and pension-adjusted operating margin rate increased 50 basis points to 11.8%. Operating income for the quarter included a $64-million reduction in the net FAS/CAS pension adjustment. Our improved results reflect, in part, the aggressive cost reductions we've taken to improve our affordability in anticipation of likely budget declines. We are realizing the benefit of those cost reductions on our existing backlog of contracts. Based on our year-to-date performance, we now expect a 2012 segment operating margin rate in the high 11% range with a total operating margin rate in the mid 11% range. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was equal to last year's at 34% and we continue to expect an effective tax rate of 33.75% for the year. We do not assume an extension of the R&D tax credit in that guidance for tax rate. As Wes mentioned, cash results for the quarter were outstanding and reflect lower retirement benefit funding, as well as lower working capital requirements than in the prior year period. Our team's efforts to accelerate cash flow within the year are yielding benefits. However, we still expect cash flow to be weighted towards the second half of the year, as is our typical pattern. Guidance for cash from operations is unchanged at $2.3 billion to $2.6 billion and we continue to expect free cash flow to range from $1.8 billion to $2.1 billion. Turning to the sectors. Sales in Aerospace Systems declined by $69 million or 3%. Adoption of the units of delivery revenue recognition method for the F-35 LRIP 5 contract impacted sales by approximately $30 million this quarter. The loss of the DWSS sales due to its cancellation last year also impacted year-over-year sales by about $56 million. F-18 volume was lower due to 2 fewer deliveries this year and B-2 volume declined, reflecting reduced modernization efforts on that platform. Lower volumes for each of these programs more than offset the higher sales in the E-2D program and our Unmanned programs. Aerospace operating income declined by 9% and resulted in an operating margin rate of 12.1%, compared with 12.9% last year. The 2 major drivers of these changes are the transition to the lower margin multi-year 3 contract for the F/A-18 and the absence of last year's favorable imposed performance adjustments. For the year, we continue to expect AS sales to range between $9.7 billion and $10 billion, with a mid 11% margin rate for the year. AS awards totaled $5.1 billion this quarter, which brings our total backlog up to nearly $21 billion. In Electronic Systems, sales declined by $47 million or 3%, reflecting the de-emphasis of our domestic Postal Automation business, which had reduced sales by $34 million. We also experienced lower volume for international Postal Automation, laser systems and infrared countermeasures. Declines in these areas were partially offset by higher volume in our Space business programs. ES operating income declined by 3%, consistent with sales, and the margin rate for the quarter was comparable to last year at 15.8%. For the year, we continue to expect ES revenues of $6.9 billion to $7.2 billion, but we are increasing our ES margin rate guidance from mid 14% to low-to-mid 15%. This guidance reflects a margin rate of approximately 14% for the second half of the year, roughly in line with our original ES guidance for the year. At Information Systems, sales declined by $175 million or approximately 9% on a year-over-year basis. The cancellation of the JTRS AMF program as well as the wind-down of the F-22 and last year's sale of the County of San Diego IT outsourcing contract altogether impacted sales by approximately $75 million. The balance of the sales decline reflects the general market softening due to the uncertainty of the budget environment and the shorter cycle nature of our IS business. Despite the lower sales, Information Systems' operating income increased by 7% and operating margin rate expanded 160 basis points to 10.9%. Favorable performance on civil systems programs more than offset the impact of the lower volume. For the year, we continue to expect IS sales of $7.4 billion to $7.6 billion. Although based on year-to-date results, I think 2012 sales will likely trend towards the lower end of that range. And we now expect 2012 operating margin rate at IS of approximately 10%, which is an increase from our prior guidance of mid 9%. Turning to Technical Services. Second quarter sales increased slightly during the quarter due to higher volume for Integrated Logistics and Modernization programs. This more than offset the impact of portfolio-shaping actions and lower ICBM volume. Operating margin rate expanded 150 basis points to 9.5%, principally due to a favorable performance adjustment for risk mitigation on a Department of Homeland Security contract. For the year, we now expect TS sales of approximately $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion with a mid 8% operating margin rate. So on a consolidated basis, our 2012 sales guidance remains unchanged at $24.7 billion to $25.4 billion. But based on the first half results, we are increasing our guidance for segment operating margin rate to high 11% from mid 11%, and total operating margin rate is increased to mid 11% from low 11%. We now expect our share repurchases to reduce our annual weighted average share count by approximately 10% versus the prior assumption of 9%. And as well we disclosed in our 10-Q filing, second quarter net cume catch-up adjustments were $222 million, which is an increase of $21 million from the prior year. The improvement reflects a slightly higher level of positive adjustments as well as a slightly lower level of negative adjustments than in the prior year. The improvement is the result of our risk management process and affordability initiatives. Individually, none of the contract adjustments were material. Before we begin the Q&A session, I just thought I'd take a few moments and talk about the impact of the pension relief legislation that was recently passed in the highway bill. As many of you may know, the legislation impacts the timing of mandatory pension contributions. Our analysis indicates that our mandatory contributions will decrease over the next 3 years and then those deferred contributions are paid back over the following 5 to 6 years. We estimate that the law reduces our otherwise required cumulative contributions for the years 2013 through 2016 by approximately $1.5 billion on a pretax basis or about $900 million on an after-tax basis. The change in law does not impact 2012 required contributions of $65 million. Now we want to maintain the financial health of our benefit plans. We view it as a competitive advantage for us. So depending upon investment performance or tax planning strategies, we may elect to use some of this additional future cash flow provided by the legislation to voluntary fund our plans. So in closing, our second quarter results demonstrate just outstanding operational performance. We remain focused on generating shareholder value through performance improvement, effective cash deployment and portfolio optimization. So Steve, I think with that introduction, we're ready for some Q&A.
Stephen C. Movius: Thanks, Jim. Chanel, we are ready to begin the Q&A process.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: In the past, you had said there would be about a $500 million impact this year from the combined impact of the change on the F-35, LRIP 5 and portfolio shaping. Can you just talk a little bit about that? I'm trying to just understand at what point do I look at your revenue year-over-year and say, "This is what the organic trend is versus the portfolio shaping." When do we anniversary all of that? And do you still feel comfortable at $500 million is the right number for this year?
James F. Palmer: Yes, I'm trying to remember. I don't think the F-35 alone, the transition to units of delivery accounting was $500 million. I think it's more like a couple hundred million. And essentially, the revenue will start reversing here in the -- in second half of the year as we begin deliveries on LRIP 5. The balance was portfolio shaping and other actions, but the F-35 itself units of delivery was a couple hundred million dollar impact on 2012.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mr. Carter Copeland, Barclays.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I just -- Wes, I'm interested in your comments around sequestration and the various scenarios you're planning for. I wondered if you might speak to some of the differences in those scenarios, what some of the key factors are and that you are looking at and judging the potential severity of some of these impacts. Any color would be helpful.
Wesley G. Bush: Yes, we're in a just a fascinating situation here today. We have this law on the books that mandates that sequestration will occur on January 2, so that's the law. And I want to be clear that we will be ready to address that environment should that occur, but as I said in my remarks, that environment would represent lower revenues, profits and cash flows for our company. That said, we also know that the President and the Secretary of Defense, and to a very large extent, the leaders of both parties in Congress have said they do not want sequestration to occur. So exactly how this is going to play out is anybody's guess right now. And there are a lot of different scenarios floating around and everybody has their own view as to what might happen and when such things might happen. What we're doing is making sure that we're ready, and that means both planning for a variety of scenarios, both the sequestration scenario itself as well as other scenarios that might involve potential compromise positions on the part of the different parties that are taking part in this debate. We're doing that so that we're ready for a variety of outcomes. And we're doing it mindful that as we are making those plans and actually taking steps today to make sure that we're ready, we're doing that while ensuring that we're continuing to meet our customers' needs. And keeping all of that balanced as we go through here is going to be very, very important. The other part of this that's also very, very important is making sure that we're doing the right things to have a very talented and capable workforce for the future. And we're mindful of all of those dynamics as we are planning our actions as well as taking some actions today to preserve our flexibility and to make sure we're ready to really take this on however it goes. One thing I would point out that we see some constants in here and I think those constants, while we're all concerned about the coming months this year, looking past that at the longer term is really important. And one of the big constants that we see goes to the way that we've aligned our portfolio. We believe in just about any scenario, there's going to be a continuing priority for Unmanned capability, Cyber capability, C4ISR and this whole arena of modernization and its focus through Logistics and I see that, too, as being an important part of our portfolio for the future. So when we think about what's going on in the world, when we think about the environment that our national security customers are having to deal with, that part, I think, is a very important perspective as well. Trying to determine which exact path we're going to take to get to that longer-term just takes [ph] a little bit of a challenge, but we're going to be ready for it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mr. Howard Rubel, Jefferies.
Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: You have pretty darn good Information Systems margins. And Wes, I know you’ve worked very hard to have that portfolio, I'll call it, realigned, changed and you’ve sort of solved a number of problems there. Can we -- can you say that you’ve fundamentally changed it in a way that maybe your profit expectations for the business unit are higher?
Wesley G. Bush: Well, I would say that what we've done is we've changed it in a way to support the profit expectations we've put out there. If you turn the clock back a number of years ago, we had a fairly large fraction of that portfolio that was in what I would describe as more commodity services business. And today, if you look at the portfolio, and I have to give Linda Mills and her team the credit for this. They've just done an extraordinary job of managing their way through portfolio alignment here that it has a very large part of the content that is C4ISR and Cyber, and if you look at the parts of the portfolio that are more service-oriented, those typically have significant engineering content so we're bringing value-added and it's not a competition that's solely on the last penny. It really is around bringing the value of the engineering content. So those actions have given us the confidence to talk about margin rates that we put out there for this business as being the appropriate margin rates for the longer term, just given the broader character of how we've repositioned this business
Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: You mean -- it just seems to me that when we think about a government services business, this is really not that; it's something different and it fundamentally offers different value.
Wesley G. Bush: I agree, Howard, very much so. This does not any longer fit that model of a traditional government services business. And as you know very well, we actually spun out or sold off, I should say, the primary part of that business that we used to have, the task organization, and that was a big part of this portfolio realignment, was to take that out and put it into a different construct. So it's no longer a part of our portfolio.
Operator: Our next question comes from Doug Harned, Sanford Bernstein.
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: I was interested in -- Jim and Wes, you've talked about the cost-reduction efforts you've had and how that's contributed positively to margins. Could you -- when you look forward, I mean, the margins have been very, very strong in the first 2 quarters this year, particularly in Electronics. Now as you look forward, is there -- not just necessarily the normal margins, but is there more to come in terms of ability to get margin expansion through these initiatives or is this all, I would say, managing to a point where you're expecting some weakness later and we'll see margins revert back to a lower level?
James F. Palmer: Doug, as I think about it, we clearly have gotten some benefit from the actions that we've taken over the last few years, not just last year, but over the last few years. It's really been a concentrated effort, beginning going back to 2009 when we combined what was, at that time, 6 different businesses down to the 4 businesses. And in that process, we made some really significant improvements in our basic infrastructure cost. For example, I use 2008 as a benchmark. 2011 revenues were up 1% over 2008. Square footage, on the other hand, was down 6% and the infrastructure that goes with the business, largely people-related, was down 11%. So in a continual process to think about the business, the organization that supports it, the infrastructure that's required and you get the benefits of that on your current backlog of contracts, but it's very important that you do those things because it goes to the affordability of your products and then a down -- likely down scenario on a budget affordability is a key driver on being able to compete and effectively win. So we've gotten a benefit, at the same time, we have really emphasized the management of our individual contracts, identifying risk and opportunities. And our program management organization, I think, has done a really good job over that period of time, in a better position today than they have been in the past. So it's a combination of all those factors that I think lead to the improved performance that we've seen.
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: And when you look forward, do you continue to see some ability to improve on the margin side?
James F. Palmer: Clearly, that's what we incentivize our people to do and so we are driving towards that. I -- you may be asking about the long-term objectives, margin rates for the businesses. I continue to believe in those, that those are long-term margin rates that are sustainable through the cycle. Clearly, we want to do better than that kind of peer-average type margin rates and we're working very hard to do that. It's interesting they -- we normally get a lot of questions around cume catch-up adjustments and having spent a lot of time with us over the last 5 or 6 quarters and many times those items relate to either contractual issues or maybe some testing issues associated with individual contracts that largely are not resolved until the contracts are fairly well complete. So -- and at that point in time, you feel comfortable in making those adjustments and recognizing them. But that having completed or largely completed, these contracts does not necessarily imply that those will be the margin rates on a go-forward basis. So I guess a long way -- winded way of saying I feel comfortable about our guidance for the year, obviously, as well as our long-term margin objectives for the company and we will clearly work to do better than that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jason Gursky with Citi.
Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Jim, I've got just a quick question, following up on a statement that you made earlier about the competitive positioning of Northrop relative to competitors, given your pension position. The question is, I guess, twofold. One, I know that starting on February 27 of this year, yourselves as well as some of your competitors were able to begin booking higher rates -- higher billable rates into the government. So I just want to get a sense of what type of activity you're seeing on that front from success or lack of success in being able to do that? And then the second part of the question is where do you think this is going to have the most impact as you look at your various businesses? Does it weight toward services, where you get the competitive advantage, or is it Electronic Systems? If you could just give us a sense of where you think this competitive advantage is going to have the biggest impact, I'd appreciate that.
James F. Palmer: Yes. You're referring to CAS harmonization, Jason, just to make sure everyone is up-to-date on it; and CAS harmonization actually serves to increase everyone's CAS cost, everyone in the industry's CAS cost in relation to what they had previously. So it is a factor that allows us to recover those increased costs but it does also drive to the competitive nature of the affordability of our cost. So it's great that we're able to recover those increased CAS costs, but it is an affordability negative and so we are working real hard to offset that. In terms of the competitive nature, obviously to the extent that your plans are better funded than industry as a whole, your costs are less on a go-forward basis and so that is something that, as I've said, we've worked really hard to address over the past years, either through our investment performance, which has been positive. I think our investment management organization has done a really good job in relationship to the uncertain investment environment that we've had over the last 3 or 4 years. It's certainly been a difficult environment, but they've done very well in terms of performance versus the major indices, all of which, again, go to reducing our costs on a go-forward basis. So it's a combination of all of those factors, Jason, that I think is a competitive advantage for us on a go-forward basis. Although, as I said, it's great to recover that increased CAS cost, but it does become a negative that we're working hard at try and offset.
Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Which business do you think it's going to have the most impact on for you?
James F. Palmer: It's really going to depend on individual plans. We talk as if this is a huge one plan, when in reality we have about 20 different plans. So it depends on the funded status of each plan, but the area that we're most focused on has been the Aerospace segment, largely because the plans that support that have historically been very well funded and for many years did not have any CAS cost at all so we're dealing with that in our Aerospace segment, largely. But it does affect some of the other segments as well, both ES and IS.
Operator: Our next question comes from Cai Von Rumohr, Cowen and Company.
Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: So Jim, could you update us a little bit thinking about pension for next year. First, how was -- just 2 general questions. What's your investment performance year-to-date? And secondly, given that discount rates are down today from where they were at year end, and I know it only depends on where you close out the year, what sort of leverage does that have? And I know you have kind of your own indices; how should we think about the change in discount rate and what that might mean for next year's FAS cost?
James F. Palmer: Yes, so Cai, the investment performance through June is, in round numbers let's call it 5.75%. So again, the organization has done a good job relative to the indices. They always tell me I can't annualize that number so I won't do that but reasonable performance on a year-to-date basis. And as you know, I think everyone knows, interest rates are down from where they were at the beginning of the year. We're probably looking at, if we were setting interest rates today, anywhere from maybe 75 to 100 basis points of decline. And just a reminder that, that sensitivity around that change in discount rate is that every 25 basis points change in the discount rate is, let's call it, $75 million to $80 million of a change in FAS cost. So if we were setting it today, we would be looking at a decline in interest rates, let's call it, 75 to 100 basis points. And that equates at this point to, if I can do my math here real quick, $300-plus million. But again, it's kind of meaningless to talk about this at a point in time that is...
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol, JPMorgan.
Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I was hoping to drill down just a little bit into ES. Margin performance, of course, of the company has been great. It's been, I think, particularly strong here, though. You have the 5 business areas you've laid out within ES and I was hoping maybe, either Wes or Jim, you wouldn't mind walking through the business a little bit and telling us where the margins, relative to the segment average, are above or below in each of those 5 units. And just maybe helping us understand a little bit the complexion, the profile of the segment.
James F. Palmer: Yes, Joe, I'm not going to do that because I don't want to get into competitive -- I don't want to give out competitive information here. The performance in ES has been strong in a couple of areas, in particular, but that -- having said that, that doesn't mean that the performance in the other areas are weak, if you will, as expected, but the performance in a couple of areas had been particularly strong.
Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Well, let me rephrase -- well, I was going to say maybe what we -- what I could ask then on that, if it's been a couple of areas in particular, you must have visibility on how much of that is sustainable. So as we look forward and we think about -- and we know your long-term margin target for the segment, but how much more opportunity is there to -- for performance adjustments in those couple of areas that have been really strong?
James F. Palmer: As I said in my prepared comments, Joe, the guidance for the year for ES essentially assumes a second half margin rate in the, let's call it, 14% range consistent -- actually a little bit better than what our guidance initially was for all of the year for ES. So we have brought it up a little bit but again, the performance adjustments, as I said, in many cases, tend to be towards the end of that contract life, reflecting the resolution of contractual issues or other kind of testing or acceptance types of issues, and if they occur towards the end of a contract life, do not have much of an impact on a go-forward basis.
Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: So the implication is that you think you've kind of reached the end with the first half.
James F. Palmer: The implication is, I think, 14% margins for the second half of the year is great.
Operator: Our next question comes from Myles Walton, Deutsche Bank.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: I was hoping to focus on a separate segment, Aerospace, for a minute. The segment’s had great bookings over the last several quarters, really the last 4 or 5; maybe even gets a boost on bookings from the Space area in the near term. So I'm just trying to understand, it sounds like a lot of the 2012 issues were anniversary-ing some things, whether that was ICBM or the change in accounting for F-35 deliveries or lower F-18s. Are those or other areas kind of headwinds to '13 or have we anniversary-ed those, and this kind of increase in backlog that was seen is putting in a pretty good posture for actual growth in a tough environment in '13 in that unit?
James F. Palmer: Myles, we're -- for example, on F-35, we're kind of in this sine wave, where we essentially had no sales or very little sales on the current production contract, the LRIP 5 contract, but we will have sales and margins as we go forward into the second half and '13 as deliveries on that contract occur. As I look at that business, I think that, that business is reflective of the long-term margin objectives that we've seen, that I've talked about for Aerospace. Clearly, they've had some benefits on their existing backlog of contracts from the actions that they have taken to streamline the organization at AS. That's had a benefit on this year's margins to the extent that -- and it's true the Aerospace segment has longer-cycle contracts than probably most of the other business segments, so we're going to see some of that benefit continue as that existing backlog of contracts is worked off. So again, I feel good about where the Aerospace sector is in terms of their margin objectives.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Yes, I guess -- maybe I'm misusing words. I was actually looking to backlog and the bookings from a standpoint of actual orders. The backlog’s risen 23% in the last 6 months and 25 in the last 12 months. And a lot of this -- and just focusing on top line, the sales headwinds you face this year, you have illustrated pretty well. So I'm just curious, I mean, '13 if I'm just looking at those 2 metrics, would seem to be pretty well positioned for top line growth and just wondering is there any pushback outside of the obvious sequestration?
James F. Palmer: Besides that, I would say no.
Wesley G. Bush: I'd say there's a good balance perspective here. Clearly, Unmanned continues to be a very, very important part of the portfolio. The manned parts of it, as Jim indicated, on F-35, we have to kind of see what the program outlook appears to be. We're going to have to watch how, even if we're not in sequestration, how some of the other budget decisions continue to get made as they affect other programs, both in Unmanned and Space side. So we're delighted with the robust growth in the backlog. I think that positions us very, very well for the future here. I just would not want to get ahead of potential budget decisions that may ripple through the process here.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Stallard, Royal Bank of Canada.
Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Wes, I have a broader question for you. As highlighted on this call, your margins are actually very strong. You've also brought down your headcount in recent years, and now the customer is paying a higher CAS rate for you. Do you think that there's the potential for political pushback as you and your peers try to avert the sequester as politicians point out that the Defense industry is actually doing quite well at the moment?
Wesley G. Bush: There's always a potential for people to misuse facts, I would say. If you look at our Defense industry, we only do well when we're performing well. And our customers have been very clear and I think we've all seen that in our contract negotiations over the last several years that we only have the contractual opportunity to do well when we perform well. And a lot of that's baked into the FAR. So when we think about our industry relative to other industries, we're not talking about extraordinary margin rates in the Defense industry. We're talking about margin rates that -- well, you can see what they are when you look across our industry compared with others. So I think if there are those who forget that connection between performance on programs and profitability, then you could say well, perhaps we're making too much somehow. But the facts are, as I've said, we only show good numbers when we actually perform well. And as Jim has been indicating in much of his discussion around our margin rates, a lot of this comes down to our ability to not only execute, but to look at things in advance and take the actions we need to be taking to manage risk on behalf of our customers. So I'm not overly concerned about that. I -- in interacting with the seniors in the Department of Defense, they are very clear across the breadth of seniors on the acquisition side and I would say on the policy side, that if we're performing, we ought to be able to make money. And clearly, if we're not performing, we ought to be penalized, and that's kind of where I see that discussion sitting today. Now clearly, when we get down to the contract terms and conditions, there's a lot of pushing back and forth on the specific terms around profitability and cash flow and many of the other terms. But all that being said, from a kind of the 50,000-foot view and a policy view, I think we're in a very reasonably place here, where that connection between contract performance and financial performance is a pretty straight connection. Jim, any other perspective?
James F. Palmer: Yes, I just want to clarify the -- Rob's CAS comment because essentially, because of the transition rules, higher CAS cost begin in 2014, not before.
Wesley G. Bush: Right.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn, Crédit Suisse.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: A couple of questions there, guys. Wes, you've had some of the best bookings so far this year and you talked earlier about abetting CR into your guidance but because of that and the difference in your service business, which you highlighted earlier, are you less exposed to the CR than some of your peers?
Wesley G. Bush: We have difficulty telling the degree of exposure of all of our peers, so I'd be reluctant to make a comparative comment in that regard. Clearly, our Information Systems business, and to some extent, our Technical Services business is a higher turnover business in terms of the rate of -- at which contracts come onboard and get executed and closed out. And so that higher rate on a relative basis between those businesses and our AS and ES businesses cause us a little bit more concern as we look at the CR environment. But we've actually gotten pretty good at navigating the CR environment and I'd say most of us around our industry have been dealing with this now for a while. And our ability to plan and forecast the CR aspects of the environment, I think, is pretty good. So I'm having difficulty answering your question with regard to others in our industry, but I feel pretty good about our own outlook and forecast in that regard. The challenge, I think, here isn't so much around the management of a short-term CR. I think the challenge is how does the framework of a CR play into the concerns around sequestration, particularly as we head into the fourth quarter. And part of the struggle that we're seeing in our customer community is that the political system, as I indicated earlier, is very focused around is there an approach that avoids sequestration? Is there a broader perspective that can be taken looking together at the tax law changes or the current law coming to effect at the end of the year, the issues around the debt ceiling and everything the country went through last year and struggling to deal with the debt ceiling? Is there a mechanism where all this can be brought together or not before the end of the year? And the customer community is trying to figure out how they do the right thing to navigate through all of this, so I'm not as focused on the CR in terms of its variability as I am on the potential variability of customer actions in anticipation of a potential sequestration and...
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: So at the very least, I think one of the things you're perhaps suggesting is we may see Q4 looking a lot different than Q3.
Wesley G. Bush: It's hard to tell. I wouldn't want to speculate on that. I would simply observe that there are environmental conditions that could potentially cause that to happen.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: And then just a final question on this for both of you. For Wes, are you seeing any difference in the way the services are obligating funds these days? And then Jim, do you think that cash collections could become a problem as we get to the end of the year?
Wesley G. Bush: Let me just say on the obligations part of it, our understanding is that the guidance to contracting officers is for them to continue forward now and we see them working hard to get things under contract. Clearly, there are some areas that are under more pressure than others, from a total budget perspective, and so they're struggling with this a little bit more than others. And so I'd say it varies a little bit across the portfolio, but in general, we see our customers working hard to hold everything together here.
James F. Palmer: On the cash collection question, I think probably the best way to put it with, whether it's debt ceiling, all these different things that we potentially could be dealing with in the fourth quarter, we have really emphasized, as I said in my comments to our team, the importance of aggressively working our cash collections, billing and cash collections on a timely basis so that we can accelerate all the cash, as much as cash is possible into the earlier parts of the year than when it traditionally has occurred. Again, since there's a lot of uncertainty around exactly what's going to happen and how it's going to happen, it's hard to tell whether or not cash collections are going to be affected in the fourth quarter, but the best medicine is essentially move everything up if you can.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: So it doesn't really impact your buyback plans.
James F. Palmer: No, I wouldn't think so.
Operator: Our next question comes from George Shapiro, Shapiro Research.
George Shapiro: I wanted to try and get at this margin question maybe a little bit differently. You had in your release that you got a lower margin on the F-18 multi-year as it transitions. Now it could just be for the transition, but I'm assuming also that the overall realizable margin is probably less on the multi-year 3 than it was on multi-year 2. If you could go through, is there a number that you could provide in terms of how much lower the margin potential might be on some of the new contracts that you're winning versus the current ones that you have in backlog?
James F. Palmer: George, the -- you're looking at a situation where multi-year 2 at completion, you obviously know what you ended up doing. You had a multi-year contract; you have the benefit of the multi-year and taking cost-reduction actions and affordability initiatives to improve the overall performance. Multi-year 3, we’re at the very front end, and so it's not unusual to have a much lower earnings rate on the very front end of a contract, particularly a multi-year contract before you've had the opportunity to implement a number of the performance improvements and affordability initiatives. So I think we're at a point in time where we're comparing something that is known to something that has been negotiated that is a good contract. But we have in front of us all those other opportunities that we can take to improve the profitability, and it's too early to call whether all of them are going to be successful.
George Shapiro: No, I recognize all that. My question really was you've seen what you did from multi-year 1 to multi-year 2, and my question really is, is the potential on multi-year 3 in that regard less? And also if I could generalize to all of your other new contracts whether the potential is less in terms of margin and what you've made or can make on the existing backlog, just to get a sense of the pressures you're feeling from -- if any, from the contracting people.
James F. Palmer: Clearly, the environment is a little bit more difficult today than it was a couple years ago and we're responding in terms of our cost affordability initiatives, and so it's hard to say whether each of those are going to balance each other out over the longer term.
Wesley G. Bush: But it really comes down to us to continue to execute on the contracts, to drive affordability just as we've been doing over the years. Each time we take on a contract, it's -- as Jim indicated, there's uncertainty as to how far we'll be able to go in performance improvement and affordability improvement over time. And what we're seeing is our team across the company working really hard on this and it shows in our results, and we're really proud of that.
George Shapiro: No, you've done a great job in showing. I'm just trying to get at how much steeper the hill may be going forward here.
Wesley G. Bush: It always looks steep when you stand at the bottom.
Operator: Our final question comes from David Strauss, UBS.
David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Back to margins, I don't think you've addressed this. You've gotten about 30% to 35% of your segment profit from cume adjustments in the first half. What does the guidance assume specifically in -- by the way, in terms of cume adjustments in the second half of the year?
Wesley G. Bush: A more normal level, if you want to call it that. Actually, if you look at the quarter, the second quarter, and you compare the cume adjustments to the segment operating margin rate, it's 28% this year, 26% last year. So there really isn't that big a change in terms of the cume catch-up adjustments as a percent of the overall segment margin rate. So overall margins in the second half, in terms of my guidance, is a little lower. That's true, which essentially implies a little less of those potential favorable adjustments. But we'll go through a process every quarter of looking at our estimates at completion and making the adjustments, if necessary, up or down to reflect the actual -- what we see is actual performance and resolution of any risk and opportunities at that point in time.
David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: And then one on the revenue side. I think when you started the year, you talked about having about $700 million in contingency or cushion in your revenue guidance. Does that still exist or do you aim into that and does that specifically relate to assuming a continuing resolution in the fourth quarter?
James F. Palmer: I don't recall any conversation around $700 million of contingency. There is $700 million of variance in the range, if you will, $24.7 billion to $25.4 billion. But essentially, that range reflects the possibilities for each of the 4 sectors and where we think they may end the year.
Stephen C. Movius: This concludes our Q&A session, and I'd like to turn the call over to Wes for closing comments.
Wesley G. Bush: Okay. Thanks, Steve. Let me just summarize by saying we had an outstanding quarter, reflecting our continued focus on performance. We face a challenging environment and we're certainly concerned about sequestration and the broader budget environment. That said, we have a team that is focused on creating value for our shareholders, our customers and all of our stakeholders, and we are prepared to deal with this environment. Thanks for your continuing interest in our company.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the presentation. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Northrop Grumman First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. My name is Dienna, and I'll be the operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Steve Movius, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please proceed.
Stephen Movius: Thanks, Dienna, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's first quarter 2012 conference call. We provided supplemental information in the form of a PowerPoint presentation, which you can access at www.northropgrumman.com.  Before we start, please understand that matters discussed on today's call constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which are detailed in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risk factors may cause actual company results to differ materially. On the call today are our Chairman and CEO, Wes Bush; and our CFO, Jim Palmer. At this time, please go to Slide 3. And I'd like to turn the call over to Wes.
Wesley G. Bush: All right. Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone. Things for joining us. We're very pleased with this quarter's results. We're off to a strong start for the year in a challenging environment. It's rewarding to see the positive results being generated by our team's continued focus on performance, affordability and efficiency. As we've mentioned on our last few calls, we've been working hard across the company to reduce costs and improve productivity, and those efforts are continuing to pay off in terms of our financial results and our performance for our customers. First quarter earnings per share from continuing operations rose 17% to $1.96, and on a pension-adjusted basis, earnings per share rose 31%. EPS growth for the quarter reflects improved performance across all 4 of our businesses as well as the positive impact of our share repurchases.  Despite lower sales, 3 of our 4 businesses posted higher operating income and all 4 sectors generated higher margin rates. Electronic Systems and Information Systems had particularly strong quarters. As a result, our segment operating income increased 9% and our segment margin rate increased 200 basis points to 12.7%.  During the quarter, we repurchased 4.4 million shares of our common stock for approximately $260 million. We plan to continue executing a balanced cash deployment strategy that includes returning cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Historically, our return of cash to shareholders has been weighted towards share repurchases, and we don't have any plans to change our practice.  Our 2012 EPS guidance assumes a reduction in weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 9%. We consider our dividend a long-term commitment to shareholders, and we evaluate our dividend as a payout ratio of pension-adjusted earnings. Maintaining a competitive dividend payout in line with our industry continues to be our focus. Now I'll provide a top level of our first quarter performance, and then Jim will provide some additional details. First quarter sales of $6.2 billion are consistent with our expectations and support our guidance for the year. Our sales outlook assumes a continuing resolution of the fourth quarter, but does not contemplate extraordinary customer actions in anticipation of potential sequestration.  As we discussed last quarter in providing a 2012 guidance, our portfolio-shaping actions and the adoption of units of delivery revenue recognition on F-35 LRIP 5 will reduce year-over-year sales by approximately $500 million; and changes to a number of our programs, including fewer F/A-18 deliveries as we transition from multiyear 2 to multiyear 3; cancellation of NPOESS DWSS; lower volume for B-2 and Joint STARS modernization programs; lower in-theater sales; and lower ICBM volume will have an aggregate impact of approximately $1 billion on 2012 sales.  Together, these factors reduced our first quarter sales by approximately $450 million with F-35 representing about $90 million of that impact.  We expect sales to be more heavily weighted toward the second half of the year, as F-35 LRIP 5 deliveries are expected to begin in the third quarter.  New business awards in the quarter totaled $5.8 billion, a book-to-bill ratio of 94%. We ended the quarter with total backlog of $39.1 billion, down slightly from year end, but a satisfactory result given program award delays.  Notable follow-on awards for AS include $919 million for the E-2D Advanced Hawkeye and $289 million for the F-35. ES received an $88 million FMS award for F-16 fire control radars for several foreign countries and was also awarded $332 million for LAIRCM. TS received $100 million contract to continue supporting the Army's 3-core Mission Command Training Center. Information Systems was awarded $122 million follow-on award for Counter-Rocket, Artillery and Mortar systems. Over the last 2 quarters, IS also has won several important competitions. These include CANES, a program to consolidate and modernize the U.S. Navy shipboard network systems to improve operational effectiveness and affordability across the fleet, the ground combat vehicle C4ISR suite and the Air and Space Operations Center Weapons Systems Modernization Program, called AOC WS. AOC WS is the Air Force's command and control center for planning, executing and assessing joint air operations during a contingency or conflict. These captures, along with the ground missile defense team award, represent future potential awards and revenue in the billions of dollars for Information Systems. They also demonstrate that our C4ISR domain knowledge, coupled with SBIR, is a growing, competitive discriminator.  These wins demonstrate our ability to apply our deep domain knowledge and differentiating technologies in innovative ways to produce affordable, lower-cost solutions that address multiple threats or have a multiplier effect on mission capability. In today's budget environment, our customers are leaning away from expensive, exquisite solutions. They are generally seeking the lowest-cost, technically acceptable solutions and our ability to innovate, in combination with our discriminating technology and competitive cost structure, has provided a real competitive advantage. Based on the strength of this quarter's results, we are raising our 2012 EPS guidance to a range of $6.70 to $6.95. Higher 2012 EPS guidance principally reflects this quarter's exceptional operating performance and is supported by an increase in our expected segment operating margin rate to the mid-11% level. I would reiterate that we remain focused on positioning the company for an increasingly competitive and challenging environment.  Deficit reduction is a critical national priority. We expect a significant amount of debate and dialogue regarding how the defense budgets will be impacted by deficit-reduction actions. While the outcome of that debate remains uncertain, we are formulating contingency plans for the possibility of sequestration occurring in January 2013.  I want to be clear that the implementation of sequestration, as presently mandated, could have a very serious negative impact on our company, our industry, and of course, on the defense capacity of our nation. In this environment, our challenge is to continue to anticipate our customers' needs, aggressively address our cost structure and continue to improve our operational execution and affordability. We continue to take actions across the company to improve our competitive position. And while customer spending is being impacted by budget uncertainty, we continue to see demand in our core integrated C4ISR, Unmanned Systems, Cybersecurity and logistics markets. We believe these capabilities will continue to be vital to global and national security.  We also believe that we can continue to create value for our shareholders even in an environment of constrained top line growth by focusing on our key priorities: driving performance, deploying cash effectively and optimizing our portfolio. This quarter's results continue to demonstrate the success of that strategy.  So now I'll turn the call over to Jim for a more detailed discussion of our results and guidance. Jim?
James F. Palmer: Thanks, Wes, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I'll provide a little bit more detail on our first quarter results, which obviously are a great start to the year.  The highlights for the quarter were the 12.7% segment operating margin rate, which combined with our share repurchases, generated a 31% increase in pension-adjusted earnings per share, an outstanding quarter.  Strong operating performance more than offset the impact of lower sales, a lower net FAS/CAS pension adjustment and higher corporate unallocated expenses. On an absolute basis, even with $71 million lower net FAS/CAS pension adjustment, total operating income was roughly comparable to last year, and the operating margin rate increased 80 basis points to 12.8%. Pension-adjusted operating margin increased 8% and pension-adjusted operating margin rate increased 180 basis points to 12.3%. For the quarter, we had a lower tax rate due to higher manufacturing deductions and somewhat higher other income, reflecting positive first quarter returns on assets related to some of our nonqualified benefit plans. And finally, weighted average shares outstanding are 13% lower due to our share repurchases.  Cash results for the quarter were as expected and reflect higher working capital and higher income tax payments. And as we said last quarter, we expect cash to be heavily weighted towards the second half of the year as is our typical pattern.  We are maintaining our guidance of $2.3 billion to $2.6 billion of cash from operations and $1.8 billion to $2.1 billion of free cash flow for the year. Turning to the sectors. Aerospace Systems. Sales declined $210 million or 8% while operating income declined 3% due to the lower volume, and operating margin rate expanded 60 basis points due to improved performance. Adoption of the units of delivery revenue recognition for F-35 LRIP 5 impacted sales in the quarter by approximately $90 million and the NPOESS cancellation impacted quarterly sales by about $40 million. F-18 volume was lower due to 3 fewer deliveries than in the prior year. And B-2 and Joint STARS volume declined as modernization efforts on those platforms tapered off slightly. Lower volume for these programs were more than offset by higher sales for the E-2D and our unmanned programs.  For the year, we continue to expect AS sales in the range of $9.7 billion to $10 billion and based on first quarter performance, we are now expecting a mid-11% margin rate for AS, an increase from our prior guidance of low to mid-11%.  AS 2012 will be somewhat back end loaded due to timing of F-35 LRIP 5 deliveries. For the entire company, F-35 sales in 2012 will be about $1 billion. That amount includes F-35 volume for AS, IS and ES, with most of the sales being recognized at AS. Our guidance assumes about 1/3 of those sales will be recognized in the first half of the year and the balance, or 2/3, in the second half of the year. Electronic Systems saw sales decline by $84 million or 5%, primarily due to a $90 million decline in post-automation volume, largely reflecting the final delivery of systems under the Flats Sequencing Systems contract with the U.S. Postal Service and our decision to deemphasize the domestic postal automation business going forward.  Despite lower sales, ES operating income increased $67 million or 28%, and their margin rate for the quarter was 17.6%. ES recognized a higher level of favorable adjustments on their contracts for the mitigation of contract risk, including adjustments for contracts completing or nearing completion than in the prior year. While none of these adjustments were material on an individual contract basis, in total they increased first quarter operating income by about $60 million.  The quarter's results also reflect risk-mitigation and cost-reduction actions that favorably impacted fixed price contracts, which are a substantial portion of ES business. While we expect the positive impact of our contract risk management process and cost-reduction and affordability initiatives to continue, we don't expect a repeat of this quarter's unusually high level of positive contract adjustments at ES. For the year, we continue to expect ES revenue of $6.9 billion to $7.2 billion, and we are increasing our margin rate guidance from the mid to high 13% range to the mid-14% range. This guidance reflects a margin rate in the mid-13% for the balance of the year.  Information Systems had sales decline of $181 million or 9%. The sale of San Diego contract, cancellation of JTRS AMF and in-theater drawdowns impacted sales by about $100 million with the balance of the decline reflecting general market softening due to the uncertainty of the budget environment and the shorter cycle nature of our IS business.  Operating income at IS increased 6%, and margin rate expanded 150 basis points to 11.1%. Favorable performance on several civil systems programs, as well as cost reductions from affordability initiatives, more than offset the impact of the lower volume.  For the year, we continue to expect sales of $7.4 billion to $7.6 billion for the IS business with an operating margin rate in the mid-9% range. I should also note that last week, we sold the Park Air Norway business, a business that is focused on civil air traffic management and that divestiture will impact IS 2012 sales by about $50 million, obviously contemplated in our guidance for the year. But also note that IS had a 3% increase in backlog with new business awards during the quarter representing 115% book-to-bill ratio.  Finally, for Technical Services, first quarter sales declined $81 million or 10%. The deemphasis of some of our base and range operations and lower ICBM volume impacted sales by about $50 million and the KC-10 volume was about $25 million lower than last year. Operating margin rate expanded 110 basis points to 9.3% due to the improved performance for several programs, including the KC-10 program.  For the year, we continue to expect TS sales at $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion, probably closer to the high end of $2.7 billion with a mid-8% operating margin rate. So on a consolidated basis, our 2012 sales guidance remains at $24.7 billion to $25.4 billion. And based on the first quarter performance, we are increasing our segment operating margin rate guidance to mid-11% from approximately 11% previously. Total operating margin rate guidance has increased to the low 11% range from mid- to high 10%.  As we will disclose in our 10-Q filing later today, first quarter net cume catch-up adjustments were $121 million greater than in the prior year period. The improvement results from our risk management process and affordability initiatives across the company. Individually, none of the contract adjustments were material. Our 2012 EPS guidance assumes $130 million of net FAS/CAS pension income, a tax rate of approximately 33.75% compared with our prior assumption of 34.25%, reflecting the higher level of manufacturing deductions in the first quarter, but not assuming an extension of the R&D tax credit.  So now, with 2012 guidance out of the way, let me spend a few minutes and talk about a subject that I think is near and dear to many of you, 2013 pension expense and the resulting net FAS/CAS pension adjustment for that year and then some of the key assumptions or sensitivities on those amounts. Holding the discount rate constant and assuming we achieve the expected long-term rate of return on our plan assets, our estimated 2013 net FAS pension adjustment would be income of about $250 million. It reflects about $590 million of CAS expense, obviously the difference being FAS expense. And of course, actual results will likely vary and we can't really predict what's going to happen with discount rates, which is, as you know, one of the key variables. So talking about some of those sensitivities. A 25 basis point change in the discount rate would have an impact of about $75 million on 2013 costs whereas 100 basis point variation around our long-term expected rate of return, which is 8.25%, has an impact of about $40 million. And I should point out at the end of the first quarter, our return on our pension plan assets was in the 5% range.  And finally, I want to spend a few minutes on cash. In the 10-K, we disclosed an estimated 2013 mandatory cash contribution of about $300 million. I should point out that this estimate is based on many assumptions, including the PPA interest rates in effect at that point at the beginning of the year. I think some of you may know that those rates change every month, so the actual amount will, in all likelihood, be different than that estimate.  So let me just conclude my comments by saying that the first quarter results demonstrated just outstanding operational performance. As Wes said, we remain focused on generating shareholder value through performance improvement, effective cash deployment and portfolio optimization.  And Steve, with that, I think we're ready for some questions.
Stephen Movius: Thanks, Jim. [Operator Instructions] So Dienna, at this time, we are ready to begin the Q&A process.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Joe Nadol, JPMorgan.
Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Jim, thanks for the expanded commentary this quarter. My question is on the Electronic segment where you had those great margins, and I heard in your comments -- your intro comments. Just wondering if you could -- if we could dive in there a little bit and if you give us maybe a sense of, at this point, the sales mix there from an international versus domestic standpoint, fixed price versus cost plus and I guess I don't know if there's a way to quantify the maturity level of those. Maybe give us a sense as to whether this kind of performance can recur.
James F. Palmer: Joe, I don't think there's any change in this quarter in the overall mix of the business or the international versus domestic content of the business. As I said in my comments, we continue to work really hard on our risk management process and affordability initiatives, the roughly $60 million of cume catch-up adjustments that I've highlighted in my comments were spread across a number of contracts, about15 contracts, none of which were individually significant. So I just -- it's just real good blocking and tackling and managing the business.
Wesley G. Bush: And Joe, I would add if you look at our projection for the year for Electronics, it basically suggests that the remainder of the year will be operating closer to the rates that Jim has talked about extensively in the past.
Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And then for my follow-up, Wes, you mentioned in your intro comments, in the environment and sequestration, I was wondering if you could maybe expand on that a little bit. Specifically, it sounds like DoD is going to have to start planning for sequestration this summer or at least early fall. Doesn't sound like the political process is going to enable a solution to this, if we get one, until after the election in November. So what are you doing, more specifically, to prepare for this? And how are you thinking about this with your guidance and the fact that the sales profile is pretty evenly spread, even picking up a little bit towards the end of the year?
Wesley G. Bush: Well, as I said, our guidance does not anticipate that our customer community would take any extraordinary actions at the end of the year. Should they do so, obviously, that could be an impact to us and everybody in our industry. I think, to put this in a broader context, my sense of the situation is those on the Hill that are putting some time and energy into this are thinking about it very responsibly. They recognize that allowing sequestration to occur would simply have a devastating impact on the ability of the Department of Defense and other government agencies to support the security of our country. And it would have clearly a very negative impact on the defense industrial base. And so, there is a lot of discussion, a lot of debate around how to deal with this ugly situation now. Despite all of those good intentions, as you point out, we are in election year, and I think the general view is it's going to be hard to see something meaningful happen in advance of the election. So calling it now on exactly how that's going to come out is difficult, and because it's difficult to call it, everyone that's on the receiving end of this, including our customer community and ourselves, are sort of forced into the situation of having to plan contingency plans for the possibility of this very terrible thing actually happening. So that's what we're doing from our side of the equation here in our company. We're thinking through, if this would actually get triggered, how would we respond. And that has a number of dimensions. It has a number of dimensions on the contractual side and it certainly has a number of dimensions on all of the components of the operations within our company. So it's not just a broad brush. It's work our way through it step at a time. And I think part of the challenge, and I'm sure you've heard others in our industry speak on this, that probably no one in government can be prepared for if sequestration is actually implemented as is currently mandated, the department will have actually little discretion on many things that it has to do with respect to the line item budgets. Translating that into contract actions is going to be very, very difficult and the response that industry will have to provide on those contract actions will, I think, throw the department into great turmoil and result in bills being sent in for actions on contracts that no one has planned for. So this whole idea that this was supposed to be a so terrible of an outcome that would force Congress to not go there, I hope that turns out to be the case because the consequences are very substantial. But we are, as I'm sure others in our industry are doing, getting ready so that we can respond to that effectively, do it in a way that hopefully helps our customers work their way through it, but also protects the integrity as much as we can in that situation, the integrity of our ability to perform our mission. It's a fairly comprehensive process.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Doug Harned, Sanford Bernstein.
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: You had several cancellations in the 2013 budget and some delays, strictly in the Aerospace side. But when I look at your results now, you're maintaining guidance there. Backlog looks reasonably good. Have you -- were you surprised by some things that some things would they have led you to lower your outlook a little bit either this year or I'd say next year?
Wesley G. Bush: Doug, it's Wes. I would say that going into the year, as we were formulating our guidance, we do what I think you should expect of us, which is to look at the whole array of possible outcomes from a budgeting perspective and really think our way through that in our guidance. And so I think if you look at how the outcomes are abounded and once we actually did see the President's budget, it fit pretty well within the range that we expected. So we don't like all of those outcomes, of course, and as you know, there are many of them that we are working very diligently with our broad customer community to address. But so far, I think what we're seeing works with the guidance that we gave.
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: And then within Aerospace, if you look at unmanned, as we exit Afghanistan -- there'll be changes to unmanned missions. We've seen some -- also changes in the -- even the decision to go with the U-2 instead of Global Hawk based on costs. It looks like there are changes in the requirements of how they're thinking about them for the Navy UCLASS competition. Are you -- how are you looking at unmanned right now as a whole portfolio? I mean I think of you as the leaders in this space, but are you watching -- are you seeing shifts in it and the need to change anything about your strategy in that area?
Wesley G. Bush: Doug, I would say when we look at the military strategy that the Department of Defense, and in fact the President went over to DoD and himself introduced the new military strategy at the beginning of the year, when you go through that very carefully, it's clear that the range of missions that will be the priorities as we go forward and Asia Pacific gets a lot of attention in that regard and deservedly so, but if you look at the full range of missions, that the need for unmanned capability from our perspective is going to continue to grow. It is clearly the wave of the future. We'll go through some bumps of implementation and acceptance, if you will, in terms of which missions get translated over to unmanned on what time line. But I don't think there's anything that, actually over time, will hold that back. It is clearly the most efficient, and I would say cost-efficient as well, to address one of the points you made before, ways of doing a mission. It represents a much more manageable risk profile for the country. And just from a pure technological superiority perspective, with respect to our long-term defense aspirations as a nation, unmanned is the right answer. So we continue to see this as a very robust business. We continue to invest in it to ensure that we maintain our strength in this marketplace. And we really like the breadth of our portfolio, ranging from some very small little unmanned vehicles that we produce up through the rotary-wing capabilities to medium class and all the way up to the full scale Global Hawk and then BAMS. And when you look at even the ongoing discussions around the Global Hawk platform and its derivative on the Navy side, the strength of the commitment, particularly by the Navy BAMS, I think, reinforces our perspective.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel, Jefferies & Company.
Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: I have 2 questions. First, Wes -- maybe they're related. First, Wes, could you talk about how -- when we look at the proxy, what we find is that your -- the named executive officers have a market-adjusted compensation basis and it sure seems as if it's impacting some of the decisions. Could you sort of -- that you're taking with respect to portfolio optimization and so on, could you take a moment to talk about that?
Wesley G. Bush: Howard, I want to make sure I answer the question you have, and I'm not sure I understood it. The market-adjusted basis for?
Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: As I read the proxy, as I understand it, in addition to just merely meeting the goals that the board asks of you or the guidance, in addition to that, your -- there's an overlay that I think adjusts some the named executives officers' compensation to market returns of the entire group. So you have to not only make your numbers, you have to beat your peers. Could you talk about that in a context of portfolio optimization and other actions you've taken?
Wesley G. Bush: Okay, I get it. I think that's kind of 2 perspectives. One is as we set the annual goals for our performance, we do market benchmarking on those. And I think you've heard me describe before as we have been focusing on our performance within our company, we don't want to just be grading ourselves against ourselves in terms of performance improvement against where we've been. We really want to be measuring ourselves against the marketplace, which is what, of course, all of those who are thinking about holding our shares are doing. And so that is something we go through on an annual basis. We look very carefully at market performance and we set our targets on that basis. This has been a little bit of a change, and most companies or many companies set their annual targets based on their plan. And that is, I'm sure, a very good discipline in many respects. For us, it was my view and the view of the board, and quite frankly, the view of our leadership team that, that wasn't just the way we wanted to look at it. We really wanted to hold ourselves accountable to perhaps a little bit higher standard. So on an annual basis, we take a hard look at each of the metrics, both our financial and our nonfinancial metrics as well. We do a lot of benchmarking to make sure we have a good sense of where we are and where we want to go and we drive our metrics on that basis. The other piece of this is also on a long-term basis and you may also be referring to that. Our performance shares, that are the grants to our officers and our company, have a component to them that is measured on TSR. And of course, that's a relative measure against a couple of different benchmarks that we have in the industry. So the whole idea here is if we're committed to improving, it needs to be improving relative to how the marketplace is doing.
Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Yes, I get it. That sort of talks to it. And then just in terms of can you maybe cite an example or 2 of -- I mean obviously maybe the tanker a year ago is deciding that you didn't want 0 margin businesses as part of the portfolio was one example, but can you cite something today or a couple of instances today where that's the goal -- the objective is being translated into action.
Wesley G. Bush: Well, yes. I think it drives thinking across the whole array of decisions that we make as a leadership team. Clearly, we've been doing a lot of work on portfolio shaping across our portfolio. Some of that has been, I would say, more strategic in nature with respect to what actually fits and where there's real synergy. But some of it has been around what businesses do we really want to be in if we're not able to get the returns out of them, that we expect of the investments we make and obviously we think our shareholders should expect. So whether it's our decisions to whether to bid or not bid on a particular contract or our decision as to whether we want to be in a business or not be in a business, we're -- quite frankly, when we're looking at making our asset investments internally, we have that same mindset as well in that regard. So it's comprehensive. As everyone knows, when you create a way of measuring within a company, you're basically deciding what it is you value. And people respond to that, good people respond to that, and I'm proud of our team.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Cai Von Rumohr, Cowen and Company.
Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Yes, it's about your dividend. Your GAAP -- your pension-adjusted earnings based on your guidance look relatively level this year. Your dividend currently is $2 and I guess normally you'd review it at the middle of next month. So can you give us a little bit more color in terms of should we assume therefore the dividend doesn't increase? Or maybe give us a little bit more color in terms of how you think of your dividend in light of your overall cash deployment?
Wesley G. Bush: Well, Cai, as I mentioned in my remarks, dividend is very, very important to us. We do treat it as a long-term commitment to our shareholders and we think about it very carefully. And your right in with respect to our timing, we normally go through this kind of in the May time frame. I don't want to be in a position of getting ahead of that discussion that we're going to have. That's a discussion that's not complete within the company yet, certainly not with the board and we're going to go through that when we get together. But as I said in my remarks, we do like the relative weighting towards share repurchase that we've had in the past. I think that has served us well. And our guidance this year contemplates a reduction in shares outstanding, about 9%. So -- and that's all sort of to give you a little bit of illumination in our thinking. But as a company, we, I think, established a good, solid track record of looking at our dividend each year and having some movement in our dividend. So as I said, I don't want to get ahead of the discussion, but that's kind of a reflection of our history and our thinking.
Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Okay, and then one for Jim. You've mentioned the $300 million in potential required pension contributions next year. What does that imply regarding CAS harmonization and/or the transportation funding bill that would basically relax ERISA funding requirements?
James F. Palmer: As I said, first of all, CAS harmonization has nothing to do with funding. How much we have to fund in their plan it's all based on the PPA rates. If we -- and I'm aware of, of potential for a relaxation around those rates, I would expect that if we do see legislation to relax, that would move towards a longer-term view of those rates rather than essentially what is a average over the last 24 months in the current PPA legislation or rules. So all of that should result, assuming we get that relaxation, in a lower required contribution in 2013.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn, Credit Suisse.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Wes, just going back to the dividend and understanding what you just said, which is that that's an upcoming discussion and you don't want to get too far ahead of that. But when you talk about the ratio, and I look at the historical increases that are I think in the mid- to high single digits in terms of percent terms over the last 3 or 4 years, that leaves you a little bit below the peer leaders in the group. And I wondered if you could comment within -- in that context where you'd like to be relative to those guys or if it's better to be just at the average of the overall group, which is about where you are.
Wesley G. Bush: Well, it's part of the discussion that we go through each year. And I said, you can kind of look back at our history and see where that's come out in the past. But I really -- I think I've said all I have to say on that one given that we're kind of in the middle of thinking our way through it. So we'll have more to say, obviously, once we get to a decision on it.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Fair enough, fair enough. Obviously, it's an important topic here for everybody. Jim, a question for you. You mentioned that the adjustments in Electronic Systems, and I suppose perhaps this is elsewhere, were they were numerous and they were fairly small. I think you said 15 in Electronic Systems. But how could we quantify the largest of those, either there or perhaps in one of the other segments. Were there any that were approaching perhaps the $10 million level?
James F. Palmer: Rob, again, as I said, none of them were, in my view, material. I mentioned the $60 million that was made up of about 15 contracts. Frankly, if we look at the whole cume catch-up adjustment process, there's probably hundreds, maybe even thousand contracts, that are adjusted every quarter. So I stand by my comments. I just don't think that any of them were individually significant and the team has been real disciplined in the management process, the risk management process. And don't lose sight of the importance of the affordability initiatives that we have undertaken that has an impact on our forward margin overhead rates, which are important element of the operating performance in each individual contract. It is really essentially doing what you are supposed to do in managing your business.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Well, maybe this leads to a larger question, either for you or for Wes, which is this trend seems to have really taken on some momentum for Northrop and for others in that there's more margin here than there was before and maybe it's the specter of what's coming down the pike from a top line perspective. But perhaps you can comment on what it is that is enabling you and others to improve profitability at such a level today relative to a few years back.
James F. Palmer: I'm going to go back to Wes' answer to Howard's comments. We have really focused our team around managing the business, being prudent managers of the risk in the business and driving the organization, incentivizing the compensation of the organization to be well aligned with those management objectives. And we have the hearts and minds of the team. And we're really working hard on that overall risk management process and it's a difficult environment. It's getting increasingly difficult as we go through the last couple of years. But our team has really responded well.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Wes, do you have any comment on how long you can drive this process? Do you run out of headroom?
Wesley G. Bush: Well, I would also reflect back on our discussions on sustainable margin rates. When we look at the future, and quite frankly that's informed by the past as well, broadly across industry, we talked a lot about the sustainable rates that we expect that we can be achieving in each of our businesses. We've not changed any of those perspectives in our discussions. And as we go through the process of managing the risk out of individual programs, we will find places and opportunities where we see these nice opportunities to recognize that risk mitigation. One of our biggest activities in our company that's underway for a number of years was to really drive an increased level of discipline in the decisions we make getting into the contracts. And so, as we're able to trim out of our portfolio, either through managing the risk out of it or actually deciding not to take on some contracts that don't have as good a return opportunity, that clearly has helped us. And if you look back over the last 3 or 4 years, that's helped us a lot in terms of our performance level. But if your question is really more forward-looking, I think the descriptions that we've used around the sustainable margin rates that are sort of inherent in the businesses, assuming that we're operating them effectively, it's a good way of thinking about our company.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Myles Walton, Deutsche Bank.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: As you get closer to the end of the year and the potential for sequestration, Wes, you talked about some of the contingencies. But I'm curious intra- year, are we going to start to see behavioral shifts at you and the industry to kind of protect yourself? And what kind of moves, whether that's capital preservation or just general behavior would we likely see manifest?
Wesley G. Bush: I think what you're going to see first and foremost from our industry and certainly from our company is an absolute commitment to support our customers full throttle, and we're doing that. We take on contracts and those are commitments that we make. So we will not do anything that will impair our ability to support our customers and execute those contracts with every ounce of efficiency and focus on meeting our commitments that we can possibly bring to the table. And that's what our customers are doing, too, I would say. If you look at how the department is operating today, even with this ugly cloud that's out there on the horizon, the department has not backed off from conducting its mission around the globe. And I think we all have to admire that behavior on the part of the Department of Defense and the other government agencies that are having to operate with this uncertainty hanging over their heads. So we're all going to be going through what I'll describe as a planning process and a contingency process so that we are ready to take action, we're not having to figure out should it actually occur. But in a broad sense, I think it would be irresponsible of us to take actions that would somehow slow down or impair the ability of our company to meet our commitments. So that's the way we're thinking about it.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: And I guess to tie it back to the dividend discussion, does it any way hang over that discussion as well or do you see it as more of an isolated risk rather than part of the ongoing capital deployment strategy?
Wesley G. Bush: It's not really been a significant part of our thinking around dividend. Our dividend thinking has been more shaped by the parameters that I described a little bit earlier. The dividend, when you look at dividend as a total part of our cash deployment, it's not the live-or-die part of our cash deployment.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: The only other one, Jim, clarification, I guess, on the positive adjustments year-to-date. What's baked into the full year guidance on a year-on-year basis at this point?
James F. Palmer: Myles, I tend to think about it in terms of the overall margin rates for each of the sectors than the company, as opposed to x amount of cume catch-up adjustments. And frankly, cume catch-up adjustments is one of the factors in the margin rates, but it is not the only factor. It is the resulting margin rate that we recognize on a go-forward basis after those adjustments as well. So I don't think you can put a number on that. It's more important to look at the overall margin rate of the business.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. So I guess another way of asking it, the implied back half margins or the last 3 quarter margins of 11% versus 11.9% last year, can you -- is that largely cume catches or mix or something else?
James F. Palmer: Really a reflection of where we think the business is going to be, our forecast for this year.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky, Citi.
Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Two questions. Going back to the margins. Clearly, you've been successful in operating above what you've described as sustainable margin rate. So that begs the question do you -- your target margins perhaps represent the floor for you as you think about margins, or could we see periods of time where you are below that for a small period of time and above it for other periods of time? I'm just trying to get -- I think we're all curious as to how long you can outperform, so to speak, relative to your own targets or maybe those targets aren't really where you think you're going to be but rather a floor.
James F. Palmer: I tend to frankly think about those as targets through the cycle of the business. We do, as Wes mentioned earlier, spend a lot of time looking at our historical performance, our competitors' performance, our peers' performance. You can look at our performance in the past and some of our peers. We've been below and above those long-term sustainable targets. But again, given my background experience, looking across the industry at our major peers, I think they represent, as I said, sustainable margin rates through the cycle. There are times when individual organizations who have margin rates better than those and worse than those. Clearly, we have -- we're incentivized to try to drive our organization to perform as best that we can. We're being very conscious about the actions we take to manage our costs; to improve the affordability of our products; to manage the risk in our contracts; to make good, prudent contract decisions upfront. My experience tells me it's very difficult to overcome a bad contract. So we make, as Wes mentioned, earlier very prudent decisions about contract terms and conditions and estimates of costs when we enter into those contracts. So it's just the whole management process around the nature of our business.
Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay, that's great. And then just as the follow-up question. Can you give us a bit of an update on both the Global Hawk and the Fire Scout programs, where we are with Block 40 and just overall kind of demand in program development milestones on both those programs?
Wesley G. Bush: Yes, Jason, let me give you a quick update. Global Hawk, sort of broadly across the blocks of Global Hawk, all right, is continuing to provide absolutely superior mission performance around the globe. And as I mentioned in one of my earlier remarks, as we see an increasing focus in Asia Pacific, the notion of unmanned systems with long duration and extraordinary time on station really, really makes a lot of sense and we can see it in terms of the eagerness with which the men around the globe are utilizing the Global Hawks they have today and looking forward to the Global Hawks that they see coming down the line. With respect to the Block 30 issue that was illuminated in an earlier question, we are continuing to execute the contracts on Global Hawk Block 30, continuing to demonstrate strong contract performance. And we are working closely with the Air Force to sort out the path forward for that particular segment of the overall Global Hawk enterprise. I think you also asked about the Fire Scout. Fire Scout continues to, overall as a program, do very well with accumulated greater than, I think, it's 5,000 flight hours at this point and more than 3,000 of those are on operational deployment. There were 2 incidents over the past number of weeks and we're working closely with the Navy in their investigations on those incidents to really make sure we've got down to root cause and get that nailed down. I think if you've been following it, you saw that the Navy just recently stated that they do not believe that there were any systemic issues, but we really want to sort through that and make sure we've got all of the issues nailed down. We did just receive the ATP on the new Fire Scouts, the MQ-8Cs, and we got started off with 2 demo of the 8Cs as well as 6 production units. So we're continuing to see strong support for Fire Scout and the unique mission capability that it brings.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of George Shapiro, Shapiro Research.
George Shapiro: I wanted to get at this margin question maybe a little differently. I mean you've done a great job in executing it, pretty much saying what you're going to do in the business, Wes. But at some point, these older favorable contracts and the newer ones seem to have tougher terms. Your margins are higher than virtually anybody's seen in the industry. Now does the declines forecast, Jim, in your guidance for the remainder of the year suggest that we're actually getting to that point of crossover where it's going to be much tougher to get cume adjustments, or is it just your conservatism?
James F. Palmer: George, you're calling me conservative. In all honesty, George, if we knew that we were going to have earnings adjustments, we would be booking them today. So the nature of the process again is to manage the business. You need to continue to drive affordability across the organization. That goes to our cost, how well our suppliers perform, whether or not there are issues that we have to address from that side, the overall contract. Yes, the business is more difficult. Maybe that influences my view on what could happen here in terms of overall margins, but -- and I stand by my earlier comments. The team is really working hard, first of all, to make sure that we have an affordable cost structure; to be innovative in how we manage, not only the production process, the engineering process, all of which have an impact on affordability or the cost of the products. And again the management process around good deals to begin with is really important.
Wesley G. Bush: Yes, George, just one other little piece I would add to that is, as I said in my remarks and I know Jim did in his as well, we're working very aggressively on cost reduction in our enterprise. And we need to do that to support what our customer's needs are, particularly as their acquisition strategies have shifted more towards the low-cost, technically acceptable approach. We need to do that to be competitive for the long term. As we take costs out, there is always an opportunity for that to better support contracts that are already underway, but as you know, in our industry, when we go to compete and whenever we go through a new contract negotiation, the costs we've taken out becomes the baseline for new contracts. So that's also the part of our thinking as we look at sustainability and margin rates in our industry going forward.
Operator: And the final question will come from the line of Robert Stallard, Royal Bank of Canada.
Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: I just have a follow-up actually on George's question there. Do you get the sense that your customers are feeling a little bit uncomfortable with this sort of rates of return that you're now achieving, or are they more focused on other things such as price per unit as opposed to returns per unit?
Wesley G. Bush: Yes, I think that, ultimately, the customers are focused on affordability. And that's the price they're paying per unit. And in fact, if you listen very carefully to what is being said at the highest levels of the Pentagon, they feel good and they are able to enter into a contract that they deem, through their own analysis, to be very affordable. Clearly, it needs to meet the regulations of DFAR, but contracts that really incentivize contractor performance. And what you're seeing, and when we're talking about making positive adjustments, you're seeing contractor performance and that translates into benefits for the customer. They're getting what they're wanting out of these contracts. So to the extent that we are performing and making good margins, I think there's a lot of support for that particularly when it means that we are, in part, doing that because we are becoming even more cost competitive and we're supporting the future affordability of the defense industrial base. So yes, our customer's under a lot of pressure and not every action that's being taken in response to that pressure or actions that we like, of course. But I think, philosophically, and I base this on the direct statements that come out of the seniors in our customer community and I think these are very, very honest and direct statements, they like it when we perform on contracts and they're willing to have contracts that motivate us to do that.
Stephen Movius: Well, thank you. This ends our Q&A session. And at this point in time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Wes for closing comments.
Wesley G. Bush: Thanks, Steve. Well, I'll just wrap up by saying once again we really appreciate all of your interest in our company. We are continuing to focus on our key priorities as we've talked a lot about here: driving on performance, deploying our cash effectively and optimizing our portfolio for the future. Thanks, everyone.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you again for participating. You may now disconnect, and have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Northrop Grumman Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. My name is Erin, and I'll be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I will now turn the presentation over to your host for today's conference, Mr. Steve Movius, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.
Stephen C. Movius: Thank you, Erin, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's fourth quarter and year-end 2011 conference call. We provided supplemental information in the form of a PowerPoint presentation that you can access at www.northropgrumman.com. Before we start, please understand that matters discussed on today's call constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which are detailed in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risk factors may cause actual company results to differ materially.  On the call today, are our CEO, Wes Bush; and our CFO, Jim Palmer. Please go to Slide 3. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Wes.
Wesley G. Bush: Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I'll start this morning by first reviewing our 2011 results, then I'll address our outlook for 2012. Fourth quarter and full year results for 2011 were outstanding. They demonstrate that our focus on performance, portfolio alignment and effective cash deployment continues to create value. Despite the challenging top line environment, we delivered strong results by nearly every measure. Segment and total operating margin, earnings per share, cash from operations and free cash flow all were higher than our 2010 results. Our team continues to build on our strong record of program execution and performance, which is essential to meeting our customer needs for affordable, high-quality products and services. I'm very proud of how our team has come together these last several years to really drive performance improvements in our business. Achieving these improvements has required some tough decisions across our company, but these efforts have positioned us to be successful well into the future. Turning to our results, fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations more than doubled to $2.09 per share, and for the year, earnings per share from continuing operations increased 17%, to $7.41.  Segment operating income rose in both periods. For the quarter, segment margin rate increased 100 basis points, to 11.9%. And for 2011, segment margin rate expanded 90 basis points, to 11.6%. Pension adjusted operating income also increased for both periods. And for 2011, our total operating margin rate, adjusted for net FAS/CAS pension, expanded 90 basis points over 2010, to 10.9%. Cash from operations and free cash flow were outstanding for both the quarter and the year. Before discretionary pension contributions, 2011 cash from operations totaled nearly $3 billion and free cash flow totaled $2.5 billion. For the year, conversion of earnings from continuing operations to free cash flow, before the effect of discretionary pension contributions, was 120%. Our strong cash flow and the $1.4 billion Huntington Ingalls spin-off contribution allowed us to return substantial cash to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. In total, we spent $2.3 billion to repurchase more than 40 million shares, and at year-end, approximately $1.7 billion remained on our share repurchase authorization. We also raised our quarterly dividend by 6.4% last May, our eighth consecutive annual increase. And we paid our shareholders $543 million in dividends in 2011. Through share repurchases and dividends, we returned cash of $2.8 billion to our shareholders in 2011, 150% of our free cash flow from continuing operations. And through the Huntington Ingalls spin-off, we distributed an additional $1.8 billion of equity value to our shareholders.  During the quarter, new business awards totaled $7.1 billion, a book-to-bill ratio of 109%. For the year, new business awards totaled $25.3 billion, a book-to-bill ratio of 96%. We ended the year with a total backlog of nearly $40 billion.  Looking ahead, we remain focused on aligning our cost structure with our customer's affordability and efficiency objectives. Actions to date to support affordability have included consolidating business units across the enterprise, reducing overhead in our operating businesses, restructuring our debt to reduce interest expense, streamlining our corporate office and redesigning our benefit plans.  Looking ahead for this year, we expect 2012 earnings per share from continuing operations of $6.40 to $6.70. Our 2012 guidance calls for sales of $24.7 billion to $25.4 billion, double-digit segment and total operating margin rates, cash from operations of $2.3 billion to $2.6 billion and free cash flow of $1.8 billion to $2.1 billion.  Let me focus for a moment on our top line guidance. As we discussed in our third quarter call, our 2012 sales outlook includes about a $500 million impact from our portfolio shaping and the adoption of units of delivery accounting for the F-35 LRIP 5. In addition, approximately $1 billion in revenue reduction is driven by changes in a number of our large programs, including the DWSS termination, the transition from F/A-18 multiyear 2 to multiyear 3, the wind down of B-2 upgrade programs, lower in-theater sales and lower ICBM volume.  Beyond that, we expect growth of about 2% in our core portfolio, which brings us up to the top end of the range. This includes continuing growth in our Cyber business and unmanned programs such as BAMS, Fire Scout and Navy UCAS. From there, our guidance considers a range of uncertainty that recognizes the potential for additional program changes resulting from budget decisions and timing issues such as potential award delays, the pace of in-theater troop drawdowns and potential continuing resolution funding for the 2013 budget. We see this range of uncertainty representing up to about 3% of sales off the top end of the range. Based on Secretary Panetta's outline of our nation's new strategic security direction, we believe we are well-aligned with the priority investment areas to support a smaller, more agile, technologically advanced security force. We expect about 75% of 2012 sales to come from our 4 strategic focus markets: C4ISR, Unmanned Systems, Cybersecurity and logistics, plus our business focused on manned strike aircraft. While we were generally encouraged by the elements of the defense budget discussed by Secretary Panetta last week, including continuing support for our Global Hawk Block 40 system, the Navy's BAMS program and other Unmanned Systems such as Fire Scout and Navy UCAS, we were disappointed by the Air Force plan to cancel the Block 30 program on Global Hawk. We will be working with the Pentagon to assess alternatives to Block 30 termination that will ensure a more cost-effective transition into production for the other programs that are based on Global Hawk. Aside from Global Hawk Block 30, the elements of the President's budget introduced last week demonstrate an increasing alignment between Northrop Grumman's core capabilities and priority areas of customer investment. Overall, it validates the portfolio shaping we've done over the last several years to increase our focus on C4ISR, Unmanned Systems and Cybersecurity, and it also supports some of our long-standing core competencies in space and of course long-range strike. Cyber, both defensive and offensive, is one of the budget areas that is expected to increase. The DoD also expressed a strong commitment to the new bomber as a critical component of our nation's ability to project power in denied environments. The budget also protected funding for space systems, including the Space-based Infrared System and the advanced extremely high-frequency communication system. Both are programs in which we participate. And sea-based unmanned ISR systems such as our Fire Scout were specifically cited for increased investment. We also view this military strategy as supportive of our efforts to market our products internationally so that our allies can build their capacity to more effectively play an increasing role in global security. We expect the 2013 budget process will be long and contentious, with another continuing resolution likely as the administration and Congress balance the need for fiscal restraint with the need to protect against a wide range of national security threats. It's unclear how the issue of sequestration will be resolved, but we certainly share Secretary Panetta's view that the budget cuts mandated as a result of the failure of the Super Committee would seriously endanger national security.  Despite these uncertainties in our environment, our 2011 results demonstrated that we are building a high-performing portfolio that aligns well with our customers' priority investment areas. Our leading capabilities in these areas will be essential to securing our national interest for the smaller, more agile force structure and reduced defense budgets. We have a diversified government customer base that includes substantial exposure to the Air Force, the Navy and restricted customers, and we provided a slide that depicts our estimated 2012 revenue by customer. In conclusion, creating shareholder value in this environment means that we must continue to be absolutely focused on our key priorities, driving performance, effectively deploying our cash and optimizing our portfolio for the future. Our record these past few years demonstrates this view successfully, and I'm delighted to be working with our company's talented team to create long-term sustained value. So now, I'll turn the call over to Jim for a more detailed discussion of results and guidance. Jim?
James F. Palmer: Thanks, Wes, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. My comments will focus on our 2011 results and then 2012 guidance. But first, I'd like to reiterate Wes' comments relating to 2011 results, which, in my view, were outstanding. We again challenged our team to significantly step up performance, and they did, delivering higher earnings and converting those earnings into strong cash flow, all done in a challenging environment. Turning to the Sectors on Slide 5, Aerospace Systems had a strong finish to the year with solid sales and higher operating income. AS margin rate expanded 60 basis points to 12.1% from 11.5% in the prior year through a combination of improved performance on several programs and lower purchased intangible amortization. Now we are also doing some additional portfolio realignment in Aerospace, and as of January 1 of 2012, the Missile business, principally the ICBM program, will transfer from Aerospace Systems to Technical Services. Schedule 6 of the earnings release provides a reconciliation of historical results and results adjusted for that transfer. So with that adjustment, AS has 2011 sales of about $10 billion. And based on what we know today regarding our programs, we would expect Aerospace 2012 revenues to range between $9.7 billion and $10 billion, with low to mid 11% margin rates. Estimated 2012 sales reflect higher volume for programs like Fire Scout and E-2D Advanced Hawkeye, which are being offset by the DWSS termination, lower F-18 volume during the multiyear 3 start up and declining volume across the number of other programs. Electronic Systems 2011 sales declined 3%. Force reductions and overseas contingency operations reduced volume for programs like LAIRCM and the Vehicular Intercommunication Systems, or VIS. We also had lower domestic postal automation sales as we began to deemphasize that business in '11, in 2011. Operating income in 2011 increased 5% and margin rate expanded 110 basis points to 14.5%. The 2011 trends reflect improved program performance and positive adjustments for several programs in our Land & Self Protection business and our ISR business. 2011 was particularly strong due to positive performance adjustments on mature programs and programs nearing completion. For 2012, we expect modest decline in ES revenues to a range of $6.9 billion to $7.2 billion, reflecting the deemphasis of the domestic postal automation business and continued troop drawdowns that will impact programs like VIS, the Lightweight Laser Designator Rangefinder and some of our C4ISR networking for the Army. We expect ES to continue its strong performance with margin rates in the mid to high 13% range, exceeding our long-term guidance target of 13%. Information Systems 2011 sales reflect lower volume in our -- in civil agencies and our Defense businesses, including reduced funding for existing programs and program completion. As our shortest cycle business, IS has most been impacted by our customers' cautious spending in this uncertain budget environment. Operating income, on the other hand, improved by about 1%, and IS margin rate expanded 70 basis points, to 9.7% for the year. The higher margin rate reflects improved performance in civil programs, including the impact of the County of San Diego contract sale, both of which more than offset the impact of lower sales. For 2012, we expect IS sales of $7.4 billion to $7.6 billion due to lower volume for in-theater programs like the Command Post Platform and FBCB 2 I Kits, lower civil revenues resulting from the 2011 sale of the San Diego contract, which contributed $50 million of revenue in 2011 and then just the overall budget uncertainty. Due to their improving business mix, however, we expect IS will sustain much of the margin rate improvement that we saw in 2011, so we are forecasting a mid-9% margin rate for IS in 2012. Moving to Technical Services, 2011 sales declined 16% but operating income increased by 5%. Margin rate expanded 160 basis points to 8%. These results reflect the impact of the reduction in the participation in the Nevada Test Site program as well as portfolio-shaping actions to reduce our exposure to base operations programs. For 2012, we expect sales of $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion, which reflects our continued portfolio-shaping actions, the addition of the Missile Systems business at volumes that are about $100 million less than what we saw in 2011 due to the wind down of a major hardware upgrade program in the Missile business, as well as lower KC-10 volume and lower volume for several other programs. We expect Technical Services 2000 [2012] rate will be in the mid-8% range, reflecting the improving business mix, the transfer of the Missile business from AS and just overall performance. Now our 2012 margin rate expectations for all 4 of our business exceed our long-term target rates for each of the 4 businesses, which, as you know, are 11% for Aerospace, 13% for Electronic Systems, 9% for Information Systems and 8% for Technical Services. Moving to Slide 6, a summary of our 2012 guidance, Wes discussed the impacts of 2012 sales and how we establish our guidance. So I'm going to move on to the balance of the chart. On a consolidated basis, we expect the sectors to generate a segment margin rate of about 11% and we expect a total operating margin rate in the mid- to high 10% range, which reflects a positive net FAS/CAS pension adjustment of approximately $130 million and corporate unallocated expenses comparable to 2011.  Earnings from continuing operations are expected to range between $6.40 and $6.70 per share. We expect cash from operations of $2.3 billion to $2.6 billion, and free cash flow of $1.8 million to $2.1 billion. And again, we expect that cash flow will be weighted towards the second half of the year as has been our historical pattern. I would note that we are currently not planning any discretionary pension contribution in 2012, and that our required 2012 pension contributions are about $65 million. I should point out that in the fourth quarter of 2011, we made an additional $500 million discretionary pension contribution, bringing our total 2011 discretionary contributions to $1 billion. Slide 7 provides a bridge or walk between 2011 earnings per share and our 2012 guidance. Lower sales had an impact that ranges between $0.30 and $0.45 and lower segment margin rate accounted for another 35% -- to $0.30 to $0.35 of the variance. Our net FAS/CAS pension adjustment for 2012 is declining from a positive adjustment of $400 million in 2011 to a positive adjustment of $130 million, which impacts 2012 earnings per share by about $0.65. 2012 net FAS/CAS adjustment is based on our plan asset returns of about 6.5% in 2011, a 75 basis point reduction in the discount rate to 5% from 5.75% last year, and a 25 basis point reduction in our expected long-term rate of return to 8.25% from the 8.5% that we previously had used. The net pension adjustment also reflects a planned design change that reduces both FAS and CAS cost in 2012. That design change takes out significant future cost, thereby improving our competitiveness and affordability. This is an example of how we are adjusting our cost structure in response to our customer's need for affordability. I would also point out that even with the 75 basis point reduction in the discount rate, the funded status of all of our plans at year end was 88% on a GAAP basis.  2012 earnings per share assumes a tax rate of 34.25% about a $0.15 impact due to the expiration of the research and development tax credit. And lastly, our guidance includes continued capital deployment activities that result in a decrease in the weighted average shares outstanding of about 9%. This reflects our lower share count at the beginning of the year due to the substantial 2011 share repurchases, the issuance of shares in 2012 for incentive compensation and stock option exercises and anticipated 2012 share repurchases. The lower share count positively impacts 2012 earnings per share, ranging from $0.60 to $0.65. In summary, we continue to expect solid performance from our businesses in 2012, with margin rates that exceed our long-term targets and continued strong cash flow. So Steve, with that introduction, I think we're ready for some Q&A.
Stephen C. Movius: Thanks, Jim. Erin, we are ready to start the Q&A process.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Doug Harned from Sanford Bernstein.
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: I'm interested in Information Systems, and in the quarter, your backlog was down about 18%. And could you talk about where you're seeing the decline in the backlog across Defense Systems, Intelligence Systems and Civil? And where you think that's going to go longer-term? And I ask that specifically because with the strong position in Cyber and some other priority areas, one might expect some strength there. But can you talk about the subsegment trends?
James F. Palmer: Doug, the reduction that you're seeing in Information Systems backlog is principally due to the adjustment we made across the portfolio, but largely concentrated in Information Systems around our future expectation for amounts remaining on contract to be converted into future sales. And so, we went through a process this year that looked at amounts that were put under contract, for which the period of performance had largely expired and there'd been very little activity. So on one hand, there was amounts remaining on backlog, but it just felt like, to us, that in the current environment they may not be converted in the future sales. And so we made a -- an adjustment, or a reserve, against some of that backlog to reflect our view that some of that may not be realized as future sales. So that's the largest adjustment.
Wesley G. Bush: Let me give you a little bit of flavor, Doug, too, by some of the business areas. If you just look at our progress over last year, in terms of awards in the business, we're doing quite well. And the 3 components that you mentioned, Civil, Defense and Intel, civil's about 20% of the top line, defense is about 50% and Intel is about 30%, just very rough numbers for the makeup of the business. And as you might imagine, we are seeing some pressure on the Defense side in particular, and Jim mentioned that in his commentary with some of the changes relative to the needs in theater, the defense area is where the majority of that work has been performed for in-theater support. But when we strip that piece of it away, your earlier comment about our position on Cyber, which plays through actually all 3 of those areas, puts us in a place where we think that this business is quite well-positioned for the future. So we're not overly wringing our hands around either the component makeup of the business or how we're doing in the business calendar. But Jim's point was a very important one, about if you just look at that total backlog number, it reflects a very specific set of decisions we made this year in terms of our convention for reporting the backlog.
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: And that decision -- but that decision is essentially made to reflect some of the trends that are -- that I would say are weaker going forward, I assume.
Wesley G. Bush: I know this was largely a thought process. There's a lot of different conventions for reporting backlog that we see in our industry. There are those who report their future expectations towards the awarded on task orders for ID/IQs for which they've qualified. We don't do that. There is -- there are sort of a standard convention for one's you've captured an award, it goes into backlog and stays there unless terminated or other action is taken. We've gone through, I think a really rigorous process of going through a scrub, that Jim mentioned that we think is appropriate given the environment, but most of that cleanup was not necessarily a reflection of just this past year's decision.
James F. Palmer: Or even 2010.
Wesley G. Bush: That's right. It's more of a look long-term look back on the clean up that we felt was appropriate in light of all of the pressures that we see our customers facing. So it would be inappropriate to read that as an indicator of the success of the business in either capturing awards or at least over the last couple of years, and fulfilling those awards.
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Well then, is there a point here from what you described about declines in certain areas such as those related to current overseas operations? You see declines in certain areas, you see growth in others. Is there a point where you're really seeing the transition where you expect this will turn around in terms of a top line trend?
Wesley G. Bush: It's hard to call that over the longer term. We're guiding for this year. I think we're going to learn a lot by looking at the details of the President's budget that's due out here over the next couple of weeks, the details of the '13 budget, to see how that all parses out into the pieces. But I wouldn't want to be in a spot of trying to call it in terms of where that begins to turn around. Obviously, a big factor in that will be the transition of the overseas deployments. And how that actually plays out, I would say there's still some uncertainty surrounding that.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel from Jefferies.
Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: I want to sort of ask one -- make one comment and then ask a question that's probably totally fair, Wes. The comment first is I like the presentation that Jim does with respect to pension contributions after cash -- after taxes, rather. Most people don't do that, so I think that's a very good and fair and balanced true-up approach, and I appreciate that.
Wesley G. Bush: That's good.
Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: The other question, or the question is, we measure kind of performance on earnings per share, and you're going to have down results for this upcoming year. And while I recognize, if we look at the free cash flow yield for this upcoming year, it's, call it, 13%, give or take a little bit. So on one measure, great number going forward. On another measure, it's not really value-creating. How do you square that, Wes, and how do you think a little bit longer term on this challenge of growing earnings?
Wesley G. Bush: Yes, clearly there's a couple of components to it, and I think it's a very fair question, Howard. The pressures on the top line are the reality. That's the budget environment that we're in. It is imperative on us to make sure that our portfolio is very well-aligned as best we possibly can. And part of the reason for that extra chart that we included in the presentation today, the little pie chart, was to help you, help everyone, make their own assessment of how well they think that is aligned. We think it's a good alignment, but we wanted to provide a little bit more detail in the way we see our portfolio. And everyone can certainly make their own assessment of that. So focusing on the alignment to really manage our way through the budget pressures is very important. But the other really big lever, I would point out, too, there are very big levers in this process, are how well we're actually executing on the business. And we look at that, I think most perceptively in terms of margin rate and cash conversion. The margin rates are going very well. We've made a lot of progress in our company these last several years, and delivering more effectively on the opportunity that's inherent in the contracts. That goes to risk management, that goes just good old downright program execution and it also goes to cost management. And those are all areas that we've taken on very aggressively, and we are seeing the benefits translate into EPS. And then I mentioned, of course, free cash flow, converting earnings into cash. If you can't do that, then it's sort of empty to start with. And then, on the backside of that, what you actually do with a cash. So when we think about value creation, and because I think that was inherently the essence of your question, from my perspective, it means getting the best alignment with where things are going so that we can manage our way through the budget pressures, it means executing very, very effectively so that we're generating good earnings, and we're converting those earnings into good cash, and that means being very smart about what we're doing with that cash. That's the way we're thinking about the value equation in our company.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Cai Von Rumohr.
Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: So a question about pensions, so you have contributions of $65 million required, and yet kind of by what you said, it looks like you're underfunded by about $2.8 billion, and the government's writing you checks for $500 million. So essentially, pension is the cash flow plus on a pretax basis of over $400 million. So is that sustainable cash flow? I mean, if we look to the future, are you going to have to put more money in either this year in the future, or is the CAS going to come down so that your free cash flow that you're talking about this year in a steady-state environment is going to erode?
James F. Palmer: Actually, Cai, good questions. Frankly, my view would be over the foreseeable future, CAS costs are actually going to go up, largely because CAS amortizes what we all remember as the significant negative investment performance in 2008 over 15 years. So we're just beginning to -- on the front end of that amortization process, CAS costs likely are going up. You have the benefit of CAS harmonization that it will be stepped in over the next 5 years as well. So on a look-forward basis, I think we all would see CAS costs large largely going up now, to the extent that we have really great investment performance over the next couple of years. Again, that would be amortized over that 15-year period on a go-forward basis. So those are all offsets. I do think that, as I said, CAS costs go up over the next few years, looking forward. You are correct that if we don't make any voluntary contributions this year, we do have a cash flow benefit that comes from essentially recognizing the past actions we've taken to fund the plant -- plan ourselves, ahead of when we got reimbursed for the CAS cost.
Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: And then does that mean in the future, your -- if CAS is going up, your cash contributions also will have to go up, or how will that work?
James F. Palmer: That -- so as I think many of you know, we have 3 sets of different rules that we have to deal with. And essentially, cash contributions are governed by the ERISA rules and PTA funding. And they -- the cash contributions required there are a function of how well-funded you are. And again, at our 88% funding on a GAAP basis on an ERISA-funded basis we're close to 100%. In fact, you really have to look at every plan itself, but when we do that, our ERISA funding for purposes of cash contributions, the lowest funded plan is probably in the 95% range and some of them are well over 100%. But on an aggregate basis, just about 100% funded. So, and again, that ERISA funding is a function of how well-funded you are under that ERISA determination with a big factor being interest rates and they use a different set of interest rates that we need to use for FAS purposes or for CAS purposes. So I know that's a long-winded answer, but different set of rules, but it is affected by how well-funded your plans are to begin with. So we have a huge step up in that regard, and then interest rates pay -- play a factor as well.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol from JPMorgan.
Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Jim, on the segment margins, you indicated that in each of the segments, they're expected to run this year at slightly above your projected long-term average. And I was wondering if you could maybe characterize at a high-level why you think you're going to be able to sustain that this year. It is down about 60 basis points off of a great performance in 2011, but maybe something around mix, is the mix more favorable? And also, I would imagine that you are probably spending some money below -- in there somewhere around restructuring, given the sales declines. And that's probably negatively impacting you. So some color there would be helpful.
James F. Palmer: Yes, well, we are -- it's true, Joe, that we're spending some money on restructuring. We try to manage our overall overhead rates to accommodate that. But it's also very important to get out in front of those activities so that you don't have a negative impact on your programs. And so there's a delicate balance there. It is costing us some in terms of the efforts that we need to undertake to restructure. And in -- on terms of just margin rates overall, we do have some programs transitioning from one to another. I'll point to F-18 multiyear 2 to multiyear 3. So, a mature program, mature finishing production, to although a mature product on the front end of the new development or new production of the multiyear 3 contract. So we have instances like that across the board. And as I pointed out in my prepared comments, the Electronic Systems guys had just a fabulous year in 2011. Margin rates well above what I view as the target for that industry. I do expect that they're going to maintain some of that momentum, but I don't think they can maintain all of that momentum that we saw in 2011. So that's why you see their margin rates essentially declining from, let's call it around 14.5% in 2011 to the mid-13s that we guided to for our mid to high 13s that we guided to for 2012.
Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And from a mix standpoint, just thinking through what one more level maybe, you're cutting it certainly differently. From a mix standpoint, would you characterize domestic versus international as consistent with the long-term trend and then also maybe fixed price versus cost plus or mature versus R&D-oriented?
James F. Palmer: I don't know, Joe, that there's a significant shift in the overall mix. Our fixed-price content of the aggregate portfolio on a year-over-year basis. So I think it is much more, as we're seeing, some decline in the revenue base. Programs that are nearing completion, that are mature, having reduced volume on a go-forward basis. And so that's reflected in some reduction in margin rates. Essentially you have to absorb more cost with a lower volume on the remaining programs.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Maybe to go back to Cai's question for a second, Jim, on pension and then we'll move over to the operations. On the funding side, ERISA, 100% today, but I think that's more of an ABO basis. As you look out, when did the required contribution start to more tie back to the 88% funded status? So is it '14, is it '15? And are those sizes kind of in the $300 million to $500 million range?
James F. Palmer: Yes, all of -- you're asking for this huge crystal ball that has perfect clarity. So let me give you a perfect clarity answer. Obviously, it's going to depend on investment earnings in '12 and '13. It's going to depend on interest rates in '12 and '13. But if I were able to hold all of everything constant and achieve my long-term investment rate of return, I would be looking at contributions, required contributions in the 2013 timeframe of around $300 million.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay, great, that's -- I think that clarifies it. And then on the operations, I think the NRO surprisingly publicly stated a couple of weeks ago they were going to award the follow-on imaging satellite sole source to Lockheed this year. I think you guys are payload for that. I'm curious, 2 things. One is, would that be a booking sizable in 2012 and second, would be a source of growth in '13 or beyond?
Wesley G. Bush: Myles, I think we will refer you to the NRO to get the best response to that question.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn from Credit Suisse.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Doug touched on the backlog decline in IS, and you went through that in detail. But from a higher level, could you talk about the 12% decline year on year in total backlog and the unfunded piece of that is fairly significant. And you're -- and now your total backlog, both funded and unfunded as a ratio of sales has come down quite significantly over the last few years. So is this timing-related or do we have a -- is there a bookings issue coming?
James F. Palmer: I don't think so, Rob. So let me try to review again what went on in backlog. First, as Wes said in his comments, $25.3 billion of awards this year, roughly equal to sales. Let's start there. So we did have some backlog adjustments. We had this reserve that I talked about that aggregated about $3 billion across the portfolio, but largely in IS. In addition to that, we did have a restructuring of the NPOESS contract and another a couple of other space contracts where we took $1.5 billion of backlog out of backlog at the beginning of the year to reflect the cancellation of the NPOESS contract and then some change in some space programs. If you want, you can go back and look, and as I recall in the second quarter when we disclosed that. And then in the first quarter last year, with the decision to reduce our participation in the Nevada Test Site joint venture, we took the backlog that was -- because we're no longer consolidating sales, we no longer consolidate the backlog, and we took $1.7 billion out of the backlog to reflect that. Those are the 3 principal unusual activities, if you want to call it that, that occurred in backlog during the year.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Is there a way for you, Jim, to quantify the duration of the backlog today versus what it used to be?
James F. Palmer: The best way that I would do it is to take each of the amounts for the 4 sectors and divide by revenues, and that is kind of a rough approximation. Obviously, the IS, the shorter cycle business, has a lower backlog to sales ratio than any of the other segments of the business.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: And then just one other thing, we've heard from some of your peers on foreign military sales orders being pulled forward into the fourth quarter here and out of Q1. Anything there for you in that sense?
James F. Palmer: I think the foreign market is an opportunity for us on a go-forward basis. I think the Secretary's comments are encouraging. Obviously, we have to work through export control issues. But there is a demand or interest in a number of our products across the portfolio. And just logically, as U.S. defense budgets are constrained, it would seem that we would want to rely on our allies to do what we may have done in the past. So I think that is ultimately an opportunity for us in a go-forward basis.
Wesley G. Bush: All right, Rob, you were asking about some pull forwards out of potentially this quarter into the last quarter of last year. Is that --
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Only because we've seen it elsewhere.
Wesley G. Bush: I -- we didn't -- we did not see anything unusual in that regard in our company.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay, and then just lastly, Jim, I might've missed this because I joined the call late, but in terms of your buyback for '12 which was like about 8%, something like that, rough number, what's the cadence on that? How are you assuming that goes forward?
James F. Palmer: Generally spread throughout the year, consistent with largely our historical practice. So I wouldn't say it's exactly ratable through the year but spread throughout the year.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Jim, can I go back to pension one more time, and can you talk a little bit about what that design change means?
James F. Palmer: Yes.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Did you change the benefits? What did that mean?
James F. Palmer: We essentially put a cap on what is called final average earnings, for the people who participated or partly participates in the defined benefit plan so that after a point in time, final average earnings will not continue to grow, which essentially reduces the liability on a long-term basis, reduces cost starting in 2012 and going forward. Rather, it was important that we do that. We got a significant cost benefit out of it and essentially got our plans into what we thought was current market conditions.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Does that mean there's a liability is peaking now as well?
James F. Palmer: The liability is dramatically affected as we saw by the change in discount rates. So if you tell me what discount rates are going to be, then I guess I can tell you whether it's peaked or not.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay, all right, that's fair. And then separately, can you just talk a little about Global Hawk, Wes? You mentioned about the Block 30 termination. Can you just talk about how the Block 30 to 40 transitions? And obviously, I'm not expecting you to give me total Global Hawk sales, but can you just talk about directionally in percentages, how it looked from '10 to '11, then '11 to '12 as we're seeing some of those pieces?
Wesley G. Bush: Well, let me just say in terms of this transition, that's something that we're -- we are beginning the discussions with our customer community around. There's an important set of transitions from the production work we're doing on Block 30, certainly with Block 40, but also in the BAMS. And it would not be appropriate for me to get out in front of those discussions that we're having with our customer in that regard. I would say, naturally, that we were, as I said in my comments earlier, we were disappointed with the plan on Block 30, but we were also at the same time, very, very pleased with the very strong statement of support that we got from the Department on BAMS, and of course Block 40 and a number of our other unmanned missions, including Fire Scout. So I don't want to get out ahead of exactly how this will play out. We want to obviously work with the Department to make this work the right way. With respect to the numbers, I would just simply say that we spent some time thinking about the range of outcomes and that's included in the range of the guidance that we provided.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of David Strauss from UBS.
David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Jim, at Aerospace Systems, a lot of moving pieces there in terms of F-35 and the transition of the Missiles business. Can you just walk through all the different moving pieces and roughly how much they each account for? And then on F-35, just an update in terms of exactly where you stand, what's under contract at this point and what LRIP you're delivering on at this point?
James F. Palmer: So, let me grab a couple of things here, David. We had 10.1, 10.4 for revenues this year. The Missile business takes us down, the transition of that business takes us down to about 10, as I've said in my comments. And then as we look at some of the other parts of the business that are moving around, we saw some growth in Fire Scout and E-2D. The DWSS contract termination reduces revenues by about $200 million. And the lower volume on F-18 is probably about another $150 million or so. So all of those and then consideration, as Wes said, to what may happen or when something may happen on Global Hawk Block 30 allowed us to get to our thoughts around $9.7 billion to $10 billion of sales guidance for 2012. But those are the big pieces that moved from year to year.
David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: And on F-35 units of delivery, how much is that impact?
James F. Palmer: It's about $100 million.
David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: And as a follow-up, on the share repurchase, the 8% assumption, or the 8% down in terms of the assumption on share count, it doesn't look like, based on where you are at the end of the fourth quarter. It doesn't look like you're actually assuming that much more additional in terms of share repurchase for 2012.
James F. Palmer: Well, actually, I said 9%. I guess someone else had said 8%. And as I said in my prepared comments, you start at the beginning share counts. We're going to issue some shares here through stock incentive plans at the end of February. We anticipate, as been the historical practice, that we'll have stock options that are exercised during the year, and then we're going to spend some money during the year as well to buy back shares. You got to remember that the share count is based on a weighted average share count. So you spend a dollar in January, it counts as, let's say if you bought it -- spend $1 that was 1 share. That counts as 1 share. If you spend that dollar in December, it counts as $1.12 for this weighted average share count. So the timing of when you spend the money when you buy shares back is really important to its overall impact on the weighted average shares outstanding for the year. And as I said to an earlier comment, my assumption is that we spend the dollars not exactly ratable but generally spread throughout the year. So those are the moving parts that get us to an -- about an overall 9% decline in weighted average shares.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard from Royal Bank of Canada.
Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Jim, I was wondering, first of all, if you could give us a number for what your OCO, or operations exposure, was in 2011, and where you see that trending in '12.
James F. Palmer: We had, hard to quantify, but as we go and look at -- try to find all the pieces, we think it's about 3% of sales.
Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: And where is that heading in '12? Because you mentioned that there's a headwind in a couple of areas.
James F. Palmer: Well, we see a couple of hundred million dollars down.
Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay, and then secondly, there's a lot of goodwill on the balance sheet. I was wondering if you've done a year end sort of impairment review on that valuation and how close some of the goodwill items were to a write-down.
James F. Palmer: Obviously, we have to do that every year. It's part of the normal procedures. We have, let's call it, a little bit over $12 billion. And if you look at the financials, the largest part of that goodwill is in the Information Services business. And so we do take a good hard look at all of our assumptions around that. We're comfortable that there's not an impairment as of the end of the year. We'll have to watch what happens in terms of the future revenues and all of that associated with the overall budget, what it means to each of the businesses. But as I said, with the Information Services having the largest piece of the goodwill, if there's any area that might have any exposure, it would likely be in that area. All right?
Stephen C. Movius: Erin, I think we have enough time for one more.
Operator: And your last question comes from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi.
Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Just wanted to ask the capital deployment question and get some updated thoughts from you there. Obviously, you've got a pretty balanced approach up to this point between dividends and share repurchases. I'm just curious what you think going forward clearly on the acquisition front. I don't mean to necessarily get into the details about where you want to make acquisitions, but just the importance of acquisitions going forward.
Wesley G. Bush: Now, Jason, in terms of -- broadly on thinking about acquisitions, for us it always comes down to the value creation equation. I said a number of times and I continue to say it, we really like our portfolio. and I don't feel like we have large gaping holes that we got to rush out and deal with. So it allows us to be very thoughtful, very disciplined in how we think about acquisitions. At the same time, we do engage in looking at a wide angle of alternatives we think we have an obligation, certainly to our shareholders, for the long-term to be active in our thought process and active portfolio managers. Yes, but ultimately, it comes down to value creation. And I will tell you that of late as we've looked at what's going on in the M&A space, there are some transactions out there that would be hard for us to solve the equation on value creation if we were looking at it ourselves. So we have biased our cash deployment towards the areas that we talked about, the share repurchase and dividend. And I think that's been serving us quite well. But we're going to continue to look, and the market obviously will have some ebbs and flows and we will be effective assessors of what those opportunities will be.
Stephen C. Movius: Thank you very much. Now that concludes our call. Wes has a couple of follow-up comments to close, and then I'm obviously available for additional questions.
Wesley G. Bush: Now let me just wrap up with a few thoughts. I think it's helpful, given the dynamics of the environment we're in, to stress some fundamentals. When I think about our company, and I mentioned this during my remarks and in response to a couple of questions. I think there are 3 things that are really critical. First, in a time of increasing pressure in our top line, it's even more important that our businesses are delivering on profitability in cash conversion across all of our operations, and I think we've demonstrated some nice improvements over the last few years. It shows that this focus is paying off for us. And secondly, the large amount of capital that's returning, that we are returning to our shareholders demonstrates our focus on delivering shareholder value. And that is the way that we are thinking about the overall value equation in our company. And thirdly, as we've talked about, a fair amount of portfolio shaping is going to continue to be key in this emerging environment, making sure that we're well aligned for the future. When I think about it a little bit more broadly and look at the world around us right now, it's clear that our nation's military strategy is going to continue to depend both on the extraordinary capability of our servicemen and women, as well as our ability to ensure absolute technological superiority. And the strategy recognizes that we will have to address a range of threats to our nation's security. We think we're well-positioned to deliver that technological superiority to support our nation and our allies. We expect a lot of turmoil in the budget environment in front of us, especially over the course of this year. But I think it's going to be really important as we go through that to keep these fundamentals in focus.  Thanks again for joining us today, and thanks for your continued interest in our company.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Good day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. My name is Anne, and I will be your coordinator for today's call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the presentation over to Mr. Steve Movius, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.
Stephen C. Movius: Thank you, Anne and welcome to Northrop Grumman's Third Quarter 2011 Conference Call. We provide a supplemental information in the form of a PowerPoint presentation that you can access at www.northropgrumman.com.  Before we start, please understand that matters discussed on today's call constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to safe harbor provision of federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which are detailed in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risk factors may cause actual company results to differ materially. During today's call, we'll discuss third quarter 2011 results, our 2011 guidance for continuing operations and 2012 pension trends. On the call today are our CEO, Wes Bush; and our CFO, Jim Palmer. Please go to Slide 3.  At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Wes.
Wesley G. Bush: Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us. Overall, we're very pleased with our third quarter results. We continue to demonstrate that we can generate shareholder value and EPS growth in a challenging environment, by focusing on portfolio alignment, performance and effective cash deployment.  Our strong operational performance, combined with our ongoing share repurchases, generated a 23% increase in EPS from continuing operations. We're particularly pleased with results from the sectors. All 4 businesses generated strong operating income, higher margin rates and healthy-book-to-bill ratios. During the quarter, we repurchased 12.7 million shares, bringing total year-to-date repurchases to 28.4 million shares. At the end of the third quarter, $2.4 billion remained on our share repurchase authorization.  Third quarter free cash flow from continuing operations totaled $839 million. This year, through the end of the third quarter, we've returned approximately $2 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. New awards were also strong this quarter, totaling $7.8 billion, for a book-to-bill ratio of nearly 120%. As of September 30, total backlog was approximately $42 billion.  Based on the strength of this quarter's results, we are raising our guidance for EPS from continuing operations. We now expect 2011 EPS from continuing operations of $6.95 to $7.05, which at the midpoint of the range, represents year-over-year EPS growth of 20% before onetime items, such as last year's tax benefit and the impact of our 2010 debt tender.  As we've discussed before, we continue to make portfolio-shaping decisions and de-emphasize certain business lines. This includes decisions to exit non-core and underperforming businesses that don't provide attractive financial returns. Recent examples are the sale of the County of San Diego outsourcing contract and our decision to exit the domestic postal automation business. These portfolio-shaping actions have contributed to a year-over-year sales decline but have had a very positive impact on our company's performance.  Excluding portfolio-shaping actions, full 2011 sales would be 2% to 3% lower than last year due to the market environment. Our business continues to be impacted by budget uncertainty. Due to the 6-month continuing resolution process in fiscal year 2011, the potential for an extended continuing resolution, fiscal year 2012, and the possibility of further budget reductions, our customers continue to be cautious in releasing funds for their activities. While there is uncertainty regarding future budget levels, we believe there is clarity regarding the threat environment and our customers' need for affordability.  With the drawdown of In Theater operations over the next few years, we believe the nation will focus on developing affordable solutions to address broader, emerging and more capable threats. In that environment, we expect our relatively low exposure to the OCO budget, which is about 3% of our sales, will benefit us, as will our ongoing effort to cost competitively position our company. We continue to focus on positioning the company to perform in a more constrained environment. It's more important than ever that we continue to aggressively address our cost structure, our operational execution and, of course, our productivity. Over the long term, we believe C4ISR, unmanned, cyber and logistics will continue to be priority investment areas for our customers. This is where a substantial amount of our portfolio is focused and I thought it would be helpful to touch on each area before discussing the sector highlights.  So let me begin with our broad unmanned capability, which in addition to fixed wing and rotary vehicles, also spans sensors and processing. In total, unmanned currently represents about 10% of total sales and it is growing. Global Hawk continues to achieve important milestones and improved affordability. International interest in Global Hawk from our allies continues to grow, and we see this capability as an important part of future commerce with our allies. Our BAMS derivative of Global Hawk is also progressing well. And the X-47B, our unmanned demonstrator for the Navy, recently completed a successful demonstration of ship-based software and systems, that will play a key role in its ultimate operation from the deck of an aircraft carrier. We expect continued strong demand for C4ISR capabilities as the global threat profile continues to expand. Our nation and our allies are increasingly dependent on C4ISR to understand and address these threats, and our extensive sensor technology and our processing capabilities are well positioned to support information-gathering efforts.  In Cybersecurity, we're working with the defense and intelligence communities to address the rapid proliferation of threats. We're also successfully migrating tools and solutions developed for the .mil domain into the .gov domain and this represents a significant growth area for our Cyber work. And in logistics, we continue to address the need to maintain and modernize aging equipment, upon which our customers will depend as the number of new start programs diminishes.  So now, turning to the sectors. In addition to progress on unmanned programs, during the quarter, aerospace was awarded a $795 million contract to continue production of E-2D Advanced Hawkeyes, under LRIP Lot 3 and to procure long lead materials for Lot 4 aircraft. We were also awarded a contract modification for an additional Lot 2 aircraft.  In Electronic Systems, our data program has made tremendous progress in terms of the system design and development. G/ATOR is the first AESA-based multi-mission radar for the Marine Corp. It replaces 5 different legacy radar systems and it's a model for affordability, not only in acquisition cost, but in savings realized in training and sustainability of a single system. With several requirements for other new development ground-based radars being considered by the DoD, the rapidly maturing G/ATOR system provides a highly capable and affordable alternative. And in the third quarter, ES was awarded a contract to deliver advanced threat warning sensors as the latest upgrade to our Department of Navy, Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasure System, also known as LAIRCM.  In Information Systems, we recently won two key healthcare IT awards. IS received a centers for Medicare and Medicaid past quarter, to develop a system to identify high-risk claims in order to detect and prevent fraud waste and abuse. And we won the Department of Health and Human Services Encounter Data Processing Systems award. EDPS will track and aggregate Medicare data to support risk and pricing models. Both of these awards are aligned with our focus on the higher end, high engineering content part of the healthcare IT market. And our BACN system continues its mission-critical and theater performance. We've received follow-on awards to extend service, continue operations and maintenance and provide essential payload elements for interoperability testing. And the number of go-forward alternatives for additional variants are also being considered.  Technical Services received an award to modernize the unmanned hunter MQ-5B system to a digital configuration, and provide interoperability engineering services for our Army customer.  So in conclusion, it was a very strong quarter. Superior operating execution and effective cash deployment more than offset top line pressure. We continue to demonstrate that we can create value in an environment of constrained top line growth by focusing on our key priorities: Performance and execution that supports our customers' need for affordability, aligning our portfolio with priority areas of customer investment that provide attractive rates of return and effectively deploying our cash.  So now, I'll turn the call over to Jim for a more detailed discussion of results and our guidance. Jim?
James F. Palmer: Thanks, Wes and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Let me start by offering my perspective on our quarterly results, which I would characterize as a good, strong operating and cash flow result in a challenging environment that continues to put pressure on the top line.  The strong operating performance that I just referred to, together with improved net FAS/CAS pension adjustment, a lower effective tax rate and ongoing share repurchases, combine to generate a 23% increase in earnings per share from continuing operations. On a pension-adjusted basis, earnings per share from continuing operations increased 8%. Once again, operational improvements have offset lower sales, with segment operating margin increasing for both the quarter and year-to-date.  All of our businesses executed well. Operating margin rates expanded in all four sectors and all four sectors generated book-to-bill ratios greater than 1. Quarterly segment operating margin rate expanded 110 basis points to 11.8% and total operating margin rate expanded 230 basis points to 12.5%. I would also note that on a pension-adjusted basis, our operating margin rate expanded 80 basis points for both the quarter and on a year-to-date basis. As a result, pension-adjusted operating margin rate was 11% for the quarter and 10.9% year-to-date.  Given the focus most of you have had on the top line, I thought it was appropriate to spend a few minutes on some of the drivers of our year-over-year sales decline. There are three principal drivers causing the lower year-over-year sales. First, are the strategic decisions to de-emphasize non-core underperforming businesses that Wes referred to. Second is the transition to a units of delivery method on the F-35. And third are the external budget pressures. Much of the decline in the expected full year, year-over-year revenues is driven by our actions to de-emphasize or sell non-core and underperforming businesses. This includes the reduced participation in the Nevada National Security Site joint venture, which accounts for $580 million of reduced revenues on a year-over-year basis, as well as about $250 million that results from de-emphasizing several other businesses and contracts. These include the base operations, some base operation support and Technical Services, the sale of San Diego outsourcing contract and information services and our decision to exit the domestic postal automation business and electronic systems.  I want to reiterate what Wes said. It is important to recognize that these portfolio-shaping actions have contributed to the performance improvement we generated both in the third quarter and on a year-to-date basis. Secondly, with the anticipated move away from the cost-type contracting environment for the F-35 program, we are transitioning to a units of delivery revenue recognition model with LRIP 5, which will reduce 2011 revenues by about $225 million.  The third factor reducing sales is attributed to the customer spending challenges and budget pressures, as well as in theater drawdowns. The current CR and the impact on the current budget reduction discussions continue to constrain customer spending. Our prior guidance contemplated some improvement in the funding environment in the second half of year, which would have offset some of the portfolio shaping and F-35 impacts that I just discussed. But with the impact of the on-going deficit discussions and the current continuing resolution for fiscal 2012, I would now expect our fourth quarter revenues to be roughly comparable to this quarter.  So now, let me spend a few minutes and walk through the third quarter results for each of the sectors. In Aerospace Systems, third quarter sales declined 5% due to reduced funding for the weather satellite programs and the James Webb Space Telescope program, as well as lower volume on several other space programs. Lower revenue on the F-35 program reflects the revenue recognition transitioning to a units of delivery revenue method from a cost incurred method, beginning with LRIP 5. Rather than recognizing sales as costs are incurred, sales will now be recognized as units are delivered. This is essentially a timing difference, which reduced AS sales by about $50 million in the third quarter. The impact of this timing difference will increase over the next few quarters before it begins to reverse in the second half of 2012. Despite lower sales, AS third quarter operating income was comparable to last year. Operating margin rate expanded 60 basis points to 11.8%, due to improved program performance and somewhat lower amortization of purchase intangibles, which were partially offset by a negative performance adjustment on a space program. Based on year-to-date results, we now expect AS sales of $10.6 billion, with an operating margin rate in the mid-to-high 11% range. AS ended the quarter with a total backlog of $18.1 billion, which reflects new awards of $27.0 billion, the largest being the E-2D award that Wes mentioned. Book-to-bill for the quarter was about 105% in Aerospace.  Turning to Electronic Systems, where sales increased 2% due to higher volume for ISR targeting systems and naval marine systems. Operating income at ES increased more than 12% and operating margin rate expanded to 15.4%. Higher operating income and margin rate for the quarter resulted from performance improvements across various programs, including the achievement of a cost incentive for a space program and improved performance on an international radar program. These program performance improvements were partially offset by a $25 million loss provision for a dispute on the Flat Sequencing System Domestic Postal Automation Program, which as Wes mentioned, we are exiting. Based on year-to-date results, we expect ES sales of approximately $7.4 billion, with an operating margin rate in the low 14% range. ES total backlog at the end of the third quarter was $9.9 billion and reflects new awards at $2.3 billion during the quarter with a book-to-bill ratio of about 120%.  Information Systems had sales decline of about 8% for the quarter, primarily due to lower volume for defense and civil systems. Sales were also impacted by program completions and the sale of County of San Diego outsource contract, which had quarterly sales of $32 million in last year's third quarter. IS also continues to be impacted by the fiscal 2011 continuing resolutions and budget disruptions, which reduced funding for existing programs. As our shortest cycle business, budget reductions impact IS sooner than in some of the other areas. Despite lower sales, IS operating income for the quarter was relatively stable and operating margin rate expanded 70 basis points. The improvement is due to better performance in civil systems, including the benefit of the sale of the County of San Diego contract. Based on year-to-date results, I now see IS sales of about $8 billion, with an operating margin rate in the low 9% range. IS ended the quarter with a total backlog of $10.5 billion, reflecting new awards at $2.6 billion and a book-to-bill of just over 130%.  Moving to Technical Services, third quarter sales declined 22%, primarily due to the reduced participation in the Nevada National Security Site joint venture, which last year represented sales of $163 million. Operating income in Technical Services was comparable to last year and operating margin rate increased 170 basis points, principally due to the change in the joint venture participation. Based on year-to-date results, we expect TS sales of about $2.6 billion, with an operating margin rate of about 8% for the year. Technical Services ended the quarter with a total backlog at $3.5 billion, including new awards of $861 million and a book-to-bill ratio of about 125%. For the company, based on the strength of year-to-date results, we now expect a segment operating margin rate in the low 11% range and a total operating margin rate in the high 11% range. The increase in total operating margin rate, reflects the operational improvements we achieved to date and assumption of about $200 million for unallocated corporate expenses and some potential risk items.  Turning to cash, through nine months, cash provided by continuing operations before discretionary pension contributions is approximately $1.4 billion, and free cash flow before discretionary pension contributions is about $1 billion. So, based on our year-to-date results, we are on track for our cash guidance for the year. As Wes mentioned, we have increased our guidance for 2011 earnings per share from continuing operations to a range of $6.95 to $7.05 on a per-share basis. As Slide 4 indicates, our increased earnings per share guidance reflects an additional $0.10 to $0.15 for improved operating performance and $0.10 for lower diluted share count. I now see a reduction in weighted average shares outstanding for the year as slightly more than 6%.  I know many of you are focused on pension trends for 2012, so I wanted to provide an update in this area. Assuming our current discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on planned assets of 8.5%, as well as a host of other assumptions on mortality, wage increases, et cetera, 2012 net FAS/CAS pension adjustment would be comparable to this year's income of about approximately $400 million. Year-to-date through last Friday, estimated planned asset returns are slightly more than 5%. And as we have discussed last quarter, every 100 basis point difference from our 8.5% expected long-term rate of return represents approximately $35 million of FAS expense. And for the discount rate, every 25 basis points variance is about $65 million of FAS expense.  Obviously, we don't know exactly where interest rates will end the year but if I were setting the discount rate today, my cursory look would suggest a decrease in the range of 25 to maybe 50 basis points from our current rate of 5.75%. We continue to be very focused on managing the business for superior execution and strong cash generation while effectively deploying cash to create shareholder value. Included obviously, is investing in our business, distributing cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends and managing the balance sheet.  Again, I'd like to reiterate that year-to-date, we distributed approximately $2 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, and at the end of the quarter, we had $2.4 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization. On the balance sheet side, we will continue to monitor our pension plan investment performance and cash flow forecast to gauge whether or not we should make another discretionary pension contribution either or later this year or maybe even early next year.  So in conclusion, we are pleased with this quarter's results, especially the performance from our businesses, and we remain focused on generating value through portfolio optimization, performance and effective cash deployment.  Steve, with that overview, I think we're ready for some Q&A.
Stephen C. Movius: Thanks, Jim. In the interest of providing everyone an opportunity to ask a question, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one brief follow-on.  Now, Anne, we're ready to take our first question.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies.
Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Wes, you've been pretty good at anticipating a bunch of these changes and while you talk about some of your businesses having some growth opportunity, how would you characterize really the potential to show revenue growth over the next couple of years?
Wesley G. Bush: Well, it's certainly going to be a more challenging environment. And so let me give you a little bit of a flavor staring into 2012 as best we can. And again, we're not providing 2012 guidance on this call. So this is more in the category of flavoring. I would say beyond that, we're just going to have to continue to see how the budget environment shapes up as we go forward. But I would characterize it this way. Based on what we know today about 2012 budgets, the budgets appear to be heading towards, I would say, sort of a flat outcome relative to 2011. In terms of translating that into us, we would expect slightly reduced sales in a flattish environment due to the continuing impacts of some of the decisions that we've made. And these are proactive decisions we've taken on. One, the set of portfolio shaping actions that we've been talking about now for some time, as well as what Jim mentioned, the change in our approach to accounting on F-35 moving over the units for deliveries. So when we put those two things together, that represents in the range of $450 million to $500 million of downward pressure on our top line for next year. But I have to add, there can be additional changes in the budget environment, whether as a result of sequestration or other budget outcomes. And even though technically, those things are targeted to cause changes that would commence out in the 2013 timeframe. We know from observing our customer behaviors, over the course of this year that those changes would likely translate into customer actions in 2012. So even though I would characterize the 2012 budget environment as being, from what we can tell right now, rather flattish, it all depends on what happens over these coming months with a lot of the budget debate that's going on. I am encouraged just to balance that out a little bit, very encouraged by the strong statements that we're seeing from the national leadership, both Secretary of Defense and others in the administration, as well as a number of critical Congressional members who are calling for the preservation of a robust national security spending profile. So that's on the encouraging side of the equation. But realistically, we, like most others in our industry, are preparing for a range of outcomes to make sure that we stay competitive and that we're positioned to create value, irrespective of which way we see this go. There are meaningful opportunities out there. And as I went through the perspective on our portfolio, unmanned, cyber, C4ISR and logistics and all of those areas, we see priorities for customer investment. The question is going to be how much capacity do they have to apply towards those priorities.
Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: I see that and, I mean, you also seem to indicate that there is a number of international opportunities that are possible. Are any of these really close at hand or is this -- I mean as you sort of see it, I don't want to talk too much about 2012 either and get you there, but if you sort of look at it, you don't have a lot of holes to fill for '12. There's more a potential for opportunity. Is that the way to think about it?
Wesley G. Bush: There's always a balance between the negative budget pressures as well again some of the other opportunities. International is an interesting area. I've learned a long time ago never try and project the timing on international awards. There's so many variables involved there. But there are some very substantial international opportunities on the horizon. The unmanned -- interest in our unmanned capabilities just continues to grow. And it will take a little bit of time for all of the policy decisions to be sorted out and the exact decisions on who can buy what. But I see that as a very meaningful set of opportunities for us. And just more broadly, in the C4ISR profile, I also see some very meaningful opportunities for us around the globe in that arena as well. So yes, international will be an important part of our perspective as we think about managing our portfolio going forward. Projecting the timing is a little difficult.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Access 342.
George Shapiro - Citi: The question I had was this one general one and one follow-up. If the sales next year will be down a little bit, the book-to-bill all being well above 1 would imply that the duration of that what's being booked now is somewhat longer and that what would be the reconciliation of those two comments?
Wesley G. Bush: Well, we'll have to see how that actually plays out. What I indicated was some pressure on our top line for next year in terms of the ongoing effects of the portfolio decisions, as well as the accounting change on F-35. I want to be careful in not giving guidance for next year. We'll think about doing that as we have our call at the end of the fourth quarter. But your observation is a good one, George. Book-to-bill was strong this quarter. I think our backlog is holding up nicely and a lot of that is longer-term work. But it depends on which of the sectors in the company that we're talking about. AS is usually the longer-term cycle on awards, whereas IS and certainly TS are much shorter and ES is somewhere in the middle.
George Shapiro - Citi: And then just one for Jim. In the aerospace sector, you mentioned there's an unfavorable performance adjustment for a space program. If you could just quantify that a little bit, and then in electronics, you gave the number for the Flat Sequencing System but you also said there was some positive adjustments, so kind of what is the overall net-net effect in the electronics area?
James F. Palmer: In aerospace, the adjustment on the space program was about $18 million negative, an adjustment to change our booking assumption related to future on orbit fees. And then in electronics, yes, the $25 million adjustment for the dispute around the domestic postal program. But that was partially offset by positive adjustments, more than fully offset actually, by $17 million of the cost performance achievement on the SBR's program, as well as a $14 million international radar performance improvement. Net-net, ES had positive performance adjustments, including those 3 items, as well as some other smaller items as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein.
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: I'm interested in Information Systems and you've got a very good backlog there, now this quarter. Your margins have been strong. When you look out, this is an area, it's shorter cycle. I think there are a lot of concerns about the federal IT budget environment and there appear to be a lot of competitors trying to move after new starts. What are you seeing, when you look forward, both in terms of the competitive environment and in just the general margin and earnings trajectory that one might reasonably expect?
Wesley G. Bush: Doug, let me give you a little bit of a flavor on the environment. If we look at the top line trajectory in IS over the course of this year, it's pretty much in line with what we're seeing across the market. Interestingly, if you dive into it a little bit, we have 3 major components of IS. We have the Intel business, the defense business and the Civil business. Intel and Civil are essentially flat over the course of the year, taking into account, as Jim mentioned in his remarks, the sale of the County of San Diego contract. The decline that we've seen has been primarily in defense. And when you analyze what's happening there, it is essentially pretty much across the board, a very broad array of program activities, where we're seeing lower funding levels driven by the customer's behavior as they're dealing with the complexities of their budget environment and all of the challenges that those customers are dealing with. So I think it's important to understand where we're seeing the effect and how that effect is manifesting. This is a market where there are a lot of competitors. When IS goes to market, it goes to market often times against four or five competitors. So there's a lot of competition. It is a market with a lot of variation as well in terms of how the products and services are offered. We tend to position towards the higher engineering content side of that marketplace. And we've got some good competitors out there. But we continue to see it as an attractive market. There is a continuing need on the side of the government, both the DoD and the intelligence community and the civil community to modernize the systems when it comes to Cybersecurity, to better protect the systems. And overtime, to actually put the government in a position of saving money by having more modernized and efficient IT systems. So it's a meaningful market but certainly a lot of competition.
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Are you seeing margin pressure when you look forward with this higher level of competition?
Wesley G. Bush: We've given a view that I think we continue to see as the right view that a margin rate of around 9% in that business is sustainable. And I haven't seen anything that would cause us to change that outlook.
James F. Palmer: So, I guess I might -- I would add that if I look at our information services business, I characterize it in 2 broad categories, maybe 30%, 35%, 40%, that kind of range is services. The balance, let's call it 60%, is much more in software development integration, hardware integration, kind of product, if you will, product development. Clearly, I think we're seeing greater pressure on the services side, potentially. It's always been characterized by a significant number of competitors, and so that's the nature of the business, basically.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: First of all, just more of clarification, Jim, in reconciling the discount rate, 25 to 50 basis points would be where you've snapped the line today. And I guess I was just trying to reconcile that with 100 basis point drop and the AA corporate and kind of what some of the other industrial companies are looking for, more in the 75 to 100 basis point area. Any thoughts there?
James F. Palmer: Myles, our discount rate is developed based on AA bond portfolio, exactly matched to the maturities of our pension liabilities. And so when we have done that in the past, the kind of -- and using that model at today's point, that gives us roughly 25 to 50 basis points reduction in discount rate. And at this point, it's almost meaningless because as you know, we set the rate at the end of the year. But snapping the line as of September 30, we were looking at about a 25 to 50 basis points decline.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. Fair enough. The real question is on the F-35. Lockheed is talking about the expenditure before contracts, essentially on the Lot 5. And I know, for you guys, Lot 4, I think, price point, I'm not sure you've finalized that. Can you give us an update on where you are with both Lot 4 and Lot 5 in terms of desensitizing your pricing. And also if there's any readthrough implications for you building off of contractor or pre-producing before contract is offered?
James F. Palmer: Let me take the last piece first. On LRIP 5, we have, at this point, I characterize as a $50 million exposure, if the program were to be terminated for some reason at this point in time. So it's something that we're mindful of, thoughtful of. But I think that we'll continue to monitor this as we go through time but it's a really important program, as you know, for our customers and we just got to come through the negotiations around the contract at the prime level and then we'll get our negotiations, I think, then shortly after that completed as well. On LRIP 4, we continue to have conversations. I think we're pretty well close. We don't have a final deal as yet but continue to work towards the deal.
Wesley G. Bush: And then Myles, this is Wes. Let me add on LRIP 5. It is really important that this contract gets funded, in terms of keeping this pro-bail [ph] production process on track to enable industry and the broad supply chain that supports the industry to enable us to continue to work on affordability. So there is a direct connection between affordability and getting this thing funded. And I know that everyone is working hard on that. We're working to support the process as best we can. But that is a key factor to keep in mind relative to this program. Getting LRIP 5 funded is a critical next step.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Is there any type of -- I don't know once they drop-dead date, but I mean is it just [ph] that gets more painful the further on you go and there's no real drop-dead date though?
Wesley G. Bush: I think everyone has to think through where we all stand on this. And the position that I would say broadly industry is taking is we always work with our customer. Our customers are under great duress right now and we're working hard with our customer. But we're not in the business of financing these programs. So there comes a limit in everyone's capacity to deal with that. So it's something that I would say that there's strong alignment on across the industry and we're working as hard as we can to be supportive of the program but we recognize that we've got to get this thing funded.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Nadol with JPMorgan.
Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Nice margin performance again this quarter, and I wanted to dig into that a little bit from a high level, just looking at the segment margins. It seems that Jim, a couple of the revenue points that you pointed out in terms of revenue pressure also are probably helping lift your margins, and, of course, you have good performance as well I'm sure, but de-emphasizing the non-core businesses, those are certainly lower margin. And then the budget pressure, the new start revenue that is not coming in presumably would've been lower margin revenue. So is there a way to quantify maybe of the 90 bps improvement year-on-year for the quarter or the 110 year-to-date, how much of that is maybe due to those issues? And then really, what I'm looking at is going forward, if you think about your segment margins next year, do you think that these levels are sustainable or do you think that the mix might provide a little bit of pressure as it normalizes?
James F. Palmer: As Wes said, and I want to reiterate, we're not providing guidance for 2012 at this point. But at the same time, we have commented a number of times that our long-term margin rate objectives for each of the four segments, we believe, are representative of where those businesses ought to be performing over a long period of time. We feel comfortable about that even in today's environment. As far as trying to quantify how much of this year's margin performance improvement is mix or other factors, it's very, very difficult to do. Clearly, the organization had had an increased focus over the last couple of years, frankly, on strong execution. As you know, we've been very mindful of being prudent about the types of contracts we take, getting contract structured appropriately, structured to reflect risk inherent in the type of work that we're performing, and ultimately making sure that we have a management team that is strong and focused on delivering the product, as well as the margins that were negotiated in the contract. So I don't think I can really break it down into the elements that you're looking for.
Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: It's a tough question, I know. Just as a follow-up on your pension comments, Jim, in terms of the flat FAS/CAS, what is your assumption for each of the components, for FAS and for CAS? And I'm specifically trying to divine your year CAS expectations?
James F. Palmer: Actually, I don't have that number with me. But as I recall, the CAS cost accounting number doesn't move much on a year-over-year basis from '11 to '12. I'd have to get back to you on the actual numbers. But as I recall, there's not much improvement change in the cost accounting pension expense from '11 to '12.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays Capital.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I want to go back to one of your growth areas and you talked about on cyber, and General Clapper was commenting a week or two ago about the pressure that we may see on IC budgets and the intelligence community, participating in the budget cuts and deficit reduction, and I wanted to know, I mean this is a part of your business I know that's tough to talk about it, but as you think about that growth avenue, in the context of that sort of commentary, have your expectations there changed at all? What are you seeing there? How are you thinking about that? Is there information in there that we should take notice of?
Wesley G. Bush: The way characterize it just fairly broadly is kind of in 2 pieces. One Intel and then more broadly. On Intel, clearly every part of the federal government is going to have to participate in the efforts to work on the budget deficits. And I think Mr. Clapper's statements were reflective of that. That said, within each of the budget areas, there are going to be priorities and we continue to see cyber as a priority, a very high priority because of just the ever-growing recognition of the threat and the ever-growing magnitude of the threat. So within Intel, we continue to see Cyber as a priority. But the second perspective is the broader perspective, which is Cyber, for many years, had been something that had been largely focused in the Intel and defense communities as the primary concerns around what the threats might be capable of doing with respect to challenging the nation's capabilities. That is no longer the case. Clearly, Intel and defense continue to be very, very concerned and very focused on Cyber. But that concern has now expanded across the government and even beyond government. And as I think I mentioned in my opening remarks, as we see the concerns migrate from, if you will, the .mil domain into the .gov domain, the need for cyber security and cyber protection is continuing to expand. So we think this is an important part of our overall portfolio and we do see it as high on the priority list in just about any scenario going forward.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division: So if the IC budget needs to contract but cyber doesn't, what is it that has to lose? I mean it seems like a zero sum game to me?
Wesley G. Bush: Well, clearly, there will be other aspects of it and I really wouldn't want to go into the other elements of the Intelligence Community budget. But it will be a portfolio balancing process that the Intelligence Community has to go through to, just as the DoD is going through.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.
Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Just two follow ups in terms of risk issues. Have you completed your contract with Boeing on the F-18? And secondly, given that you took a loss on a postal contract in this quarter, are we going to have to see any more losses to get out of this business?
James F. Palmer: Let me take the last one first. Obviously, if we thought there were any more losses that we had to take, we would've booked them in the quarter. Obviously, every quarter address the situation. So it's -- something changes that will be reflected in that quarter's results, but kind of based on what we know, we got it. If the environment changes, we will address it. On the F-18 multiyear contract, we continue to have negotiations or conversations with Boeing around that contract. Again, we're making progress. But I would characterize it as signed, sealed and delivered at this point.
Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: And lastly, do you have any other contracts? You've mentioned F-35 and F-18, any other contracts where you are a subcontractor where you're kind of working without a finalized contract? I mean obviously not a $10 million job. But any other large ones of substance?
James F. Palmer: I don't think so. They key -- I think, what you're really trying to get at is where you don't have funding...
Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Right.
James F. Palmer: So, for example, just because we don't have a contract on F-18, we have funding and are being paid in accordance with normal practices for costs being incurred. So other than that, the comments around the F-35 Lot 5, I can't think of any substantial dollars or contracts that we really have at risk associated with the work that we've already performed.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rob Spingarn of Crédit Suisse.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Regarding the bookings, this goes back to George's question and, Wes, I think you did acknowledge that the -- very strong quarter here, of course. But the earlier quarters were a little lighter. What are you thinking for December? Was this driven by the year end for the federal budget?
Wesley G. Bush: We generally don't guide on awards and so I wouldn't want to get into the habit of doing that. Third quarter is often times a stronger awards quarter, particularly in IS, where we've got a little bit more of the short-term stuff. However, I would say, this year has not been a typical year by any stretch of the imagination with the effects of the continuing resolutions, both last year, the 2011 CR and the prospect of a longer CR here in 2012. So I wouldn't try and use my average year comparisons for this year because things have been quite a bit in flux. So we'll see how we do in the fourth quarter. We are working that aggressively, working it hard, of course, to make sure that our backlog continues to be a healthy position for the company. But when I look at how we're doing competitively, which is kind of how it comes out ultimately, I'm pleased with how we're doing competitively. I think we're doing quite a good job in capturing the work that we're going after, when I look at it in a broad sense across the company. And if we can continue to do that, I think we'll do just fine.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And then just on a cash return to shareholder basis, you've been very good about buying back stock and using your portfolio-shaping opportunities to do that and a long history there. Are you thinking at all about shifting the stock repurchase alignment against the dividend and perhaps favoring the dividend going forward? There seems to be a trend there.
James F. Palmer: Rob, we continued to, as I said with the $2.4 billion remaining authorization for share repurchases, we liked the balanced approach that we've had over the, frankly, since we started share repurchases in 2003. And I'd just point out that since 2003, through the end of the third quarter, cash return to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends is, from round numbers, 100% of free cash flow on an aggregate basis through that period of time. I don't see much change in continuing to emphasize both share repurchases and dividends. We obviously view dividends as very important, and as a long-term commitment to our shareholders. So we look at both the competitive payout ratios, as well as using other cash to be able to purchase the stock when prices are we find attractive.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: But would you see any value, perhaps, in having a higher dividend yield given what some of your peers have done in order to send that message on your long-term confidence?
James F. Palmer: You mentioned yield. I am not a yield-focused guy. I can get yield up by having a stock price decline. I am a payout-focused guy. We are, as a company, think about it in that term and we think that we have competitive payout ratios.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Heidi Wood with Morgan Stanley.
Heidi R. Wood - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Wes, I want to turn back to this F-35 issue and explore it just a little bit more. And I admit I'm a little confused by your comments about being encouraged by strong statements from leaders. Could we share a thought on record talking about being willing to break glass in the industry, and going through this Should-Cost review. Should we take this to mean that the Should-Cost review is going to be confined to the F-35 or I guess I'm just a little worried that this is a canary in the coal mine.
Wesley G. Bush: My commentary with respect to strong statements by leaders with respect to the robustness of national security spending and the view that the Secretary of Defense, and as I think I mentioned others in the administration, as well as some senior leaders on Capitol Hill, have been very public in expressing over these last number of weeks that it's imperative that even though we've got to all work hard in deficit reduction, we have to protect the national security. And I see that as very, very encouraging. With respect to the implementation of the variety of initiatives under way in the Pentagon, I do think this Should-Cost methodology is a broad methodology that is intended to be applied in a variety of different circumstances. I wouldn't know how to project what the full breadth of that application might be. But it's something that I do think we'll see an increasing amount. It remains to be seen what that translates into for contract outcomes. Obviously, the government, the department needs a set of methodologies to make its determination of value and cost and contracts. But there's always somebody else at the table in this industry. The industry also has to make its determination of what we're willing to do, how far we're willing to go, in terms of the risk side of the equation; and what reasonable profitability opportunity needs to be on those contracts. So it's not one-sided. It's two-sided. And we have to be able to work hard to get our way through this. So I would say there is probably a little bit more tension in the system right now, around how all this is going to work, what the real outcomes are going to be. But we're going to have to pop through it.
Heidi R. Wood - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: All right, and then a follow-up. You and I have had discussions about how you're shaping Northrop and keeping what you see ahead, you've been obviously divesting in a thoughtful and disciplined way. Should we expect to see, as we look ahead, a pickup in M&A activity?
Wesley G. Bush: It will always, for us, come down to value creation. And I will say in watching some of the recent M&A activity, it's been a little hard for me to figure out how with multiples getting paid, we actually generate a lot of value. And so when we're looking at really high multiple, transaction multiples out there, it's probably not the first place we go for value creation, but we do look. We are engaged. We have not closed down our M&A department. It's an important part of the long-term vitality of any organization to be engaged in bringing in capabilities. I've said a number of times and I still am on the same mind that I don't see any big gaping holes in our portfolio today. So there's not a strategic urgency that we're feeling around. We've got to go by this capability or we got to go by that capability. But we are thinking about it in a broad way, thinking about the future of the industry, and where the industry may shape out here in a different environment. And I think you should expect us to be thoughtful but disciplined as we get into this process.
Heidi R. Wood - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: All right, great. Then if not, then we'd see more focus on share repo and dividends as usual?
Wesley G. Bush: We've had a long track record of doing that.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Just on the use of cash, Jim you had mentioned thinking about a discretionary pension payment in the fourth quarter of this year into next year. Just how do you weigh that just because obviously with the pressures you're going to see from the FAS side going into next year, how do you weigh that relative to buybacks or dividends?
James F. Palmer: As I mentioned, I will look at both investment performance in the plan and then our cash flow expected results for the year, as well as into next year. As you know, our history in the pension plan has been to generate a nice returns in excess of our long-term rate of return of 8.5%. And so pension contributions, in which you get a tax deduction and then generate those kind of returns that we've had in a historical basis is a very, very good use of cash. Cash on cash returns on a historical basis in excess of 12%. So the balance of both wanting to make sure that our plan is very well-funded, returning cash to shareholders, as I mentioned. And so it's really a balancing activity around the effective use or deployment of our cash.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: And then just in general, it sounds like what you've been saying is that the areas that impacted you in the second quarter, in terms of a slow recovery from the end of the continuing resolution, that the customer behavior really has not changed over the course of the third quarter. Or has it actually gotten a little bit worse in terms of the time it takes for them to give you task orders, et cetera?
James F. Palmer: I would characterize it as an overall about the same. In some areas, it's a little bit better. In some areas, others, as I mentioned in my comments, we thought that there may have been some additional funding on certain programs that would've allowed us to offset some of the other declines that we had anticipated, for example, the F-35 change in revenue recognition model. So on an overall basis, I'd characterize it as about the same.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: One last question is for Wes or either of you, are there any key orders or bigger orders that we should be thinking about, like an LRIP 4, F-35 stands out when those come in? But is there anything else that we should be thinking about that's big over the next six months or so?
Wesley G. Bush: There's a whole variety of things that are out there. No one in particular is make or break. But I've mentioned a few of them already. Maybe just to give you a little bit of a flavor across some of the businesses. In AS, unmanned continues to be an important area for us, both domestically and increasingly international. The UAE, the airborne surveillance program, is an important in AS. And over the longer term, U-class is a program that we're certainly putting a lot of attention and focus on, but that's a little bit longer term. In ES, I would point out the CIRCM program, as the Army IRCM program that's outcoming. The Air Force is working on upgrades to F-16. I think that's going to be an important part of it and the Navy's pursuing new class of radar and the call it air and missile defense radar, AMDR. That's an important side of future opportunities there. In IS, CANES on the Navy side is coming in the not-too-distant future, I believe and I've already talked a lot about the cyber work and the different dimensions of that. Ground Combat Vehicle, where we're partnered with BAE systems, is another very important program. We'll see how that matures and what the timing of that might eventually turn out to be. And technical services has a whole variety of both sustainment and upgrade activities, that it is out competing in the not too distant future. The whole company is actively engaged in opportunities and pursuing them aggressively.
Stephen C. Movius: Anne, this is Steve. I think we have time for one more question.
Operator: Our last question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS.
David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Wes, you described your exposure to OCO at around 3%. Does that reflect the $200 million impact you've already seen this year or is that prior to that? And the 3% or so you do have left, how do you expect that to kind of come down here with obviously what's going on in Iraq and the drawdown in Afghanistan?
Wesley G. Bush: That is the overall 3% is kind of 2 different pieces. One piece of it has been BACN. BACN was an important component of the OCO business. And how BACN transitions overtime, does it find its way into the base budget or not, we'll have to see. It's been very, very successful in theater and there has been a growing view of its longer-term importance. So hard to tell how that piece of it goes. The other pieces of it are lots of different programs. We talked on the second quarter about VIS, it was an important part of it. There was a huge push over the course of last year on VIS to get it deployed in the theater on all kinds of different vehicles. So this year's sales have come down substantially on VIS. But the remainder of that is just a whole variety of programs that are providing individual pieces. LAIRCM has also benefited from some of the OCO funding. So it's a little bit hard to tell with the planning in Afghanistan exactly which pieces of it come out at what time. But again, it's a fairly distributed set of elements across our portfolio.
David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: As a follow-up, based on your guidance, you're calling for a lower Q4 in terms of earnings. I think this might partially have to do with higher corporate expense. Jim, maybe if you can just give some color around that and maybe talk longer-term, the outlook for corporate. It seems to keep coming in lower than what you're guiding to.
James F. Palmer: David, I know in the fourth quarter that we've taken some actions already in the fourth quarter, some headcount reduction actions. And so that will be somewhat of a drag in the fourth quarter. And there are a couple of things in the corporate and allocated world that at least have a potential to occur in the fourth quarter, so all of those have been considered or factored into our thinking around the fourth quarter results.
Stephen C. Movius: And that concludes our Q&A. Wes, any final comments?
Wesley G. Bush: Yes. I guess just to summarize. I would say our strong third quarter results demonstrate that our continuing focus on performance, portfolio optimization and cash deployment to benefit our shareholders is creating value for our company and positioning us well for what is going to be a more challenging environment. So thanks again, everyone, for joining us today and for your continuing interest in our company.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation and you may now disconnect. Have a good day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Northrop Grumman's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. My name is Crystal, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded for replay purposes.  I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Paul Gregory, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.
Paul Gregory: Great. Thank you very much, Crystal. Good morning, everyone and welcome to Northrop Grumman's Second Quarter of 2011 Conference Call. We provided supplemental information in the form of a PowerPoint presentation that you can access at www.northropgrumman.com.  Before we start, please understand that matters discussed on today's call constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which are detailed in today's press release and our SEC filings and include a new risk factor related to the resolution of the issues regarding the U.S. government's debt ceiling. These risk factors may cause actual company results to differ materially.  During today's call, we'll discuss second quarter 2011 results and our financial guidance for 2011 for continuing operations.  On the call today are our CEO, Wes Bush, and our CFO, Jim Palmer.  With that, let’s go to Slide 3. And at this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Wes.
Wesley Bush: All right. Thanks, Paul. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us.  Our second quarter results demonstrate that our strategy of driving shareholder value through performance, portfolio optimization and effective cash deployment continues to generate EPS growth. Despite a challenging top line environment, we had exceptional margin rate performance for the quarter. After adjusting last year's second quarter results for the $0.98 per share tax benefit, our earnings per share from continuing operations increased 24% to $1.81 from $1.46. The primary EPS growth drivers were continued performance improvement in our businesses, higher pension income and a lower share count.  Our businesses generated a 12% segment operating margin rate. Total operating margin rate increased to 12.8%, primarily reflecting performance improvements and higher pension income. In May, we executed a $1 billion accelerated share repurchase, which immediately reduced our outstanding share count by 15.6 million shares. And along with the dividend increase we also announced in May, demonstrates our continued commitment to creating shareholder value through returning cash to our shareholders.  We now expect our 2011 EPS from continuing operations to range between $6.75 and $6.90. The increase in 2011 EPS guidance contemplates our strong year-to-date results and performance improvement for both segment operating margin and total operating margin rates. The new range represents double-digit, year-over-year EPS growth after adjusting for one-time items in 2010 such as the tax benefit and the impact of our debt tender.  Cash performance for the quarter and year-to-date continues to support our guidance. Through 6 months, cash from continuing operations, before discretionary pension contributions, totaled $490 million, 21% higher than last year. And as we've stated on previous calls, we expect cash generation to be weighted toward the second half of the year which has been our historical pattern.  Turning to sales, 3 primary factors impacted the quarter. Budget uncertainties impacting our customers, the announced force reductions in Iraq and Afghanistan and our own portfolio shaping decisions that were anticipated in our guidance.  So let me briefly discuss all 3 of these.  First, overall budget pressures and the decline in government and defense outlays. The 6-month continuing resolution, as well as continued uncertainties surrounding the debt ceiling and future defense budgets, caused our customers to move more slowly and spend more conservatively. We did not see the recovery in spending that one might have expected with the end of the continuing resolution and the passage of the fiscal year 2011 budget. In this environment, new awards are moving to the right, and it's also taking a bit longer to get continuing business under contract.  In addition to budget pressures, we are beginning to see the impact of the announced troop drawdowns in Iraq and Afghanistan primarily in Electronic Systems for ID/IQ contracts, such as the vehicular intercommunication systems that are used by the Army.  And finally, sales do reflect our strategic portfolio shaping, which includes the previously announced reduction in our Nevada Test Site joint venture participation, which we announced earlier this year, as well as the sale of our San Diego County outsourcing contract back in May. While these 2 actions reduced second quarter sales by approximately $160 million, they also supported this quarter's performance improvement and segment margin rate expansion.  So based on year-to-date results and our outlook for the rest of the year, we now expect 2011 sales of approximately $27 billion. Looking forward, we continue to believe that we are well aligned with our customers investment priorities in Unmanned Systems, Cybersecurity, C4ISR and Logistics. We believe that these areas will continue to be well supported in future budgets as they are critical to the most pressing national security missions. We expect that once the current state of budget disarray is resolved and future projects are clarified, our customer spending behavior should begin to normalize. However, the environment continues to be very dynamic and it may take some time before there is more clarity in DoD strategy and its program level planning. So now turning to our operations, last Friday we were awarded a $795-million E2D contract that includes LRIP 3, a plus up on LRIP 2 and longleaf funding for LRIP 4. The contract also provides an option for LRIP 4 production, which we expect will be awarded sometime next year. This is a significant milestone for Northrop and for the Navy as it increases the number of aircraft purchased across multiple production lots. And it results in overall per aircraft cost reductions through economies of scale. Based on this contract, we expect to recover sales on this program in the second half of the year.  We also have several large pending awards, including F-35 and the latest multiyear for the F/A-18.  Now I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing some of our unmanned programs. Starting with Global Hawk, the program is making very good progress. We've used the Block 30 IOT NE results as a basis for incorporating a number of improvements. Of the 9 primary issues identified in that report, 5 have already been corrected and the program is on track to correct the remainder over the next several months.  The Department of Defense has recertified the program and deemed it critical to national defense. The DoD also recommended reducing the number of Block 30 attrition aircraft and using those savings to fund support areas such as sustainment, spares and ground station and communications, to enable the extensive operational use of these systems.  In addition, the Global Hawk affordability initiative that Northrop Grumman is driving with the Air Force is making progress in ensuring these systems continue to bring value to our customer. To quote some recent remarks by a senior Air Force official, "Global Hawks are getting the job done today for the war-fighter in the field and will continue to be a key contributor in our intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities," end quote. We believe the program is postured for success and should be ready for a full rate production decision.  Fire Scout, also, has made tremendous operational advancements in recent months despite some early reports that questioned its ability to support the goal of 300 flight hours per month in Afghanistan. Well, we're happy to report that in June 2011, during its very first full month of operational flying, Fire Scout provided 307 hours of support to ground troops and is on track to meet or exceed 300 hours for July.  We also continue to make solid progress on key development programs such as Navy UCAS, LEMV and BAMS and Aerospace Systems is intensely focused on the successful pursuit of new business opportunities, including UCLASS and the long-range strike program. Aerospace Systems is performing well. And despite its sales for the first 6 months of 2011 being down about 4% from last year, we see a stronger second half for the sector and believe its sales will end the year at about the same level as last year. Jim will cover the sector outlooks in a bit more detail in his comments.  During the quarter, Electronic Systems' Directional Infrared Countermeasure Systems, or DIRCM, achieved more than 1 million operational hours in service while demonstrating operational availability of more than 99%. ES continues to be a technology leader in non-kinetic products and systems such as those required for advanced electronic warfare. We expect this to be an increasingly important national security capability.  Information Systems sales have been impacted by the prevailing budget uncertainty. But they continue to have a robust set of new business opportunities, including the GMB development and sustainment program, the CAINS program and numerous cyber-related opportunities.  During this quarter, we also sold the San Diego County IT contract. This decision is consistent with our strategy of exiting lines of business that do not meet our standards of performance. And I might add, this decision was made in collaboration with our customer.  Technical Services had a solid quarter. Their results included higher logistics and modernization sales, consistent with our strategy for the sector. Also during the quarter, Technical Services received 1 of 3 awards for the $300 million Headquarters U.S. Air Force Civil Engineer Support Agency ID/IQ contract, and it will compete for cash quarters to support DoD Civil Engineering missions worldwide.  In closing, I'd like to reiterate that we continue to position the company for an increasingly competitive and challenging environment in which deficit reduction is becoming a higher priority for our national leadership. Our challenge is to continue to anticipate the needs of our customers, provide affordable, innovative solutions and aggressively address our cost structure, operational execution and our productivity.  As we demonstrated this quarter, we can create value in an environment of constrained top line growth by focusing on our key priorities: performance driven by strong execution, optimizing our portfolio and effectively deploying our cash.  So now I'd like to turn the call over to Jim for a more detailed discussion of results and our guidance. Jim?
James Palmer: Thanks, Wes, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I will begin my comments by providing a little bit more detail on our second quarter results.  As I look at the quarter, the highlights were segment operating margin rate expansion, which largely offset the impact of lower sales, higher total operating income, as well as margin rate and a 24% increase in underlying earnings per share. We are experiencing some headwind on the top line, and as I analyze the results for the quarter across our businesses, it looks to me about half of the variance last year includes things that we anticipated in our guidance for this year.  The Nevada joint venture participation reduction and NPOESS restructuring are examples of those types of items. The remainder of the variance I would attribute to second quarter budget pressure issues which largely impacted Electronic Systems and Information Systems. These budget pressure issues include the lingering impact of the 6-month continuing resolution, as well as announced troop drawdowns, delayed awards and the overall budget uncertainty, as well as customer conservatism that Wes talked about in his comments.  Moving to guidance of Slide 4, we now anticipate about a 2% reduction or $500 million in 2011 sales due to the budget pressures and troop drawdown. Clearly, we are operating in a highly dynamic environment, and our full year sales will reflect the evolving budget process in the second half of the year. But I want to go into a little bit more detail on a sector by sector basis.  So I'll start with Aerospace Systems, whose second quarter sales reflect the delayed awards for the F-35 and the E-2D programs, which lowered sales by about $150 million, as well as the NPOESS restructuring which represents in an additional $50 million impact in the second quarter. Before these 3 items, AS sales were within 2% of last year.  In terms of our outlook for the year, we view the impacts from F-35 and E-2D as timing issues. The finalization of these contracts and a higher volume on several other programs should allow us to recover sales during the third and fourth quarters. So, as Wes said, we continue to expect relatively stable sales for Aerospace Systems in 2011.  Aerospace second quarter operating income was roughly comparable to last year as improved program performance across several programs drove the margin rate in Aerospace to 12.8%, compared to 11.8% last year. Margin rate expansion largely offset the impact of lower sales in the quarter. And based on the strength of year-to-date operating income, we now expect Aerospace operating margin rate to be in the mid-11% range for the year.  Electronic Systems saw sales decline by nearly 10% due to lower deliveries under ID/IQ contracts for the Aerial com and the Vehicular Intercommunications Systems, or VIS, as driven by the announced drawdown of troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. Lower deliveries produced to programs reduced sales by about $130 million in the quarter. So as I look at sales for ES for the year, we now expect them to range between $7.3 billion and $7.4 billion for the year.  Despite the lower sales volume however, operating income increased 8% and margin rate expanded to 15.9% outstanding margin rate. The quarter's improvement reflects some positive adjustments on programs nearing completion in the land of self-protection systems and targeting system areas, as well as improved performance in intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance programs. A number of these performance improvements are non-recurring, so this quarter's strong margin rate is likely not sustainable. However, based on the first half results, we are raising the expected margin rate for ES to the mid- to high-13% range from approximately 13% previously.  In Information Systems, sales declined by 4% for the quarter, primarily due to lower volume on several programs in the Defense Systems part of the business. Operating margin for the quarter was 9.3% compared with 9.7% last year. You might remember that last year included an $18 million benefit related to a subcontractor risk retirement on the New York City Wireless program. So if we exclude that benefit from last year's operating margin rate, the rate would have been 8.8%. This quarter's results included a small pickup from the sale of San Diego County IT Outsourcing contract, but even excluding that pickup, the underlying IS margin rate improved on a quarter-over-quarter basis.  Similarly to ES, budget pressures are impacting the IS top line and now, we expect sales of about $8.2 billion for the year. Additionally, a part of this decline is also due to the sale of the San Diego IT contract that we talked about previously. We continue to expect an operating margin rate of about 9% for the IS business for the year.  Moving on to Technical Services, second quarter sales reflect our reduced participation in the Nevada National Security site joint venture, which represented sales about $150 million in the last year's second quarter. The change in the joint venture participation more than offset the higher sales for the logistics and services part of the business. Their operating income was comparable to last year and operating margin rate increased 130 basis points principally due to the change in the joint venture participation.  So we continue to expect sales of approximately $2.5 billion for TS for the year which largely, again, reflects that reduced participation in the joint venture and as well, contemplates the phaseout of some business lines that aren't meeting their return expectations. And we continue to expect the margin rate MTS to improve to about 8% for the year. So based on the strength of year-to-date results, we are increasing our estimate per segment operating margin rate to about approximately 11% for the mid-10% range and we now expect a total operating margin rate in the mid-11% range for the year. The increase in total operating margin rate contemplates the higher segment operating margin rate, an increase in the net pension adjustments from about $355 million to about $400 million of income. And an assumption of about $200 million for an unallocated corporate expense and potential risk items. The increase in our expected pension income is due to the finalization of our plan demographic analysis that we complete based on the population at the beginning of the year. Turning to cash. Through 6 months, cash provided by continuing operations before discretionary pension contributions improved by 21%. As expected, cash from continuing operations was low for the quarter and we continue to expect cash to be heavily weighted towards the second half of the year as has been our historical practice. As we mentioned last quarter, we did have some substantial cash outflows this quarter, including a $500 million discretionary pension contribution, as well as tax payments totaling about another $500 million.  I think I should also, Paul, provide a quick update on our share repurchase program. As Wes mentioned in his comments, we executed a $1 billion ASR program in early May, which immediately reduced our shares outstanding by 15.6 million shares. I would note until the ASR is completed under the terms of the contract, we're restricted from purchasing shares in the open market.  As Wes mentioned, we increased our guidance for 2011 EPS from continuing operations to $6.75 to $6.90. The guidance reflects an additional $0.10 for higher pension income, another $0.07 for a lower assumed diluted share counts and netting that pension and share count improvements against the impact of lower sales, that $500 million reduction in guidance for the year results in about a $0.03 to $0.04 improvement from our previous guidance. So the balance of the increase was driven by operating performance improvement in the sectors, or about $0.20 of the improvement, is due to that operating performance.  Finally, I should note that our guidance assumes that the national debt ceiling issue is successfully resolved in a timely manner.  So in conclusion, second quarter results demonstrate that we remain focused on generating shareholder value through performance, portfolio optimization and effective cash deployment.  That concludes my formal remarks, but before we begin, Q&A, I just wanted to mention that today is Paul Gregory's last conference call before he assumes a new role at Northrop Grumman here at the end of the month. I know many of you have enjoyed working with Paul and I want to personally acknowledge his strong contributions to our IR activities over the last 2-plus years.  Steve Movius who is currently the CFO of our Information Systems sector, will take over Paul's duties as the VP of IR here at the end of the month. So obviously I wish both of you, Paul and Steve, the very best in your new roles.  So at this point, I think we are ready for some Q&A.
Paul Gregory: Okay. Thank you, Jim, for those kind comments. And with that, Crystal, I think we're ready to move on to questions and answers.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.
Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank AG: The ES margins, Jim, can you size the ESC adjustments in there? Was it about $40 million?
James Palmer: I think that's a little high. The way I look at it, it's about -- I'll call it in a range of $30 million, $31 million. And without that margin rates are probably about mid $14 million for the quarter.
Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank AG: Okay. And the back half of the year's assumed rates of 13%, just more on mix. Anything else?
James Palmer: Yes, I'd say so.
Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank AG: Okay. And then, Wes, I guess a top little question or I have a little question for you. The incentives that you put in place for the last couple of years have really been focused on the margin of efficiency, the cash conversion and all those things are essentially playing out. The one thing that's been lacking, for purpose probably, has been any type of incentives toward sales growth. I'm curious, sales are coming in light and we're explaining that given the CR and down -- the down draft in operations. But do you think that you should put a carrot out there for sales growth in the future? And would that help the situation at all, or are we just in the realm of moving with wherever the budget growth is?
Wesley Bush: Well Myles, I appreciate the question because I think it's important to be able to convey how we think about sales in the company. At the beginning of last year, we stood back and thought a little bit about some of the challenges we had experienced over a number of years and really getting the level of performance out of the company that we needed, specifically around margin rate performance. And some of that went to looking carefully at our portfolio and really understanding what was performing and what was not performing. And in doing so, we needed to make some decisions, and we talked about it last year, we talked about it this year at the beginning of the year, that actually we're going to push ourselves down because we wanted to focus on higher quality sales in the organization. We also wanted to focus on sort of the mechanics of how we were putting those sales through the system in terms of how well we're going to negotiating our contracts and, of course, how well we're executing. So those have been sort of underlying perspectives that have made us, I think, sharpen our pencil a bit on which things we're really going to pursue, and also, really focus on how we're executing and negotiating on those. We have not forgotten the importance of sales in our business. I don't want anyone to think that, that is the case. In fact, our long-term incentives that are permeated throughout the organization, RONA, really does require growth for us to be able to capture those long-term incentive returns. So I would tweak your earlier statement a little bit that our sales incentive is more embedded in our long-term than it is in our annual. But we did that for a purpose because wanted to make sure that as we're capturing sales, they're generating long-term benefits to our company that it's not just to move the needle on a sales line that might eventually come back and bite us. So the focus in the company is on growth. That's important to us and that goes to the way that we've been shaping our portfolio. When I talk about portfolio optimization and our focus on unmanned and cyber and C4ISR and logistics, those are the areas that over the longer term and, as I said, it's going to take a little bit of time for our customers to get all this sorted out. But over the longer term, we see those as the areas where our customers are going to make their priority investments. And we think are going to serve the company well. So there's a little bit of reshaping that's been under way that has, as you pointed out, impacted the top line in a number of respects. But we think it's a little bit of the medicine that we needed to get us in the right place for the long term. I would point out, just back to your question on incentives, that our annual incentive plan does include awards. And so those awards are, of course, the seeds, the germination for the sales that we've gained over time. But as you know, there are good sales and bad sales, and we need to be very, very careful that we're not just given our credit for overruns on cost contracts or sales that really are not generating the level of returns that we need to be generating in our business. So I like incentivizing awards, I think that's the right place for us to be. And I like the sales perspective to be more of a long-term perspective because it forces us to think about the long-term actions that we're undertaking when we go after a certain bid. I don't know Jim, anything you'd like to add on that?
James Palmer: Obviously, since you and I were intimately involved in that process, I totally agree. Yes, I would also just point out that as you all know in our business, most of our sales are coming out of our backlog. Incentivizing sales is really reaping the benefit out of the backlog. Incentives around new business capture is really capturing activities that occur in the current year. That's why we've moved to awards versus sales in the annual plan.
Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank AG: That's helpful. I'm more curious and think that the strategy has worked. I'm more curious and if -- if and when the pendulum could swing too far. But I'll stick to one question.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies.
Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Paul, I don't know where going to -- it's going to be hard to start all over again, but nice job. Just to go back a little bit in terms of business opportunities, how do you -- Wes, this is a larger question also as opposed to the quarter, I mean, and there's 2 parts to it. One is, how do you convince your customer that he's not in the business of making your life more difficult because you've seen changes in contract terms that are unfortunate across a number of places. And then second is, how -- what sort of other opportunities? Could you be a little more specific in terms of things you think about as the second half unfolds?
Wesley Bush: Sure. Let me touch that first question first. Our customers' buying behavior has, I think quite frankly, out of necessity in terms of what they're dealing with, then shifting a little bit. A lot more focus on affordability than, perhaps, the value equation, I would say, sometimes. When we're looking at new competition, we're seeing a few more where cost is getting weighted more highly than performance. And so that's something that we are focused on, making sure that our business capture efforts are highly around -- focused around affordability. And quite frankly our continuing program activities are focused on affordability. I mentioned in my earlier remarks the work that we've been doing on Global Hawk on affordability jointly with the Air Force. And I've just been absolutely delighted to see how that's been embraced by both the Air Force and the folks of OSD in terms of working with us on this. They've recognize that it's not just about the contractor coming forward, turning the cost numbers down. It's about how we actually acquire some of these things. And that has been just a tremendous positive working approach to driving affordability in that program. We've really used that as a blueprint and spread it across the company to address just about every major acquisition activity that we have under way to really go back and press on requirements, press on the way that things are getting bought and quite frankly, press on the way we're executing to see if we can't turn those knobs on affordability even further, so that we can help the customer deal with just this intense pressure that they are having to cope with. The other part of the change in buying behavior, if you will, there's been, as you mentioned, the terms and conditions part of it and that one we're just having to take on one-by-one. In just about every case where there's a shift to go from, name it, cost plus to FPI or FP to FFP, we have to have the tough conversations about how you balance that out. Obviously, we can take on risk if we're compensated for it. And that becomes the discussion, and I would say those are sometimes a little bit more difficult discussions than we've had in the past, but that's where it is. And not every case that, does the customer decide that at the end of the day, wants to shift its contract form when faced with the bill for doing that. And so we simply have to be very clear with them early on. I think they have to be clear with us early on about what they're trying to achieve so that we can navigate to a more common place. Your question relating to the outlook in the second half of the year. Let me kind of cut that into a couple of pieces. Both AS, our Aerospace Systems business and Technical Services businesses, we believe, will continue on the track for the annual guidance that we gave at the beginning of the year and Jim went through that in a little bit of detail.  And so in AS, in particular, if I focus on that, as you know, we have a very nice portfolio of programs. There were few of those programs that relative to last year, the first half of this year weren't moving quite as quickly, either because of delayed awards or just a slower progress in how the customer was metering us on our activities. We have a pretty good transparency on the profile of that for the second half of the year. And as I mentioned in my remarks and Jim did in his, we've seen net net coming out of the year at AS at about the same as we were last year in total revenue. And that's just the accumulation program by program of what we're doing on production, primarily, in each of those areas. There's a little bit development activity there that makes up some of that difference as well. But it's fairly widely spread across the program base in AS. The other 2 sectors, IS and TS, as Jim indicated in his remarks, in both of those sectors, we have taken our guidance down a little bit for the year, primarily reflecting this slowness that we've seen in the way that the government is procuring things. And IS in particular is a much faster turnaround business so its contracts get rotated on a much more frequent basis, shorter-term contracting activities. And so they have been the most, I would say, impacted by that level of shift in that buying behavior. I don't think we're alone in that. If you look at how others are reporting this quarter in their similar businesses, we're all seeing about the same thing going on. So I don't see any negative differential there. ES is also impacted by that. As you know, ES has a number of ID/IQ vehicles, as well as other vehicles that are shorter duration. So they've been -- experienced that impact and then ES also, has had a little more exposure, particularly, to the Army. And I think if you're familiar, as we've gotten into this announced drawdown, I think the Army has slowed down on buying some of the higher rate items that it had been buying in the past. For example, our vehicular intercommunication systems, and a little bit, we've seen it as well with our Laser Rangefinder business. So those are the factors that drive it for us, but as we look at that profile and think about where we'll come up for the year, we have shifted our guidance a little bit to $27 billion. That's what seems to make sense for us.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein.
Douglas Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.: I just like to follow on that a little bit more. When you talk about the effect of the continuing resolution and the challenge that you saw on the budget earlier in the year, we seem to be at a point now where the customer, and I would say that in a combined sense, DoD and Congress, in a way, have certain objectives for spending in Defense, yet they're not really getting there. There's a gap because of these budget delays. Is it possible for you to quantify the size of this impact, and if you think that as we roll forward in the year, things get normalized, are we going to see a lot of that flow back, so you'll actually might see a surge in backlogs or revenues? Or is this something that we just may never close? In other words, we'll just muddle along and stay at these lower numbers.
James Palmer: Doug, this is Jim. We have a chart in our posted material that reconciles the change in guidance. And basically 2 items, just call it CR or delays or budget pressures, the bigger item, $300 million; and then drawdowns. Our assumption, frankly, is that as we go into the 2012 budget year, we're going to end up in another CR. And so there is just a slowness or molasses in the system, if you would characterize it that way, because of the real uncertainty of what budgets are going to be. That's just taking longer to get stuff done. It will be helpful once we ultimately get beyond the debt ceiling conversations, get into a 2012 budget, whatever it is, certainty is better than uncertainty. But right where we're seeing this hesitancy to act in some cases because of the need or the potential need, perceived need to maybe save a few dollars for just in case, our budget is less than I'd anticipated.
Douglas Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.: Well, and this -- I mean, it seems that as you've said have a stronger effect on the shorter cycle businesses, particularly Information Systems. And it struck me when you look at the margins that you've been able to deliver in the first 2 quarters there, which have been quite good, yet your guidance is only for 9% for the year, is that conservatism related to these issues, or do you expect something unit, in the business unit itself to change over time ?
James Palmer: I really don't expect anything to change in the business unit in the next 6 months or so, but I think it's also fair to say that the level of uncertainty that we are faced with, given those 2, what's going to happen with the budget, when are we going to get the debt ceiling issues resolved, all of those uncertainties are clearly greater than what we've dealt with over the last couple of years at this point in time. Well, I don't know if that's conservatism or whatever, but yes.
Douglas Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.: No. I understand. I mean, that's helpful.
Wesley Bush: Yes, Doug. It's Wes, let me just add. I do see in our interactions with our investment community, a desire to kind of get obviously, to get to the other side of this thing so that they have a better clarity around what their budgets are going to be and they can kind of get on with things. But until we kind of get to that place, I think we're going to see them continue, out of necessity, to hold back just a little bit to be able to sort through what this is all going to mean. As you know, with the arrival of our new secretary of defense Panetta and with the intersection of this budget challenge, the Pentagon is going through this mini QDR, they're calling it, to try and sort through how they really think about the military strategy and intersect that with their best understanding, as they can, of the budget realities. And I do think that there is some just sort of holdback in the system kind of waiting to see how that all sorts out. And you can hardly blame them. That's a very rational response to the situation. But I do see once we get through this, and I think it's going to take some time, as Jim pointed out, we're probably going to see another continuing resolution this year. I hope it's not as long as last year, but it's likely, given the challenges that everyone is facing up on the Hill, I think it's going to take a little bit of time. So if you detect us being a little bit conservative, it's because we're kind of seeing the dynamics of both the Hill community and the customer community with respect to what they're facing over the near-term. I do believe we're going to get to a point of more clarity around the budget here in the not-too-distant future which will enable the Pentagon to sort through its strategy. And we feel strongly when we come through that, the places where we're focused are going to be the places where priorities are being placed on investment. But if we're talking about the next few quarters here, I think we just need to recognize that this uncertainty can translate into where we are.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.
Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC: So you're moving your headquarters to the East Coast. Presumably, that will give you some cost savings. Could you tell us how much and could you tell us, in light of this more difficult environment, are you considering more dramatic headcount reductions like Lockheed did and more portfolio shaping moves in response to the current environment? And if so, can you give us any color on kind of how you think about that issue?
Wesley Bush: I would just say that we are aggressively working the cost equation in our company on every dimension. We obviously are, and I've mentioned this one in some of our prior calls, we're taking our corporate office size down about 25%, just in terms of headcount, just to quantify it a little bit as we're making the move. We are, and we have already made a number of reductions in headcount, primarily indirect headcount, across all of our sectors in the business. And we got out, I think, a little bit in front of that to make sure that we were doing the right things for an affordability equation over the last 2 years. But we're continuing to press on affordability very comprehensively. Some of that goes to our cost structure, in both organizational structure and our embedded cost. Some of that goes to the way we're managing our supply chain. And a lot of that goes to how we construct the offerings that we're putting forward to our customer community. We are a very innovative company and I would say historically, we've used that innovation to discriminate ourselves in terms of capability. We're going to continue to do that and one thing we're not going to do as we're cutting costs, we're not going to take the heart out of our investments for the future. But we are looking to redirect some of that innovation more towards affordability, not just capability. And I think that will help our positioning over time and I think it will help our customers as we bring forward ideas that will help deliver much of this capability for lower cost. So sometimes that's a difficult thing to get your head around because you become accustomed to a certain way of doing business. But comprehensively across the board, in our businesses, we are executing our business that way. I mentioned earlier Global Hawk, I think that's a good model. It's not a perfect model because it's not exactly the same set of issues as we see in other areas, but I think in terms of a model for how to work with the customer to really go after cost, it's a good lesson learned that we are applying broadly in the company.
Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC: And to the second part of the question at portfolio shaping. Is that getting increasing interest on your part?
Wesley Bush: We've been doing a lot of portfolio shaping. You might remember we divested TASC, you might remember that we spent out Shipbuilding, you might remember we decided to exit the State and Local IT Outsourcing business overtime...
James Palmer: Sold the EOS business ...
Wesley Bush: And then we sold the EOS business, earlier this year we announced the reshaping of our Technical Services portfolio. So you might can tell we kind of like portfolio shaping. There's a lot that we've been doing, we think it can create a lot of value. And I think any healthy company is always carefully examining its portfolio to make sure that we're really focused on the right things for the future. I'm not going to try and get up in front of it with any predictions on other things we might be doing. I would just point to our behavior over the past couple of years and characterize that as indicative of the way we think about value creation.
James Palmer: Cai, I would add that as we think about portfolio potentials, we tend to look at how well is the business performing, how well is the market performing, and how well are we positioned in the market to help us make decisions about whether or not that piece of the business is something that is really going to fit with our business on a go forward basis.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Heidi Wood with Morgan Stanley.
Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley: Paul, in addition to congratulations on your new horizons. Wes, congratulations on adding a new title of Chairman of the Board, as well as CEO now. That was nice to see. I'm going to gear my questions away from the domestic environment which you can't influence in and I'd like to -- Wes have you talk about the initiatives of expanding into the Northrop's growth overseas? I happen to see you in a UAE defense article. So it's clearly, you've got focus there. Can you tell us about what you're doing there?
Wesley Bush: Yes, absolutely. And let me characterize the international environment broadly as well so that there is kind of a good perspective on this. There are a number of areas around the globe, they're cutting back defense spending. And we have to be mindful of that when we think about our strategies and how we're positioning. There are other areas around the globe that not only are investing in defense but are kind of reshaping their priorities. And as we look at some of that reshaping that's going on, we are seeing a move into some of the areas where we do have, I would say, more discriminating capabilities. As I mentioned on some of our prior calls, one of the key factors in this for us is exportability. And I have welcomed those to have others in our industry, really welcomed the work that this administration is doing to stand back and take, I think, a more sensible approach to thinking about how we manage defense exports in our country. That has enabled us and others, I would say in our industry, to start having a little bit more expansive discussions with some of our allied partners around the globe on the potential for exporting some of our more modern capabilities. And I just point Unmanned as an example of that. As we've been thinking about the needs of our partners -- and what's interesting to me about this is if you go over into the field of operation, our partners are using these systems all the time, side-by-side with us. And so recognizing that reality, as we're thinking about export, I think is very important. But if I think about Unmanned for just a moment, we're seeing a growing interest in Global Hawk around the globe. And Fire Scout is another area of substantial interest. And that those areas of interest are both, I would characterize it in the Middle East, and throughout our partners, our allies in Asia, the Pacific rim. So that's an example. And we're continuing to focus our International business to Electronic Systems and IS and a little bit through TS as well. But I would say, perhaps, an interesting change to reflect on is what we're seeing in Aerospace Systems, primarily with Unmanned, but also the Manned systems, the E-2D program and, of course, we're big players on FA-18 and Joint Strike Fighter. So this will be a little bit lumpy around the globe but just because the customers are all different around the globe. Every country has its own set of priorities. But I would say compared to where we were just a few years ago, we're seeing a lot more forward-looking opportunity at Aerospace Systems than we have been seeing.
Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley: Just as a follow up, Wes, can you talk about M&A and your assessment as to whether you're seeing some attractive properties that might get dislodged and available for sale, given the budget outlook?
Wesley Bush: Well, I would say most of what we've seen came onto the market of late has had an extraordinarily high multiple attached to it. But we do look. We're going to be very disciplined about how we approach this. It's important for us to look, it's important for us be engaged in assessing what's out there in the market so that if there are opportunities to create value, we're going to be addressing those opportunities. But I think you will see us being disciplined.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada.
Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Jim, I thought I'd ask you on the OCO side of things. You noticed you had a bit of a knock in the quarter from the troop drawdown. I was wondering if you could size what you think your exposure might be to op tempo in military operations as of today? And whether you see any other business lines that could have pressures going forward from here?
James Palmer: In terms of OCO exposure, actually, we're not that large. But Electronic Systems, in addition to OCO, does have some, as we said, sales to the army itself in the regular budgets. We have some exposure there, if you want to characterize it that way. I think what we're seeing is more on the OCO side at this point. But -- and as what we have said in the past, it's relatively nominal probably that drawdown we're seeing in our guidance is much of our-OCO type activities.
Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: So what this done in 2011? We know obviously, the military is still busy in Afghanistan. How much more do you think there is left to go?
Wesley Bush: Our guidance for the year is that -- the $200 million drawdown.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi.
Jason Gursky - Citigroup Inc: Just 2 quick follow-up questions to things that have been asked earlier. You did go out of the way, this time, to quantify what you're describing as Army or OCO-related things in the Ops tempo. So I think it would be helpful for us all to know if you have the ability to quantify what's remaining if the OCO went to 0 over the next couple of years, what that might mean for you. And then secondly, just on Cai's question with regard to some of the actions that we've seen in other companies. Can you describe, for us, where your headcount sits today relative to where it did 5 years ago? It's gotten a little bit lost in light of the HII spending. It'd be just a good metric for us to all follow to get a sense of how much kind of cost actions might be left at Northrop at this point.
Wesley Bush: I think we're going to have Paul or Steve get back to you with any of those details.
Paul Gregory: And we generally don't do a sort of detailed accounting on headcount because it's a little bit -- in many of respects, not as meaningful as we shipped on some programs from what's internal to what external. And so I'd be reluctant to point to headcount as a measure of the action. You have to have to think a little bit more perceptive approach to looking at that. But obviously, our headcount is down. But I would just caution, Jason, as you're looking to what other companies are doing, we could go out tomorrow and announce a big headcount reduction, but that just might mean that we shifted cost someplace else. And so you have to look at the total cost for it for that to be a meaningful discussion.
James Palmer: But to try to put some of this into perspective, we did, 2 years ago combined 4 sectors into 2.
Paul Gregory: Absolutely.
James Palmer: In the process of doing that we reduced our cost about a couple of hundred million dollars in each of those combined sectors.
Paul Gregory: Right.
James Palmer: I do agree that headcount is not the right measure. You can simply outsource activities or subcontract the activities. But headcount is down.
Jason Gursky - Citigroup Inc: Okay. Maybe a better way then to ask that question is, as you look at it on the pipeline over the next several years, are margin rate sustainable at this point? And what do you have under your control to be able to sustain them?
Wesley Bush: As I've said a couple of times recently, I believe our long-term margin rate guidance, that we talked about through each of the 4 sectors are sustainable over the long term.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.
Samuel Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Jim, I just wanted to go back on the comment you made about pension. I guess, one is, can you repeat, I guess, why it's running higher than expected and what you're outlook is for this year? And then if you couple how performance looks, year-to-date, plus this $500 million contribution, how are you thinking about FAS/CAS as we go into next year at this point relative to this year?
James Palmer: Okay. So at the beginning of the year, given those headcount reductions that we just talked about, from combining the sector operations, I had a concern that our demographics that went into our initial estimate of FAS/CAS would be light. And so, I essentially hedged what was our pension income for potential demographic changes. We've now have completed our update, the demographics headcount, age of the population, years of service, all of that kind of stuff. And as it turns out, there were some changes in demographics but there were other impacts that offset it. So the estimate for the FAS/CAS pension difference for the year is $400 million. Previously, I had an estimate of $355 million. It is essentially finalized in the demographics. In terms of pension sensitivities, we've talked about these in the past but probably needs -- I do need to update them for the impact of the Shipbuilding spends. So let me just go through those real quick. For every 25 basis points change in the discount rate, either upwards or downwards, that's about a $65 million impact to that FAS/CAS difference on a go-forward basis. Likewise, our investment returns for every hundred basis points difference between our long-term rate of return assumption, which as you guys know is 8.5%. So if we were 7.5% or we were at 9.5% of that 100 basis points, I'd say $35 million impact to net pension costs on a go-forward basis. Frankly at this point, it's way too early to try to call what 2012 was going to be. As you know we don't set the discount rate until December 31. I don't even look at what the discount rate would be today because it's meaningless. I do look at that sensitivity that we've talked about. And Sam, I think those with that sensitivity, you have a perspective on where this could go for next year.
Wesley Bush: And can I just ask one other question. In terms of the buyback activity that you had and the agreement for May, since some of that actual buyback would occur and move into the third quarter, is there any sort of an assumption we should be using about what the ultimate settlement is in Q3?
James Palmer: It really is dependent upon actual purchases over time compared to the initial purchase price that was established which was an average cost of $64.17 through June. You'll see this in the Q when you get to Q. We're at an average cost of $65.02, as I recall. So at this point in time, if we just bought the rest of the shares at that $65.02, we owe on settlement, we would owe about $20 million or about 286,000 shares of stock. We have the ability, the option to sell in either cash or in stock, and obviously, we'll make those decisions once the program is completed. Probably in the third quarter sometime here.
Paul Gregory: I think, Crystal, that would wrap up our Q&A as we have used up our hour here. So we'd like to thank everyone for their participation. And, Wes?
Wesley Bush: Yes. Just again, thanks for joining us on the call today. As we go forward, we're going to continue our strategic focus on making sure that we are driving performance with outstanding execution in our company. As we talked about today, shaping our portfolio continues to be an important part of our strategy, and of course, our capital deployment strategy, returning cash to shareholders, is also critical to our overall approach to driving EPS improvements over time. So thanks, everyone, for your interest in our company. Thanks again for joining us today. Goodbye.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you so much for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a great day.

Operator: Good day and welcome to the First Quarter 2011 Northrop Grumman Earnings Teleconference. [Operator Instructions] I'll now turn the presentation over to your host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Paul Gregory. Sir, you may proceed.
Paul Gregory: Great, thank you, Candace. Good morning, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's First Quarter 2011 Conference Call. We've provided supplemental information in the form of a PowerPoint presentation that you can access at www.northropgrumman.com.  Before we start, please understand that matters discussed on today's call constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which are detailed in today's press release and our SEC filings, and may cause actual company results to differ materially.  During today's call, we'll discuss first quarter 2011 results and our 2011 guidance for continuing operations. Our first quarter results and our 2011 guidance reflect the spin-off of our Shipbuilding business, Huntington Ingalls Industries on March 31. Shipbuilding results for the first quarter are reported as discontinued operations in the press release and this quarter's 10-Q filing. Our results for discontinued operations may not reflect Huntington Ingalls' results of operations or financial condition as an independent publicly owned company.  On the call today are our CEO and President, Wes Bush; and our Chief Financial Officer, Jim Palmer. At this point, please go to Slide 3, and I'd like to turn the call over to Wes.
Wesley Bush: Thanks, Paul. So good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. On today's call, we'll discuss first quarter highlights and our outlook for the rest of the year.  First quarter financial results were strong, and we're off to a solid start for the year. We completed the spin-off of Huntington Ingalls Industries to Northrop Grumman's shareholders on March 31. Our shareholders received 1 share of HII for every 6 years in Northrop Grumman. Along with providing greater investor choice, we believe that the separation of the businesses supports value creation for the shareholders, customers and employees of both companies.  Today, we also announced that we are raising our dividend and increasing our outstanding share repurchase authorization to $4 billion, which includes committing the $1.4 billion spin-off contribution to share repurchases. This approach means that the full value of the Shipbuilding business will be transferred to our shareholders.  I want to acknowledge the hard work of everyone involved in successfully executing the spin-off. I also want to thank Mike Petters, the CEO of Huntington Ingalls, and his team for their contributions to Northrop Grumman. And finally, I'd like to thank the Navy for their constructive engagement throughout the spin-off process.  Northrop Grumman is now much more sharply focused on our core markets. Integrated C4ISR, Cybersecurity, Unmanned Systems and Logistics. Our 4 sectors are well-positioned and have tremendous opportunities for collaboration synergy. As a management team, we are looking forward to maximizing our opportunities in these markets.  While we believe the company's portfolio is well aligned with our customers' priorities, we always look for opportunities to improve performance and alignment, including continued portfolio shaping. As a management team, we are also focused on improving our execution and cost competitiveness, while maintaining flexibility in a rapidly changing environment. Our priority is to position Northrop Grumman for success in an increasingly competitive environment. Turning to financial highlights for the quarter on Slide 4. Earnings per share from continuing operations rose 25% to $1.67. On a consolidated basis, our segment operating margin rate expanded by 50 basis points. Our leadership team continues to focus on sustaining and building on the substantial performance improvement we achieved in 2010. All 4 sectors delivered higher operating income, and each of the sectors is building a track record of consistent execution. Operating income increased 19%, reflecting higher pension income, stronger segment operating income and lower corporate expenses. Our year-over-year sales variance was primarily driven by the decision to reduce our participation in the Nevada National Security Site joint venture. Excluding this change, first quarter sales would've been relatively comparable to last year. So our top line has been fairly resilient, despite operating under the continuing resolutions for the last 6 months.  Our experience is that the series of CRs, held up new contracts and also negatively influenced customer willingness to spend on some existing contracts and programs in order to preserve funds should the CR have continued.  Sales for Aerospace Systems were slightly higher in the quarter due to increased volume from manned aircraft, Unmanned Systems and restricted programs, which more than offset declines in civil space programs. Aerospace Systems ended the quarter with a $20 billion backlog and continues to have several large pending awards, including LRIP 4 [low-rate initial production Lot 4] for the F-35 and the latest multiyear for the F/A-18. Sales for Electronic Systems and Information Systems, our shorter cycle businesses, were more impacted by acquisition delays caused by domestic and international budget uncertainties. And at Technical Services, the sales decline was solely the result of our strategic decision to reduce our participation in the Nevada National Security Site joint venture. That decision also reduced our backlog by $1.7 billion.  At the end of the quarter, total backlog, adjusted for the HII spin-off, was $43.7 billion. New business awards for the quarter totaled $5.3 billion, and at the end of the quarter, total backlog represented about 1.6x sales. While budget uncertainty is a reality, and reductions to certain programs are likely inevitable, we believe we will continue to see strong demand in our core integrated C4ISR [command, control, communications and computers, and intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance systems], Unmanned Systems, Cybersecurity and Logistics markets. Given the challenges of a regular warfare and other emerging threats, investments and persistence awareness through integrated C4ISR systems are essential to global security.  We have a strong, broad foundation of capabilities and mission expertise in C4ISR, and we continue to work with our customers to expand our C4ISR capabilities. In particular, we're developing advanced multifunction sensors and network capabilities with open system architectures to meet emerging customer information needs.  We're also developing new concepts for more agile and persistent ISR [intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance] capabilities, which integrate airborne and space platforms using a balanced mix of manned and unmanned systems that can address a broad range of security challenges. Examples in this area are our BACN [Battlefield Airborne Communications Node] system, LEMV [Long Endurance Multi-Intelligence Vehicle] and the migration of our flexible unmanned architecture model to additional platforms, such as the Bell 407 helicopter.  We also believe that investment in Unmanned Systems will be a priority, both domestically and internationally. As Global Hawk continues to demonstrate its robust C4ISR capabilities across a multitude of military and nonmilitary global missions, ranging from monitoring developments in the Middle East to gathering information on the aftermath of the earthquake in Japan, we are seeing increased international interest in this versatile platform.  Development of BAMS [Broad Area Maritime Surveillance], its maritime derivative, is proceeding well, and we would expect this platform to demonstrate a similar level of mission versatility. And we continue to extend our technological leadership and broaden the capabilities and missions of our Unmanned Systems, with the development of platforms ranging from the fixed wing UCAS-D [Unmanned Combat Air System Demonstration] to rotary-wing platforms like Fire Scout and Fire-X.  We continue to invest in and capture Cybersecurity work, and we are currently providing advanced cybersecurity technology to the defense and intelligence communities. Our acquisition of Essex several years ago, brought unique capabilities and customer intimacy that successfully supported our growth in this area. We expect the demand for advanced Cybersecurity solutions to continue to expand. This growth will be driven by investment in unique Cybersecurity opportunities, as well as the broader recognition of the need to embed Cybersecurity in our critical systems. We believe we are also well-positioned in Logistics, where we expect continued growth in the maintenance, repair and overhaul or MRO market, as pressure on the investment accounts drives the need for service life extension of existing platforms. We are a major player in this area, currently providing MRO services for the B-2, Joint STARS, KC-10, U.K. AWACS, A-10 and the C-20.  And this month, our Lake Charles Maintenance and Modification Center was selected the 2011 MRO Facility of the Year in the military MRO category by Aviation Week and Overhaul & Maintenance magazines. The Lake Charles Maintenance and Modification Center provides maintenance, repair and overhaul support to platforms such as Joint STARS and KC-10. Our portfolio is also well-aligned with longer-term opportunities, including the long-range strike initiative and emerging directed energy and non-kinetic products and systems. We have a number of activities underway to position Northrop to compete successfully for the long-range strike initiative. And our solid-state directed energy laser demonstrated its capability in a Navy exercise, in which a small moving vessel was successfully targeted and disabled. We believe that our capabilities and technologies are vital to global and national security, and that the need for our products and services will continue. Our actions on the dividend and share repurchase authorization demonstrate the confidence we have on our portfolio, our ability to execute and our outlook for continued strong cash generation. After the spin-off with the Shipbuilding business, which represented approximately 20% of our annual sales, we are not only maintaining our quarterly dividend but increasing it by more than 6% to $0.50 per share or $2 per share on an annualized basis.  Looking ahead, based on this quarter's performance, we now expect earnings per share from continuing operations to range between $6.50 and $6.70. In closing, I would reiterate that we continue to position the company for an increasingly competitive and challenging environment. Deficit reduction is becoming a higher priority for our national leadership, as deficit and debt levels are widely expected to be unsustainable. It's likely that there will be a significant amount of debate in the coming months regarding deficit reduction and defense spending.  Our challenge is to continue to anticipate the needs of our customers and aggressively address our cost structure, operational execution and productivity. As I've said before, ours is not a top line story. We believe that we can continue to create value for our shareholders even in an environment of constrained top line growth by focusing on our key priorities: building on our performance improvements, optimizing our portfolio and effectively deploying our cash. We're off to a very good start to the year with our first quarter results. So now I'll turn the call over to Jim, for a more detailed discussion of results and guidance. Jim?
James Palmer: Thanks, Wes, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. My comments will begin on Slide 5, where I'll provide a little bit more color on our first quarter results, which as Wes said, is a great start to the year.  Highlights for the quarter were the higher segment operating income and a 10.7% segment operating margin rate, improved total operating income and margin rate due to higher pension income and lower corporate unallocated expense. A 25% in earnings per share driven by the higher segment operating income and pension income, with lower corporate unallocated and interest expense. Our higher tax rate for the quarter was offset by the impact of this quarter's lower share count. Moving to the segments. Aerospace Systems had a solid quarter, with a 1% sales growth and a 2% increase in operating income. Margin rate for the quarter was unchanged at 11% and in line with our guidance for the year. Higher sales for the quarter reflected higher volumes for manned programs, including an additional F-18 delivery, as well as higher volumes for unmanned systems and restricted programs. The increase in operating income is consistent with the higher volume for the quarter.  For the year, we continue to expect relatively stable Aerospace revenue, characterized by volume increases for manned, unmanned and restricted programs, which will be offset by lower volume for civil space programs. In particular, as work on MPOS transitions to the new Defense Weather Satellite System, we expect a decline in civil space sales. For example, in the first quarter, volume for MPOS declined by about $80 million on a year-over-year basis. In Electronics, sales declined by 4% for the quarter, and as we mentioned in last quarter's call, we expected ES [Electronic Systems] to have a slower start in the first half of the year due to lower ID/IQ deliveries for LAIRCM [Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasures] and the vehicle intercommunication systems or VIS, as well as some delays that we experienced last year in international programs.  Despite the lower sales volume, operating income increased 5% and margin rate expanded 110 basis points to 13.1%. The strength in operating income reflects improved performance for Land & Self Protection Systems and the Postal Automation Program.  For the year, we expect ES revenues to be relatively stable, but we may experience some softness in -- if delays in international awards and acquisition delays continue. We continue to expect an operating margin rate of approximately 13% in this business. Information Systems also generated strong operating income from the quarter, despite slightly lower sales. Sales volume reflects a restricted programs transition from development to maintenance and lower volume for the counter-narcoterrorism ID/IQ program, as well as an impact from the continuing resolution.  Operating income increased 6% for the quarter and margin rate expanded 70 basis points to 9.6%. Improved program performance more than offset the decline in volume. For the year, we continue expect low single-digit revenue growth, with a margin rate of approximately 9% in this business. Similar to Electronic Systems, we could experience some softness relative to our sales guidance, depending on the timing of new awards and the continued budget uncertainty. Moving on to Technical Services. First quarter sales declined by 10%, with the single biggest factor contributing to that decline being our reduced participation in the Nevada National Security Site joint venture. As I think you know, effective January 1, we no longer consolidate revenue for this joint venture, which had sales of $136 million in last year's first quarter.  Higher sales for the KC-10 program, which began in earnest last February, partially offset the impact of the joint venture. TS [Technical Services] operating income increased 10% and margin rate increased 140 basis points. Higher operating income reflects improved program performance, with the margin rate expansion for the quarter primarily due to the change in the joint venture revenue recognition.  We continue to expect sales of about $2.5 billion for TS, which reflects that reduced participation in the joint venture and contemplates the phaseout of some business lines that are not meeting our return expectations. And we continue to expect a margin rate in TS to improve to approximately 8%. On a consolidated basis, we expect a total operating margin rate of approximately 11% for the year and we continue to expect a net pension adjustment of about $355 million or so for the year. So the major drivers of this quarter's earnings per share growth were the improved pension cost, higher segment operating income, lower corporate unallocated expenses and lower interest expense, were also important contributors to earnings per share growth, with a lower share count offset by a higher effective tax rate.  Turning to cash. As expected, cash from operations and free cash flow were seasonably low, but much better than last year's first quarter results. Cash from continuing operations was $112 million and free cash flow, which was an outflow of $11 million after capital expenditures and related outsourcing contract and software cost. Both cash from operations and free cash flow were stronger this year, with the improvement principally driven by the more positive working capital trends. And as we've said, during last quarter call, we expect cash to again be heavily weighted towards the second half of this year. At the end of the quarter, our cash balance was just over $4 billion, reflecting the $1.4 billion contribution from HII and our strong cash generation at the end of 2010. Out of abundance of caution related to the disclosure process surrounding the spin-off, as well as the likely reduction in our stock price after the spin-off, we took a pause in our share repurchase program in the first quarter. But with the increase in our authorization, we will resume our share repurchases. So looking ahead, I expect that we will have a significant drawdown of cash in the coming months. Along with the share repurchases, we have 2 tax payments that we need to make in the second half -- or second quarter, rather, that total approximately $500 million. And as I said before, we anticipate making a discretionary pension contribution in this quarter, second quarter, that will total approximately another $500 million. So in conclusion, good first quarter. Those results demonstrate positive trend in operations, improved pension expense and the optimization of our portfolio. We remain focused on generating shareholder value through performance improvements, optimization of our portfolio and effective cash deployment.  And Paul, with that, I think we're ready to turn it over for some questions.
Paul Gregory: Great, thank you, Jim. Candace, I think we're ready to go to Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Robert Spingarn of Crédit Suisse.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG: High-level question, Wes, you've been probably one of the earliest to recognize the pressure in DC and fairly responsive to that, I would say, over the last year or so. How do you see your backlog evolving in the various segments as we go forward here? I know you've been clear this is not a top line story, but if you could just give us a little sense for how the 4 segments move up and down over the course of the next few quarters? And then a question for Jim on the cadence of the share repurchase.
Wesley Bush: Sure. All right, let me start with the question on the backlog. I think it's important to decompose it, and I also think as we have completed the spin out of HII, it's a good opportunity to kind of stand back and reflect on the portfolio and how backlog looks for different portfolio elements. Historically, with Shipbuilding inside of Northrop Grumman, we had 2 substantial sectors that were platform-driven and whose backlog would come in the big lumps that typically go with the platforms. And today, we are 1 of our 4 sectors that is platform-driven and that's AS [Aerospace Systems]. And if you look at our report on backlog there, you'll see a backlog that is characteristic of the large platform businesses that's running close to 2x annual sales. Our other businesses are typically shorter cycle businesses in terms of the duration of their contracts. And they also are businesses that tend to have a higher volume of ID/IQ business that doesn't reflect into the backlog the same way that the other contracts do. And so you'll see lower multiples of annual sales in the backlogs for those businesses. Together, as I indicated in my remarks, about 1.6x is kind of where we're running today. Your question was more forward-looking though, and my view on that really goes to where we see some of these pressures going that may have implications on things like production rates on platform businesses, I think that will put some pressure there. We feel a little bit more positive about that because of the heavier reliance that we have on Unmanned Systems, which we think are going to get perhaps a little bit more of the relative share of investment. So we like that positioning on unmanned. But I would expect a little bit more volatility over time. And the platform business is not just ours, but across our industry, given the scrutiny that's going to be applied, I think, more broadly to how much the nation can afford in terms of production rates. The other businesses, I think, are going to tend to trend to about the levels of backlog multiples that we're seeing. Now there's going to be overall pressure on sort of a total top line, and so you can argue about where the top line goes. But in terms of backlog to sales ratios, the level of multiples, I think, is generally indicative of the way the customer executes its business, whether we're in a more robust top line environment or reduced top line environment. So as a multiple of sales, I think that model is probably fairly consistent. So I hope that answered your question, Robert. And then, Jim, you were going to answer...
James Palmer: Yes. Bob, on your question on cadence on share repurchase, a couple of thoughts here. You'll recall that at the beginning of the year, I said that our guidance for the year anticipated a modest reduction or modest share repurchase program for the year. It clearly contemplated the pause that we had in the first quarter. Frankly, we didn't know for sure when the Shipbuilding spin would be completed. As we said in our guidance for the year, we anticipated it would be completed during the year, but didn't really peg a time for when that would be completed. We do, as we said in the press release announcing earnings and the share authorization increase, we're in the market from time to time. We normally don't give a time frame for when we're going to complete that $4 billion authorization that we have. But probably the best way to try to address your question is to address it from the perspective of the guidance for the year. And as I'd look at guidance for the year, I contemplate a range of share repurchase alternatives. A range of operating improvements as well. And I think it's fair to say that the guidance at this point contemplates about a 3.5% reduction in the average shares outstanding for the year.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Doug Harned of Sanford Bernstein.
Douglas Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.: On IS, on basically, Information Systems, you had very good margins for the quarter. Could you talk about where that unit's headed in terms of margin longer term? And I know it's been great that we haven't talked a lot recently about the state of Virginia and the San Diego County, and maybe you could give an update on those or do we have those issues really behind us now?
James Palmer: Let me talk about margins, and I think Wes will add a couple of comments on the other 2 programs as well. For quite a while now, Rob -- or Doug, we've talked about 9% margins in this business, as where we thought the business ought to perform. Clearly, we'd like to push it above that. But 9% is our guidance for the year. We were at 8.9% as I recall for last year, 9.6% this quarter. This quarter did have some increased deliveries on some programs that have some hardware associated with improved margins with them. You expect that to kind of tail off as we go through the year here. So that's why we're looking at about a 9% for the year. Clearly, all of us were incentivized to do better than that. And I kind of think the 9% or so, a little bit on the upside is where this business ought to be and where we're driving it to be.
Wesley Bush: All right, and Doug, you asked about the county of San Diego and VITA [Virginia Information Technologies Agency], I would say, both have come long way in terms of stabilization. County of San Diego operating quite well. With respect to VITA, we see continued steady improvement on the performance there. Our first step on VITA has been transforming the environment across a very widely disparate set of IT systems, transforming that into a new state-of-the-art environment. And that transformation process on VITA is nearing completion. The agencies that we have transformed are seeing good, steady performance and performance improvements. We are still occasionally experiencing some challenges in the few remaining agencies that are continuing to operate under their older legacy, if you will, environments. And so from time to time, we see those flare up with issues, but we believe those issues will be mitigated as we complete the transformation process. We are working very, very closely with the Commonwealth [Commonwealth of Virginia] on that remaining transformation schedule. And we see that as on the right track. The program, I think as you know, continues to operate at a loss. That is not an attractive business proposition for us at all, but we are committed to be operating effectively with the Commonwealth to meet our commitments and make sure this thing operates and is transferred very successfully. And I think we're making really good progress on that.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Howard Rubel of Jefferies.
Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Jim, these are all for you, sorry, Wes. And it's all sort of related some of the financial metrics that you talked about. First, could you -- the dividend increase sort of points to a 30% payout ratio and maybe you could, so there's sort of 3 parts to this. One, is could you sort of address what you're thinking about your payout ratio? What you're thinking about rolling up [ph] a return on invested capital going forward, because that's sort of part of our where you're going to go if you're not going to grow a lot, you got to maximize the return on equity. And then third, if I did the math right, 3.5% shrink to the shares is only like $600 million. And I thought you said, you are committed to the $1.4 billion for the purchase of the stocks. So is there a loose end there?
James Palmer: So a couple of thoughts here. On the 3.5%, that's from last year's weighted average shares. We lost -- obviously, issued shares -- share in the first quarter for our annual incentive compensation program. So new options, new performance shares. So that's an upper to last year's weighted average shares that you probably haven't factored into that analysis or calculation. And again, realize we're not going to be able to start our share repurchases until this information is public for a number of days. And so when you look at weighted average shares, it's going to take more than your dollar amount, the $600 million you talked about, to affect that weighted average shares for the year. In terms of payout ratios and yields, we actually look at both payout ratios and yield, pay more attention to payout ratios. We look at payout ratios both on a GAAP basis, as well as a pension-adjusted basis and in relationships to our peers. And yes, we target around let's call it a 1/3 or 30%-type of payout ratio. And as you know, RONA [return on net assets] is one of our objectives, long-term performance measures that our team has incentivized on. So we've worked to improve RONA. Holding cash is not very effective, so yes, there is some incentive to go deal with the cash balance as it relates to RONA. Did I get all your questions, Howard?
Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Yes, more or less.
Wesley Bush: There's just one other perspective, there's the math that goes with the share repurchase. I would just say, it's also instructive to look at our history. When we get a share repurchase authorization, we execute to make sure we get things done and on a meaningful timeline. So I think we have a pretty good history there as well.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank.
Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank AG: Wes, you talked about ISR, Cyber, Unmanned and Logistics as being kind of the marquee headline businesses you want to be in. How much of your portfolio today directly fits into those buckets? And then in the context of portfolio shaping, is it that you want to wind down towards centering on those buckets and anything that's not in them is in play? Or is this more the direction of where you want to go out and acquire?
Wesley Bush: Yes, Myles, I think I would characterize those areas as the predominance of focus. They are 4, we're a company that this year is $27.5 billion in annual revenue that we're driving towards, so certainly not everything, either does nor should, fit into 4 specific categories. We highlight those though to make sure that there's some clarity around the way we think about alignment with the customers' emerging needs. So they are not, if you will, criteria that we're using to determine, perhaps in or out on the portfolio. They are more intended to serve as a way of framing the way we think about investing. The way we think about aligning capabilities internally, where we see substantial opportunities for our 4 businesses to work together to create synergy. They do represent a large fraction of our portfolio. We've not broken that out publicly in the past, I'm going to be a little bit careful about doing that. But it is a substantial fraction of our sales. You asked a little bit about M&A as well. From my perspective, we have what we need in these areas. We're not looking at a big gap from a capability perspective. We do look in the marketplace to see what emerging capabilities might augment that over time, but given the strength of the portfolio we have in these areas, I don't feel that we need to take any dramatic actions that will be a departure from the disciplined approach that we've taken in our investment philosophy. So it's not a laying of the groundwork, if you will, for some substantial M&A program here. It is more intended to provide a very solid framework for how we're thinking about the move forward on the company, the alignment with where we see the customer going and how we're shaping our priorities for investment.
Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank AG: That's really helpful. One quick follow-up to that, you mentioned portfolio shaping, I'm curious if you can size what kind of level of portfolio shaping you need to stay being on the table in 12 to 24 months.
Wesley Bush: Yes, it is -- it will be a product of the continued activity that we go through. We have a pretty robust program internally to decompose our portfolio, not necessarily just along the lines of our organizational structure, but along the lines of what our customer is doing, along the lines of the market trends that we see. We also look at financially in terms of performance metrics. So we decompose it routinely to try and look forward into where we see the market going. And in those areas where we see departures from our ability to generate value, either through just the straightforward operations of that part of the business or through synergy, we want the different parts of the businesses to be working together so that we can generate more value. Where we see departures from those criteria, we look at whether or not we might be able to create more value for our shareholders and our customers and our employees by separating. And we've been doing this now, rather routinely, for a number of years. We have divested elements of our Electronic Systems portfolio over the last few years, and I think very effectively executed on those. We've divested components of our Information Systems business most notably the TASC business, and then of course the most recent substantial activity with the spin out of our Shipbuilding business. I think those are reflective of the way we think about portfolio management from -- is it generating synergy and where is it going. So I wouldn't want to call out any specific actions we might take, but I would want to emphasize the fact that we do think that active portfolio management is a key part of value creation opportunity that we see going forward, particularly in the environment where things are going to continue to shift.
James Palmer: Wes, I just might add that those actions, Shipbuilding, TASC, Electronics activity, that's $8.5 billion of revenue over the last 2 years, 2 plus years that have been addressed.
Wesley Bush: Yes, so that's pretty active.
James Palmer: Yes.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Joe Nadol of JP Morgan.
Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co: My question, I hate to come back to the topic, but I'm going to ask it a little differently. And that's on the share repurchase again. And I'm really trying to get at is what you're committing to in terms of total share repurchase, because as a matter of course, you guys have made over $1 billion per year, each for the last several, anyway. You're committing this $1.4 billion, but is that in addition to the share repurchase activity we could normally expect, say as a percentage of your cash flow. Or is that sort of funding the normal share repurchase? And the second part of it, Wes, and or Jim, as you thought about the share repurchase and what you're going to do with this dividend from Huntington, did you consider a special dividend? And if so, what were the various factors that you went back and forth with? Why did you come up with share repurchase as opposed to a dividend?
James Palmer: So Joe, let me try to clarify here. The $1.4 billion, obviously, is the contribution that we received from the Shipbuilding. And what we tried to say is that, in thinking about our total authorization, we added that amount to what we had currently and some additional amount to get to the $4 billion authorization that obviously the board approved. That does not mean that we're going to spend $1.4 billion in the quarter or in the year. Frankly, some of the analysts, I think, have gotten a little bit ahead of us on what we were going to do for this year, because as I said in the year end call, we said modest reduction, contemplating the pause that we had put in place for our share repurchases. My comment to this is [indiscernible] that, Rob, on the share repurchases for this year that the guidance anticipates about a 3.5% reduction in the average shares outstanding for the year. So you can essentially do the math of recognizing that we had very little share reduction in the first quarter. We're only going to be able to start share repurchases here sometime in May. And so to get that kind of 3.5% reduction over the year, with the increase that we've already had in shares outstanding with the new grants in February, we're going to spend a reasonable amount of cash this year on share repurchases. Could we do more? Potentially. But let's take this in steps as we go through the year.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Cai Von Rumohr of Cowen and Company.
Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC: Not to beat the dead horse, but this authorization is $4 billion, the last couple have been for $2 billion to $2.5 billion. And if you kind of look, as you did suggest that we should look at what you've been doing. You essentially completed your full authorization in the past. It looks like in approximately 18 to 24 months, and so you've given us some of the tactics here on why the first quarter and second quarter will have that impact. But would it be realistic for us to expect you, as you have in the past, to get up to a run rate therefore of $2 billion or more?
Wesley Bush: Yes, Cai, I think -- this is Wes, let me just give you my perspective. We don't want to be very explicit about the timing or quantity of a share repurchase program. We want the flexibility to do it intelligently. And I think there is a very strong signal here that we didn't just say, "All right, here's the $1.4 billion from Shipbuilding. Let's go and just have that be our authorization and go work on it." As Jim indicated, we added it to, didn't replaced it with, we added it to an outstanding repurchase authorization that we had, and then we add a little bit more. So there's an important signal about the way we're thinking about creating value through cash deployment in the company. But as we have been, I think we have a really good track record of how we've done share repurchase. We are thoughtful about each of the steps we enter into. We're thoughtful about the mechanism that we use and the pace and we're going to continue to use that methodology going forward. So we're probably not going to say much more here at all about the pace going forward. But again, I think there's a lot to be learned by looking at what we've done in the past. It continues to shape the way we think about going forward.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Robert Stallard of Royal Bank of Canada.
Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Just a couple of questions at Jim, actually, on the financial side. Jim, I was wondering if you could give us an idea of where you think inventory and CapEx is going to trend from here, obviously, now that Huntington is gone? And whether there's an opportunity to bring those down and also the progress you've made so far and expect going forward on bringing down the head office expense?
James Palmer: Yes, in terms of CapEx, I would look for about $600 million to $700 million kind of for this year. If we have a slowdown in revenue, clearly, it will come down as we go forward, but kind of the $600 million to $700 million is I think a reasonable range for us. It's about equal to depreciation and amortization. So in a kind of flattish environment, I look for that kind of relationship between our investment in the business and amortization of cost. In terms of progress on home office cost, we still have the challenges that I've talked about in the past, that we're going to have some stranded cost or cost inefficiencies, that come from loss of the $6.7 billion in our base from Shipbuilding. We are working on addressing that. As I said in the past, it probably going to take us anywhere from a year or so, maybe 2 years, to be able to fully address those costs, so that doesn't have an impact on the organization on a go-forward basis. We're in the front end of working on that. Clearly, the move to DC is an opportunity to deal partially with those costs. But I think that's essentially where we are at this point, Rob.
Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: I'm kind of just wondering on inventories as well.
James Palmer: On inventories, I don't see a whole lot of change. Clearly, I'm pushing, we're pushing the organization to reduce them. But I think we're fairly efficient today in our working capital. It's always the big variance in our cash flow forecast for the year. We've normally can look at our EBITDA and cash taxes and cash interest and have a good sense of where they're going to come out, and the variable that goes into our cash guidance for the year is essentially the working capital variance. As you know, in years past, we've been able to reduce working capital at the same time while growing sales, which is obviously a difficult challenge, but have been able to do that. We're not as efficient last year in working capital, so I think we have some opportunities going into this year, and reflected in our range of guidance for cash. And I made it in broader that inventory, it's essentially working capital.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo.
Samuel Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Two questions, if I could. One, is Electronic Systems, you made a comment about international contract award delays. And I'm wondering is that a decision by the customer? Or is that they have made the decision and they've actually haven't giving you the contract? Can you talk a little bit more about that. And then just secondly, on the F-35, I'm surprised we still haven't seen the LRIP 4, and I'm just wondering why is it taking so long? And when we get to LRIP 5, will there be as big of a gap between when Lockheed gets the contract versus you?
Wesley Bush: Yes, Sam, let me take both of those, it's Wes. On the Electronic Systems, our reference there was not to an individual issue, it was a little bit more broadly. That some of the international budget environments have actually held up some of the contract awards that we've been working on for some time. We see delays there. Although, I would say in some countries there's some downward pressures that are some are even more severe than what we're seeing here, but it's primarily delays that we've been observing. On F-35, on LRIP 4, as you're probably aware, and I'm sure been interacting with our prime Lockheed Martin on this, there is a very, very strong focus on the part of the customer on affordability and how we get the program on a trajectory that is going to make sense, both to the U.S. and for our partner countries, that has resulted in a process on LRIP 4 of kind of standing back and making sure that we're all collectively doing the things we need to do to support getting to the right outcomes there. And it has delayed the contracting discussions, as we have focused both on contract type and of course the actual valuations. So that's taking a little bit longer. I think the groundwork we're doing on LRIP 4 is going to help pave the way for future LRIP discussions. But there is a lot of work to be done on this program to get it to where it needs to be from an affordability perspective. And I think, you're seeing a reflection of that in this timing.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of David Strauss of UBS.
David Strauss - UBS Investment Bank: Wes, could you address Global Hawk, the outlook there? Obviously, we had another Nunn-McCurdy, how it did in the fiscal '11 budget? And then, how it looks in the fiscal '12 budget? And what you're doing from your side to contain costs on the program?
Wesley Bush: Sure. Global Hawk is a program that we're really, really proud of. We never like to see anything like a Nunn-McCurdy breach occur. That's not a happy place to be. But I do think there was a lot of clarity in the discussion that the department provided to the Hill. Clarity that the primary reason for the Nunn-McCurdy breach was the reduction of the Block 40 quantities from, I believe, 22 down to 11 aircraft due to the budget pressures and the other pressures that the Air Force is dealing with. There were some other issues identified, like the managing manufacturing source issues on the ground segment. Getting some of the depots stood up because we're operating this thing all over the globe in a much more aggressive manner than was ever anticipated, when the original plan was created for this program and that's the original plan against which the Nunn-McCurdys are measured. If you look at what we're doing with this, we're flying Global Hawks with around-the-clock operations today in the Persian Gulf, in Japan, in North Africa. They are, to some extent, the victims of their own success in terms of being so successful from a mission perspective, that we're sort of scrambling to keep up with them from a budget perspective. Turning the clock back about a year ago, the department, the Air Force was very clear that they were not happy with the trajectory on affordability on Global Hawk. We made commitments and have worked very closely both with the Air Force acquisition teams. Dave Van Buren's been very involved in this as has Ash Carter. We've come a long way on affordability, and I'm very pleased to see the trajectory that we're on there. And I think the department is also pleased to see where we're headed. I think this is a program with very long legs. It's demonstrating such an enormous diversity of capability, whether it's on the surveillance side with the different mission sensors that were flying, and even more recently on the communication side with the BACN payloads that we're putting on the Global Hawk. So we're looking forward to continuing to deliver a whole range of capability, different versions of this very exceptional system to the Air Force. And as I mentioned in my remarks, the maritime version, BAMS, is proceeding well. So we're looking forward to some long legs on this platform with the Navy as well.
David Strauss - UBS Investment Bank: Jim, a question for you. Could you address corporate and on pension? I think on pension [indiscernible] you said $355 million now. I thought that number was $325 million, but I might be wrong. And then on corporate, it was obviously low, but based on your outlook for all-in margins, it looks like that's going to obviously pick up here with the move of headquarters and stuff. And if you could address that and stranded cost and all of that.
James Palmer: Yes. In terms of corporate, I essentially see us ending the year a little bit greater than we ended last year, frankly. Clearly, this year has a bunch of move-related costs that we're going to incur probably more in the third and fourth quarters. And so, you're going to see some lumpiness in this as we go through the year. Some of those costs are going to hit in the third and fourth quarter when moves actually occur. We are planning the move from Century City in August. Some of the people, some of the costs, obviously, is people-related cost, when they move, when they sell their homes. And so those are going to probably be in the third quarter and fourth as well, potentially some in the second quarter. And we're not necessarily always going to have the change in recoverability of state income taxes that occurred in this first quarter. So lumpiness, but I think on a global basis for the year, as I've said, a little bit greater than where we ended last year's in terms of total corporate. Stranded cost, essentially most of those stranded cost get a -- some of them end up at corporate. A big part of them end up as additional cost being pushed to the operating sectors included in their margin rates. So essentially, we're trying to address that, that way. And I forgot what was the other part of your question? Oh, pension. $355 million was our -- has been our guidance for the year, not $325 million. The run rate for the first quarter was a little bit higher than that. On a cash basis, we true up our cash cost late in the year, probably in the third quarter or so when we complete our census data for the beginning of the year. You might imagine this is a lengthy process to look at all of the employee populations and all the census. And so we have original, our initial estimate that's based on census data that's older. And then, we update it to the actual census data, and that takes us into the third quarter normally before we get that finished.
Operator: Our final question will come from the line of Jason Gursky of Citi.
Jason Gursky - Citigroup Inc: Let me start with just a really big picture question on margins, and where you see opportunities and risks to margin rates over the next couple of years, given what you see in your backlog? And then, a little bit more of a specific question on unmanned. You talked a little bit about the Global Hawk or a lot about Global Hawk. Can you talk a little bit about other opportunities that you might see in the future, given the capabilities that you now have built there on unmanned platforms?
Wesley Bush: All right, Jason, this is Wes. Just your first question on where we see both opportunities, and perhaps risks in the operating margin part of our business. This has been an area of substantial focus for us. If you turn the clock back just a couple of years ago, our operating margin rates were below those of our industry peers. If you look at it sort of segment by segment, there were a lot of reasons for that. Some of it was the contracts we had taken on, some of it was program performance. So we've been working this very, very aggressively. We demonstrated, I think, some really good improvements over the last couple of years and have achieved margin rates most recently that are, I think, margin rates we can be very proud of. Does that mean we're stopping, that we're not going to continue to push? No, we want to continue to improve. There are some natural limitations associated with the nature of contracts we can enter into with our customers. But we are being very thoughtful about which contracts, we have structured our incentive system, to ensure that we are aligning the team on -- making sure we're taking on good contracts, contracts that we can execute for our customers. So this is as much about performing for our customers as it is our shareholders. We want to make sure we can perform because when we perform, we generally do well on profitably. And we're going to continue to put upward focus on that. The numbers that we've specified for this year, I think, are good indicators of where we believe sustainable outcomes are. We're of course going to be working hard to do better than that. But that's where we see the sustainable outcome levels. With respect to unmanned, unmanned is an area that's just continuing to blossom in terms of the applications. The early focus had been primarily on fixed-wing and surveillance. That is what we're seeing today with Global Hawk. Obviously, that transitioned for some platforms, not Global Hawk but it transitioned to some platforms for weapons delivery. We're obviously the surveillance part of this mission is going to continue to grow. We have taken a broad view to the application of the technology we developed, primarily this concept of a very open architecture that we're able to transport between different platforms. We've demonstrated this now with a number of platforms, including rotary-wing. We've had the Fire Scout program, and now we're working with the Bell helicopter, the Firebird program. We've taken it over to UCAS, which is truly a transformational opportunity to put a large, unmanned vehicle in a mode of landing on an aircraft carrier, and we succeeded in our first flight on that earlier this year, and that they had several subsequent successful flights. So we see, basically, anything that's been manned in the past has opportunities for unmanned. And unmanned further extends the opportunity space because some of the constraints associated with putting human beings in the aircraft that have limited the mission applications are gone. So we do see a full emerging set of new areas for this class of technology, and we're determined to be leaders in this to continue to stay out in front, and we're investing accordingly. So I hope that provides a framework for your question.
Jason Gursky - Citigroup Inc: Yes, it does. And just lastly if you could just touch on some of the risks, potential risks to the margins.
Wesley Bush: At the risk with the marketplace, to many -- to a very large extent. Obviously, we're going to be very attentive to that, as we move into this. Production rates, could always have some implications in that regard. And just the general market environment in some of our shorter cycle businesses could also focus in that area. In the past, if you'd ask that question I would've had a long list of specific program issues to go through with you. And I think we've made a lot of progress there. We're not perfect. No company ever is. And there are many programs we continue to work hard on. But I think we've made a lot of progress in managing the individual program risks. We have a methodology inside our company for looking at both the risks and opportunities on a program-by-program basis and managing them in accordance with that methodology. I think that has helped us a lot.
Paul Gregory: So, thanks, Jason. And I think with that, we'll conclude the Q&A. And Wes, do you want to make some closing remarks?
Wesley Bush: Yes, I will just wrap up quickly. Just to reiterate a little bit of what I said in my earlier comments, it was a really good start to the year for us, and we're very pleased with our financial results, particularly the continued solid operating performance in our sectors. This is going to continue to be quite a dynamic environment both from a customer side and from an industry side with plenty of challenges. But as we navigate through those challenges, I just want to reinforce, we are absolutely committed to value creation for our shareholders, our customers and our employees. We believe we have a portfolio that is well-positioned to support those value creation objectives. And given that capability, our focus is going to continue to be on performance, on optimizing that portfolio and making sure we are effectively deploying our strong cash generation. So thanks for listening in and participating with us on our call today, and thank you for your continued interest in Northrop Grumman.
Operator: Thank you, sir, and thank you for your participation in today's conference. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter and Year-End Financial Results Conference Call. My name is Michael, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Paul Gregory, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.
Paul Gregory: Thank you, Michael. Welcome and good morning. Today is Northrop Grumman's Fourth Quarter 2010 Conference Call. We provided supplemental information in the form of a PowerPoint presentation that you can access at www.northropgrumman.com. Before we start, please understand that matters discussed on today's call constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Security laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which are detailed in today's press release and our SEC filings and may cause actual company results to differ materially.  During today's call, we'll discuss fourth quarter and full year 2010 results and our guidance for 2011 continuing operations after the anticipated spin-off of Shipbuilding, which pending final board approval we expect to complete this year. In the event of a spin-off, Shipbuilding results will be reported as discontinued operations. And as an independent company, Shipbuilding will have its own capital structure, corporate infrastructure and associated expenses, tax rates and operating practices and policies, all of which could cause their financial outlook and results to be different from any guidance that we would provide for them as an integrated segment of Northrop Grumman. So for these reasons, our 2011 guidance excludes Shipbuilding.  During today's call, we will refer to non-GAAP measures which are defined and reconciled in our earnings release and the supporting materials posted on our website.  On the call today are our CEO and President, Wes Bush; and our Chief Financial Officer, Jim Palmer.  Please go to Slide 3 and at this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Wes.
Wesley Bush: Thanks, Paul. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On our call today, we'll discuss our 2010 highlights and our outlook and priorities for 2011.  We're very pleased with fourth quarter and full year results. Operating income and cash flow were particularly strong and demonstrated substantial performance improvement. We continue to build a track record of strong financial performance while addressing our customers' expectations for affordable, high-quality products and services. We generated these outstanding results while undertaking several strategic initiatives. These include the anticipated Shipbuilding spin-off, the Gulf Coast consolidation, debt restructuring to reduce future interest expense and extend maturities and ongoing streamlining activities across our company, including the efforts related to our corporate office relocation to the Washington D.C. area. We also restructured our incentive compensation plans to drive behaviors that are consistent with our focus on performance and supportive of our customers' affordability and efficiency initiatives. Our fourth quarter earnings per share from continuing operations increased 7% to $1.27, despite a $231 million charge for our debt tender offer. For the year, earnings per share from continuing operations increased 39% to $6.77. Our emphasis on performance improvement is reflected in strong operating results from all our sectors demonstrated by a 90 basis point improvement in segment operating margin rate, lower pension expense in taxes and the favorable impact of our share repurchase program. For both the quarter and the year, higher segment operating income and higher segment operating margin rate drove EPS growth. We view these metrics as key measures of our operational performance, and we showed substantial improvement in the quarter and the year. Cash from operations and free cash flow were outstanding for the quarter and the year. Results for both measures exceeded the upper end of our prior guidance.  Before discretionary pension contributions, net of taxes, 2010 cash from operations totaled $3.1 billion and free cash flow totaled $2.3 billion. For the year, our conversion of net earnings to free cash flow before the after-tax effect of discretionary pension contributions was 111%.  Our strong cash flow, along with the proceeds of the tax sale, allowed us to return a substantial amount of cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. In 2010, we repurchased 19.7 million shares for approximately $1.2 billion. At year-end, approximately $1.8 billion remained on our share repurchase authorization. We also raised our quarterly dividend by 9.3% last May, our seventh consecutive annual increase, and paid shareholders $545 million in dividends in 2010. At year-end, total backlog was more than $64 billion. Fourth quarter new awards totaled $9.2 billion. And for the year, new awards totaled $30 billion. Aerospace Systems ended the year with a total backlog of $21 billion and Shipbuilding backlog at the end of 2010 was $17 billion. Both of these platform businesses ended the year with several large awards pending.  Our shorter cycle businesses, Electronic Systems, Information Systems and Technical Services have stabled to improve backlogs versus year-end 2009. Electronic Systems begins 2011 with a total backlog of more than $10 billion. Information Systems backlog grew by 20% in 2010 to $10.6 billion and continues to be very well positioned to address high-priority missions in C4ISR, cyber security and large complex federal IT systems. And Technical Services begins the year with a backlog of more than $5 billion. These three business also have substantial revenue opportunity under ID/IQ awards which are not reflected in total backlog. Turning to operational highlights in the fourth quarter, in Aerospace, we continue to see strong demand for our manned aircraft and unmanned systems. The F/A-18 continues to have an excellent long-term production opportunities including the multiyear contract the Congress recently approved, the additional production Secretary Gates [Secretary Robert Gates] outlined last month and potential international sales.  The Global Hawk program continues to perform very well and achieved its critical milestone for IOT&E [initial operational test and evaluation] completion, and we expect a full rate production decision this spring. The first Block 40 recently completed envelope expansion flight-testing and is undergoing integration of the first development MP-RTIP [Multi-Platform Radar Technology Insertion Program] sensor for ground and flight-testing. This radar, developed by our Electronic Systems team, demonstrated unprecedented capability in recent test-bed evaluations, meeting or exceeding customer requirements. I would also note that several FMS [Flight Management System] customers are interested in Global Hawk, which could yield savings for the U.S. Air Force and Navy programs by reducing recurring production and support costs. We continue to focus on driving affordability on the air vehicle and sensor cost on Global Hawk.  Also in Aerospace, the Long Endurance Multi-Intelligence Vehicle recently completed its critical design review for the first of three planned airships. LEMV has three major milestones in the next 10 months including Hull Inflation in the spring, first flight this summer and long endurance flight final acceptance just before year's end. LEMV is scheduled to participate in an army joint military utility assessment in an operational environment in early 2012.  And I also wanted to note that the Navy's X-47B, our UCAS-D aircraft, successfully completed its first flight at Edwards Air Force Base last Friday. This is a critical step in the program and moves us closer to meeting the demonstration objectives of a tail-less, fighter-sized unmanned aircraft to safely take off from and land on the deck of a U.S. Navy aircraft carrier. Electronic Systems was awarded a $486 million firm-fixed-price modification to an ID/IQ contract for the procurement of litening pods and related equipment. ES also delivered to the Navy our number 2,000 production Viper laser which provides the jamming energy for a LAIRCM [Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasures] system.  Also during the quarter, Information Systems won a role on the CDC's [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] $5 billion ID/IQ contract to provide information management and technology services. IS also won a role on the new Social Security Administration Information Systems support contract. This is a $2.8 billion, seven-year ID/IQ contract to provide information technology solutions to the Social Security Administration.  At Shipbuilding, performance continues to improve, both revenue and margin performance during the quarter and the year were solid and consistent with the guidance we provided when we announced the Gulf Coast consolidation. Two weeks ago, DDG 110, the William P. Lawrence, successfully completed super trials and is on track for delivery this quarter.  The eighth submarine of the Virginia class, the California, was christened at Newport News. And Shipbuilding received a $480 million fixed-price incentive contract from the U.S. Coast Guard for construction of a fourth National Security Cutter. While the final decision remains subject to board approval, we took several important steps toward completing the anticipated spin-off of Shipbuilding and an amendment to Form-10, scheduled to be filed this week, includes audited, stand-alone Shipbuilding financials for 2010. In Technical Services, we're focused on driving performance by improving the profile of this business portfolio. Our 2009 logistics awards made a significant contribution toward an improved business mix. Our strategy for this sector calls for a greater focus on the integrated logistics and modernization market while deemphasizing lower margin-based sustainment work. As a result, early in 2011, we made a strategic decision to reduce our participation in the Nevada Test Site joint venture. This will impact our 2011 top line by nearly $600 million. But, as we've said in the past, we're not focused on scale as a major value driver for the company. And this decision reflects that perspective. Now I'd like to discuss our 2011 outlook and priorities. We continue to position our businesses to create value in a challenging-budget environment. This means actively shaping our portfolio to better align with the needs of our customers and continually addressing and improving our cost structure, operational execution and productivity. Our highest priorities are building on the performance improvements we delivered in 2010 while continuing to strengthen our culture of performance across our entire organization. These objectives drive our strategy, our decision and our compensation plans. We are proactively responding to budget challenges by streamlining our businesses, reshaping our portfolio and reducing our footprint and cost. A key element of our performance culture has been aligning our cost structure with our customers' affordability and efficiency objectives. Now with respect to our customers' budgets, it's likely that we may operate under a continuing resolution for FY 2011 until at least March 4. The administration is expected to share more details of this proposed FY 2012 budget next week, which would be the first step in a long and dynamic process.  Based on the budget information Secretary Gates provided last month, it appears that in the aggregate, Northrop Grumman programs will be well supported. This reflects our alignment with critical areas of national security investment such as unmanned systems, cyber security, C4ISR and logistics.  In addition, we are well positioned for future long-range strike opportunities and uniquely positioned as a major subcontractor on both the F/A-18 and the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. While we believe we are well aligned with our customers' priorities, clearly we need to be prepared for a continued pressure on the DoD investment accounts as the government searches for ways to reduce deficits. Creating shareholder value in this environment means that we must continue to be absolutely focused on our key priorities, building on our performance improvements, effectively deploying our cash and optimizing our portfolio for the future. Our 2011 guidance reflects these priorities. For 2011, excluding Shipbuilding, we expect stable revenue, sustained, solid performance in segment operating margin, improved total operating margin rates due to the effective management of our pension plan assets and liabilities and continued strong cash generation.  So now, I'll turn the call over to Jim for a more detailed discussion of results and guidance. Jim?
James Palmer: Thanks, Wes, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. My comments this morning are going to focus on our 2010 results and the sector trends that underline our 2011 guidance. But before I begin, I'd like to echo Wes' comments regarding last year's performance. From my view, 2010 was a year of very strong performance, a year in which we challenge our team to significantly step up performance, and they did. Not only did we deliver operating margins, but we converted that income into substantial cash flow as well. And we also worked a number of strategic initiatives that will be important in shaping our company for the future.  Looking ahead, we expect a relatively stable top line in 2011 with both risks and opportunities depending on defense budget outcomes. We are focused on sustaining our substantial performance improvements while continuing to generate robust cash. Slide 4 summarizes our 2011 guidance which excludes Shipbuilding due to its anticipated spin-off. For 2011, we expect sales from the four sectors of approximately $27.5 billion. To put this into perspective, in 2010, if you exclude Shipbuilding sales, sales would have been about $28 billion. Our guidance assumes that the current continuing resolution has resolved and reflects our reduced participation in the Nevada Test Site joint venture which will reduce sales by nearly $600 million. And finally, it also contemplates exiting some small business lines that aren't meeting our return expectations. We expect sales growth in other areas will partially offset the impact of these strategic decisions. Our four businesses are expected to generate a mid-10% segment operating margin rate, and we expect a total operating margin rate of approximately 11%. Earnings from continuing operations are expected to range between $6.40 and $6.60 per share. We expect cash from continuing operations of $2.3 billion to $2.7 billion before discretionary pension contributions, and free cash flow from continuing operations of $1.7 billion to $2 billion before those discretionary pension contributions. Like 2010, we expect that 2011 cash flow will be weighted towards the second half of the year.  Now I'm going to move to Slide 5 which provides more detail on the sectors. Aerospace Systems had a tremendous year in 2010 with a 5% sales increase, a 17% increase in operating income and 120 basis point expansion in margin rate to 11.5%. For 2011, we expect relatively stable Aerospace revenues. We anticipate continued strong demand for our manned, unmanned and restricted program. Strength in these areas is likely to be offset by lower volume for missiles and space programs principally due to the NPOESS [National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System] restructuring. We expect NPOESS to transition to the new Defense Weather Satellite System, reducing 2011 revenues by about $250 million. At year-end, AS backlog was reduced by $1.1 billion for this transition. We expect AS to generate solid margin rate of approximately 11% in 2011.  On a year-over-year basis, Electronic Systems had comparable sales in 2010 and increased full year operating income by approximately 6%. Margin rate for 2010 expanded 80 basis points to 13.4% and looking ahead, we expect ES to have relatively stable top line in 2011. Revenue will have a slower start in the first half of the year due to the fewer deliveries of VIS, our vehicular intercommunication systems, delays in international programs and the anticipated completion of the post-automation program. We expect ES to continue to generate a very healthy operating margin rate of approximately 13%.  Information Systems also generated strong operating income for the year despite slightly lower sales. As we discussed on previous calls, sales trends in IS reflect the results of our more disciplined approach to new business pursuits. Operating income and margin rate for 2010 reflect an improving quality of new business awards, a better business mix and improved performance on existing programs. 2010 operating income increased 21% and IS had a margin rate of 9%, expanded from the prior year by 170 basis points. For 2011, we expect low single-digit revenue growth with a margin rate of approximately 9%. Moving on to Technical Services. 2010 sales rose 16%. Operating income increased 28% and margin rate expanded 60 basis points to 6.4%. 2010 results for Technical Services reflect the positive impact of our major logistic program wins in 2009, which have contributed to sales growth and it improved business mix.  As Wes said in his comments, we are proactively managing our portfolio of businesses. An example of that strategy is our decision to modify our role and participation in the joint venture managing the Nevada Test Site program. Northrop Grumman will no longer have operational control of the joint venture, and we've reduced our ownership stake as well. From an accounting perspective, that means beginning in 2011, we will no longer consolidate the joint venture and its revenues which approached to about $600 million in 2010. Nevada Test Site operating income reflecting our lower ownership percent will continue to be reflected in TS' operating margin. Because of this change, as well as the phase-out of some of the business lines that don't meet our return expectations, we expect sales of approximately $2.5 billion for TS in 2011 with a margin rate improving to approximately 8% from the 6.4% in 2010. So based on all of these sector trends, we expect a total segment operating margin rate in the mid-10% range in 2011 and a total operating margin rate of approximately 11%. Expansion of total OEM includes strong operating performance, a substantial improvement in our net FAS/CAS pension adjustment to approximately $355 million. These positive trends will be partially offset by expenses affected by the Shipbuilding spin-off and the relocation of our corporate office. On Slide 6, I'd like to walk you through how I think about our 2011 earnings per share guidance without Shipbuilding versus our 2010 earnings per share. Beginning with 2010 EPS from continuing operations of $6.77, we exclude Shipbuilding's estimated 2010 EPS contribution of approximately $0.50, which is represented by their 2010 segment operating income of $325 million, adjusted for their net FAS/CAS pension and OPEB expenses, external interest expense and transaction-related expenses, all of it tax-adjusted basis to yield that contribution of about $0.50.  The next two adjustments are for the 2010 unusual one-time items related to the $296 million tax benefit in the second quarter and the $231 million debt tender charge in the fourth quarter. After these adjustments, we have underlined 2010 adjusted earnings per share of $5.78. And since our 2011 guidance is for continuing operations, we believe that this is the best starting point to understand 2011 trends and expectations. The major drivers of the improvement in 2011 earnings per share from continuing operations are the improvement in the net FAS/CAS pension adjustment and lower interest expense. These positives are partially offset by slightly higher income tax rate, assumption of about 34% and other items such as corporate relocation expenses and spin-off related expenses. And as I think you would expect, we are working to minimize those costs and their impact as we go forward. We also expect that they will be partially offset by share repurchases and opportunities for operating improvement as we go through the year. That brings us to an overall range of $6.40 to $6.60 per share. And I should add that this guidance reflects a modest assumption for share repurchases throughout the year.  The net FAS/CAS pension income of $355 million or $0.77 per share from continuing operations reflects last year's strong investment performance, about 12.5% and a 25 basis point reduction in our discount rate of 5.75% from 6% the prior year and other minor changes to our actuarial assumptions.  At year-end, the funded status of our plans was 92% and our mandatory funding contributions or requirements for 2011 is about $60 million. And at this point, we have plans to make discretionary pension contributions of about $500 million in the first half of 2011. So with the positive trends in our operations, the net pension expense improvement, strong cash generation and continued optimization of our portfolio, we remain focused on generating shareholder value. So I think with that introduction, we're ready to turn it over for Q&A.
Paul Gregory: Thanks, Jim. And Michael, I think we're ready to go to the Q&A portion of the call.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Troy Lahr of Stifel, Nicolaus.
Troy Lahr - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I'm just wondering if you can talk a little bit about the businesses and the business lines that you're exiting out of. You mentioned that there were some small businesses. Was that all at Technical Services? And Wes, can you maybe just mention how you think about the portfolio and additional reshaping in the 2011 or is the portfolio getting close to where you want it to be?
Wesley Bush: With respect to the discussion we had on Technical Services, our primary decision there in terms of scale obviously was the decision around the joint venture at the Nevada Test Site. But I will tell you that we've gone through a pretty comprehensive process in Technical Services to look at how we achieve a better business mix with a focus that I would say is more strongly directed towards the modernization and the upgrades part of the Logistics business with a reduced focus on the lower margin sort of base sustainment-type of work. So the Nevada Test Site was the biggest decision, we've made some other smaller decisions in that mix. But it is reflective, I would say, of our thought process that we're using across the company. We've talked a lot about the way we've been thinking about our overall portfolio mix in Information Systems and in particular on the civil side. And I think you saw us over the last year, couple of years actually, make a variety of decisions consistent with the same perspective that we've been applying to TS. Where we really want to focus on the higher quality parts of the business, the places where we have meaningful differentiating capability and where we can generate real value through our participation in those business. Value for both our shareholders and for our customers and for our employees, of course, as well. So I think you should see it more as a trend line of thinking that we've been talking about and the actions that we've already been taking. And going forward, that's a good model for the way we're going to continue to think about our portfolio and the company. We're going to be actively engaged in assessing where we're generating value and where we should perhaps exit or where value might best be generated in the hands of others. And that's a model that I think is serving us well.
Troy Lahr - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: You're actively engaged, is that kind of the services businesses or also the products, I mean everything's on the table or is it mostly service-oriented businesses?
Wesley Bush: With respect to what we were looking at in Technical Services?
Troy Lahr - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: No, kind of going forward, you said you're actively engaged in kind of looking. Is that, just at the service businesses or you're actively kind of looking at the portfolios in Aerospace and Electronics also?
Wesley Bush: We have a continuous process in the company to look at all the elements of the portfolio.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned of Sanford Bernstein.
Douglas Harned - Bernstein Research: On ships, you had some very good margin performance in Q4. And can you talk about what drove those margins? How you would contrast the Newport News and Gulf Coast in this? And is this something that is -- are we getting to a point where there is a sustainably higher margin going forward in ships than we've been seeing?
James Palmer: Doug, the way I would characterize it would be to say that there's always performance adjustments in every quarter. We tried to look at all -- we have a handful as you know of major contracts in Shipbuilding. It allows you to look at them on a regular basis to see whether or not you need to make adjustments. There is every quarter adjustments, upwards or downwards, none of them are individually significant enough to require disclosure. So I would characterize it more as the continuous process of looking at our EACs. I've been public about this. I tend not to look at Shipbuilding margins on a quarter basis. I tend to look at the trends over a longer period of time to see whether or not they are making progress. And as we said in our comments that essentially their performance for the year was better than what we thought they would be after we made the decision and the announcement around the Avondale or the consolidation of our Gulf Coast yard. So they continue to make progress. And as we said, a ways to go, but the positive progress is encouraging. And Mike and his team are really focused on making sure they understand the business, the EACs, the cost, and working to improve their operations.
Douglas Harned - Bernstein Research: And then as you look forward in this year, can you comment on the timing of when you maybe looking at this happening? And how are you thinking about running the business in the interim, if there are any changes? And then I add on to that, when you look at -- can you describe the Navy views on this and potential issues, if there's environmental questions? How are you looking at this whole spin-off as it fits with the customer and with how you're operating Northrop Grumman in this interim period?
Wesley Bush: Doug, it's Wes, let me touch on that. You had several questions I think embedded in there, the first related to timing. So let me just be very clear. Any final decision regarding the separation of Shipbuilding is something that will go through a board process, so it's subject to final board approval. We had said, and I think it was in July so a couple of quarters ago, that it would take several quarters to get through the process. We are on that track. We're working our way through all of the various things that are involved in executing a spin-off. I would say we're making good progress. This week, as I said in my comments, we do expect to file our latest amendment to the Form 10 registration statement. And this one will include pro forma, audited financial data on the back for 2010. So there were just a series of these things you kind of have to work your way through to execute on a spinout and I feel like we're on a very positive track in that regard. I think you had a question in there about the Navy and some of the particular aspects of the structure of the spinout. I would say that we and the Navy share a very common fundamental objective as we're looking at the potential spinout of Shipbuilding. And that is to make certain that we have a healthy company that has the resources it needs, and I would say both the people and the financial resources that it needs so that it can continue to serve its customers very well, and I would just simply say that we've been actively engaged with the Navy in addressing that objective. It's a common shared objective, as I said. Until we get to the point of executing a spinout, Shipbuilding is part of Northrop Grumman. And we're managing it that way and we'd expect to continue on that path. So I'm not sure if I caught all your questions.
Douglas Harned - Bernstein Research: The one other thing I was just curious about which I think relates to your comment on the healthiness of the entity but that is environmental issues with the Avondale exit.
Wesley Bush: I wouldn't get into the details of any particular aspect of all of the components of what we're looking at. I think we've been pretty robust in going through those in the Form 10 that we've been putting forward. I would just say that in each case, I think we've got a good rational approach to managing our way through all of those individual components.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss of UBS.
David Strauss - UBS Investment Bank: Wes, could you talk a little bit about what your guidance incorporates with regard to the fiscal '11 budget outcome? Obviously, it's in tremendous flux right now, potential for a full year continued resolution or something different? Can you just give us a sense for what your guidance reflects?
Wesley Bush: I would just say very simply, our guidance does not contemplate that we're going to have a full year CR. If there were an extended sort of year-long CR, it's just about impossible to predict what would be involved in terms of the decisions that the department may need to make on individual programs. So that's not contemplated in our guidance. We are certainly hopeful that the process is able to get its arms around moving past a CR environment for the defense, but can't obviously predict that outcome. So I appreciate you asking the question because I think we need to provide that clarity that our guidance does not contemplate the full year CR scenario.
David Strauss - UBS Investment Bank: As a follow-up, could you give some perspective on your international business? I know most of it resides in ES, but maybe how large it is today and how did it perform overall in 2010 and the outlook for international? How much do you think it could grow in 2011?
Wesley Bush: Yes, I would categorize it sort of at the top level. And you're right, today, that most of it is in ES. But as we look forward, we see some nice opportunities in both AS and in ES. In AS, just to give you some examples, I would point out the NATO ATS program and more broadly Global Hawk international opportunities that I mentioned in my comments. The E-2 Hawkeye, I think is going to have some nice international opportunities, and Fire Scout, another good example. And then we participate in a substantial way on both F-18 and F-35. So as we look forward, AS has some great opportunities. And ES will continue as well from things like LAIRCM to the whole suite of different radar activities that have been a part of our international business. We expect that that will continue to be a set of opportunities for us going forward. But I would put a little bit of a caveat on that, in that I think we all saw sort of a little bit of a slow down late last year in the pace of some of the international activities. Europe, in particular, obviously had a bit of a slowdown with some of the issues they're dealing with on defense spending when we think about the broader shape of the international marketplace. And obviously we will continue to participate and pursue opportunities in Europe. But I would say our best international opportunities in terms of having an impact on a growth rate are probably going to be more in Asia and some select countries in the Middle East. And so that's where we'll be focusing our efforts. I wouldn't go so far as to give you a prediction on a particular growth rate in international. That's one thing that we've not been doing. We've not been setting some arbitrary target for a growth rate in international. I don't think that's the right way to manage that business when we're driving for value creation not just top line.
David Strauss - UBS Investment Bank: Jim, could you maybe talk about working capital in 2011. It looks like there might be a slight drag? And then any kind of initial thoughts on what FAS/CAS could look like in 2012?
James Palmer: Let me do the second one first. 2012 FAS/CAS, we got to obviously qualify that with a bunch of assumptions. But assuming our 8.5% long-term rate of return, no change in discount rates and then all of that kinds of things, what I would look for in terms of FAS/CAS would be about a $50 million increase in FAS cost in 2012, about $100 million increase in CAS in 2012. And probably about a $75 million increase in funding in 2012 as well. The first part of the question, David, was?
David Strauss - UBS Investment Bank: Working capital in 2011?
James Palmer: If you look at our guidance on cash flow and just go to the midrange of the guidance, it essentially is neutral working capital. So on either end, there's growth in working capital or a reduction in working capital to get to essentially the two ranges of the cash flow guidance.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol of JPMorgan.
Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co: My question is just around the sales in the fourth quarter and then the outlook. It looks like you came up a little bit light in a couple of the segments and three of the segments and overall for the company in the fourth quarter relative to what you guys had been indicating you were looking for in October. I'm wondering if you could just provide some color there? Was that just timing items or was the CR -- does that have an impact? And as you look to your guidance for 2011 for sales, you're looking for the strongest growth in IS. And that's been sort of an area of arguably particular weakness industry-wide. And I'm wondering what gives you the confidence that you're going to grow more there than any of your other three segments?
James Palmer: Joe, I'll take the first part now and have Wes take the second part. I would say sales came in about $100 million less than what I thought it was going to. And our target really impact exactly where it came from. Continuing resolution did have a smaller impact, but it did have an impact. The calendar days also is somewhat of an impact. So I would say little bit lighter than we thought but clearly the continuing resolution had some impact. And then it's hard again to exactly quantify but there were some international awards that we were expecting that just didn't happen in that year and they shifted to the right. So those would be the principal items I would point to.
Wesley Bush: Let me touch on your question about Information Systems, Joe, because I think that's certainly a good question when you look at the overall environment. What I would point to, though, in reflecting back on the question that Troy asked a little bit earlier, we've been through a process of looking very carefully at where we're going to be competing, how we're going to be competing. And so we've actually put some downward pressure on the IS top line over the last couple of years with our decisions to remove ourselves from the state and local IT outsourcing business in terms of new contract awards and in terms of better focusing in the federal agencies part of our business. And I would also say in both the defense and intelligence sides of IS, we've been perhaps more selective than we had in the past on where we're going to pursue some things. So we've actually put some downward pressure over the last couple of years. What it has caused us to do is we have gone out and pursued new contracts. It has caused us to, I would say, not only be more thoughtful but be more focused and reshape the priorities for our investments in those areas. And over the course of the last year, we actually did pretty well in capturing a number of new activities in IS that aligned with these different, if you will, a little bit different objectives. And based on the successes we had last year and the pipeline that we see this year that aligns on those objectives, we believe we have a very good opportunity to see that what I would call modest growth, not substantial growth, modest growth in our IS portfolio this year. So it's very much aligned with what we've been doing and in some respects, the product of what we've been doing to kind of reposition that business. There are a number of elements of that marketplace that do continue to see some substantial priority in their funding streams. Cyber is a good example of that. The C-4 and the ISR elements of that marketplace also continue to get quite a bit of priority. So I think the projection we have is a reasonable projection. Again, it's a fairly modest growth rate, but it is the most compelling part of the growth rate looking across all four of the businesses that we're giving guidance on.
Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co: You have been shutting down or reducing your exposure to some of your lower margin businesses and this Nevada Test Site is the most recent example. It sounds like you have a couple of other things in the works. Could you speak to any metrics in terms of management efficiency or G&A savings, that sort of thing? How much streamlining are you doing of management within the company as you eliminate these perhaps management intensive and very, very low margin sources of revenue?
Wesley Bush: Joe, you got the right model in the way you're describing the question. We not only look at the individual program. But we look at what it takes to support, from an infrastructure perspective, that line of business as we are kind of relooking at our overall business mix. So for competitive reasons and other reasons, I wouldn't go into details on the exact set of metrics that we look at and rates and the rest of that. But that is the framework that we're using that you can look at an individual program and perhaps convince yourself that you're getting a good return on investment but you have to look at it in total when we're thinking about what it costs us from a management infrastructure standpoint and more broadly the overall corporate infrastructure standpoint to operate some of these businesses. And as we are very focused on the affordability, activities across the company, we're doing a lot of work to streamline in every single one of our sectors. And streamlining generally means taking out costs that converts into both people and program costs. And then of course on top of what we've been doing with the sectors, we are, as an integral part of our transition to Washington, working hard to reduce our overall corporate costs. We're using that as an opportunity to streamline our corporate office and drive efficiency in that process. So this is something that we're doing at corporate level, the sector level in each of the business units and then of course at each of the program levels, and the decisions that we're taking about here with respect to Technical Services are a reflection of that decision making process.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo.
Samuel Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Can you talk a little bit about some of the changes that Secretary Gates has outlined with regards to F-35 given that there's a shift from I guess production into development. I'm wondering do you still benefit from any additional dollars into SDD? And then when you think about your content on F-18, do you net out a little bit more, a little bit worse relative to what your expectations would have been over the next few years?
James Palmer: On your question, Sam, on F-35, as I look at Secretary Gates' announcements and expected impact on us, basically, I see our F-35 revenues over the next couple of years relatively flat, maybe up $100 million over between now and 2013. The second question was on F-18 and expectations. I think for F-18, clearly Secretary Gates' announcement additional production quantities is a positive for us. We hadn't anticipated prior to the announcement. So when I look at all the announcements F-18, F-35, they tend to offset each other. As you pointed out, probably a positive margin impact in the near term because of the production nature of the F-18 versus F-35.
Wesley Bush: And Sam, this is Wes, to the extent that your question focused around SDD, obviously we are a substantial partner on the program. And absolutely committed to working with Lockheed and the other partners to make sure we have a very successful SDD program. So we are actively engaged.
Samuel Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: I'd stepped off for a just a quick second, so I'm not sure if this was addressed, but, Wes, you've mentioned in several times trying to focus on businesses with adequate returns and yet when I look at 2011 versus 2010, it looks like it's relatively flattish and flattish margin absent the, I guess, the equity income change in TS. And just when you think about the business over the next several years, what is the return profile that Northrop Grumman x ship should be able to generate?
Wesley Bush: Let me just give you sort of a top-level answer to that and Jim did take us through each of the elements in his remarks earlier. But just from a broad perspective, we made some very good progress last year. As I said in my opening remarks, that the segment operating margin rate level, we moved up by 90 basis points over the course of last year. And I was really pleased to see that progress. We're early in the year obviously for 2011. Our guidance reflects that. But as I also said in my remarks, we're going to continue to drive to build on our success last year in improving our margin rates. So it's still a work in progress. Our guidance reflects kind of a view of where we are, but no letting up on our factor to improve our performance.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel of Jefferies.
Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Wes, one of the things that will affect the successful spin-off of the shipyard, one would think, would be a number of contract closes or completions. And you still have not been able to get the DDG 51 contract done. Could you elaborate not only on that but also discuss how you're dealing with, frankly, the pressures on the top line? I mean if you use one of the example, Global Hawk has had some pressures from the Air Force to lower cost. So could you be a little bit more direct in terms of how you're dealing with these two particular items?
Wesley Bush: Let me just first touch on the Shipbuilding part of it. And I think we mentioned in our last call, and it continues to be the case, that as we're negotiating for these very large ship programs and the reference to DDG that you made also applies to the LPD contracts that are underway. We've been very open, transparent with the Navy about our whole thinking on the Shipbuilding spin-off assessment that we're doing, and where that might take us. As both Paul and Jim mentioned in their opening remarks, when you go through a process like that, you're going to kind of recreate the cost structure of a new business that's going to be stood up. And that cost structure and the whole operating structure of the business gets reflected in the way the contract has to be negotiated. So I would say that the negotiations have been complicated by the spin process and that has been driving the timeline here a little bit. But we've been actively engaged with the Navy on this. I haven't detected any indication that there's any desire to go a different way, that we simply need to work our way through that process with them. So those things kind of go together. The Navy has been proactive in addressing the long lead issues for those contracts to protect their schedules. So I think that's been wise on the part of the Navy to make sure that we're able to maintain the outcomes for the ultimate users of those systems. So I think we're making some progress there. On the question on Global Hawk, we are working very directly and very closely with the Air Force to address the affordability challenge. And we see this is a very healthy thing for Global Hawk. In fact, I give the Air Force and Ash Carter a lot of credit for putting a spotlight on affordability here because they've identified the program as a very important program for the department. And they want to make sure that, broadly, both the industry and the efforts that are undertaking within the department that all add up together to go to overall affordability, that all of those things are getting addressed in an integrated way to make the system continue to be so successful for the war fighter. So I see this as a good thing if we can talk about it as pressures on the top line, but I think it's healthy in terms of continuing to make the system even more affordable in an environment where there is so much intensity around the budget deficits. So there are pressures on the top line, no doubt about it. I mean we're seeing this kind of across the board because our customers are feeling those pressures. And it's what you'd expect in this environment. And we need to be responsive to that. We need to be out in front of it. And the work that we're doing across our company on cost structure, I think it's helping us to be out in front of it. But we need to continue to be good partners with our customers to make sure that together we can get the right capabilities to our war fighters in a way that the nation can afford.
Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Just as a follow-up, there was a $27 million gain it looked like in the quarter. And I know that, my guess is it probably had to do with the Nevada Test Site and there was also a fairly large charge at corporate? Jim, might you just address those two items?
James Palmer: Howard, I wouldn't say a large charge at corporate. But, the Unallowable cost did go up at corporate due to a number of factors such as there was $10 million contribution that we made, for example. Normally at the end of the year, we take a look at all of our costs, make sure that we properly identified the unallowables and so there's some true-up process that goes through there. The other big factor in the increase in the corporate unallowable costs was an increase in deferred state taxes. We mentioned that in the press release. We obviously made a large contribution in the fourth quarter to the pension plan results in a reduction of state taxes payable, allowable state taxes payable. But you have to provide deferred taxes on that contribution. And so in the future, at some point that those will become allowable and will have an offsetting impact then. Essentially, what you saw occurring in the corporate cost in the fourth quarter was the deferred state taxes and the other true-ups of unallowable costs, as well as, as I mentioned, the additional contribution that we made to our charitable trust.
Wesley Bush: And the other income, I think was the first part of your question, that was several factors that contributed to that not [indiscernible]
James Palmer: And in other income there's, as you know, a myriad of things that run through there. For example, the returns on our non-qualified assets or assets used to fund our non-qualified plans versus the deferred compensation expense. It was probably positive this year, an additional $5 million. There's some foreign currency items. It's just a hodgepodge of different things, Howard.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank.
Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank AG: Wes, you talked about the movement incentives this year. And that was probably an enabler to some of the bigger muscle moves. But now that the portfolio is kind of more or less closer to where you want it, would you anticipate moving some of those metrics back towards growth versus efficiency or the metrics you have and the incentives you have essentially the same incentives you'd use for the current portfolio?
Wesley Bush: We're going through a process of finalizing those incentives with our board. But I would tell you that the perspective remains largely the same as last year. We believe there is the best opportunity to create value for our shareholders, our customers and our employees, by focusing on the performance improvements and continuing to work on the portfolio side of these things and of course being intelligent and thoughtful about the way that we are deploying the cash that we're generating. And I think our incentive structure is largely aligned with that. Each year, we look at making some tweaks to it just to continue to best align with the environment and the opportunities that we see. But I like what we've got, I think it's working well for us. So it would seem that we probably want to see more continuity in that than change.
Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank AG: And I guess just a cleanup question from the guidance relative to where the street was looking, if you would include ships in the 2011 guidance, would it have been roughly $0.75 incremental to the range? I know the slide you have says $0.50 for 2010 but that would have included the charge. Just kind of benchmark if there's anything else I'm missing there?
James Palmer: I think the best way to think about it is $0.50 for 2010. We're not providing 2011 guidance for Shipbuilding. And I think your expectation, our expectation was that Shipbuilding was on a slow improvement trend and should have been some improvement in '11. Leave it at that.
Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank AG: And just to clarify, there's no assumption of any proceeds from a potential spin and any transaction dividend that could come from that included in the guidance, is that right?
Wesley Bush: We've not made any decisions with respect to any of those things. And so it would not be appropriate for us to include that in our guidance.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro of Access 342.
George Shapiro - Citi: I just wanted to follow up on that because some of the stuff that's been coming out from the rating agencies have you with a $1.5 billion of debt or 3.5x debt to EBITDA level at ships. I just wanted to kind of get your comment on the rationale for that and maybe a little further color on it.
James Palmer: We're on the early stages, George, of all of this process on standing up Shipbuilding as a standalone entity. Obviously part of that process is to talk to the rating agencies about a range of scenarios. And I think what you're seeing is some of that input there. And as Wes said, we're in the process of making hay right now, I don't think we should comment on exactly where we think that's going to end up because we're not there yet.
George Shapiro - Citi: Wes, in the Nevada Test Site program, several years ago when you won that contract, the thinking was it would make somewhat better margins than it turned out to do which obviously has lead you to take the action you have. So kind of what did you learn from the thinking process that you had when you bid on this program versus where you are now?
Wesley Bush: I would say, George, at the time that we bid it, there was a concern about our scale in the Technical Services arena. And the thought that having that volume in Technical Services would be helpful to the overall capacity of that organization to grow. If you look at the numbers over the years, we've done a great job of growing TS. And as we've gone through that growth cycle, it's been important that we not just rest on assumptions we made in the past but that we continue to relook at how we're actually creating value. And as we've had more and more success on the logistics part of the business, the modernization programs, the sustainment programs, and the business has really grown, I would say substantially, with respect to those program opportunities. It's been important that we continue to reshape the way that that mix looks and make the decisions that -- we walked through a little bit earlier with Joe on what is really driving value. And do we have elements of that mix that are consuming more infrastructure costs than they're really providing in terms of the payback and returns. So it's, I would say, a continuous process, not so much that the thinking at the time was necessarily an error. We were in a different place. And as we have matured that business, we have matured our thinking. And it's a reflection of that evolution of where we see the future opportunities to create value in Technical Services. I really give a lot of credit to our team in Technical Services over the course of this past six months in particular in taking a very aggressive proactive approach to thinking about the value creation in that business. It's always hard on any business when you say maybe we actually get better by getting a little bit smaller on the top line. That's not a natural thing for most businesses to think their way through. And the teams across the company have been very, I would say, forward leaning and thinking about that value creation opportunity. So this isn't just something that's coming from the corporate office with an edict of we got to get out of that business or we got to get out of some other business. It is the product of the team that is really aligning I think quite well around the notion of making sure we're doing the right thing for the long term for our company and our shareholders and customers. And they're bringing forward a lot of these types of concepts to help us do a better job in creating value. So I very much appreciate what our team is doing there.
George Shapiro - Citi: Wes, so if you try to -- you've obviously looked at all your revenues at this point. Could you provide some rough number as to how many dollars might be out there that you think at this point are kind of under-earning or in the same boat of not really fitting with what you want to do at this point?
Wesley Bush: George, I want more out of all of them.
Paul Gregory: We are really -- essentially used up our hour. We do have some management time constraints today. We have more people in the queue. We'll try to go in for a couple of more minutes but we may not be able to get all the way through the queue due to some of these time constraints we have. So let's continue, Michael, with a couple of more questions.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Skibitski of SunTrust.
Peter Skibitski - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Capital Markets: Just wondering, when you talked about your 2011 top line guidance, you mentioned some risks and opportunities. Could you shoot out for us a few of the opportunities there that outperformed?
James Palmer: One of the opportunities is the F-18 with Secretary Gates' recent announcement and it's not clear to me, at least at this point, exactly whether that is a 2011 impact or 2012. That would be an example. And Wes mentioned that some of the opportunities that we see, that we're pursuing on an international basis, my experience frankly is those things take a long time to bring home. But once when you do bring them home, they start immediately. But predicting exactly when they're going to come home is very difficult.
Peter Skibitski - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Capital Markets: Can you just tell us what your net interest assumption is for 2011?
James Palmer: $220 million.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky of Citi.
Jonathan Raviv: It's actually John Raviv here for Jason. Just a question, I think on the third quarter call you mentioned OpEx costs stuck at Northrop parent following the spin. I think you talked about something in the range of $0.20 EPS over 12 to 18 months. I just wonder if you could have an update to that number?
James Palmer: Nothing's really change, John, in my perspective there.
Paul Gregory: I think with that we're going to conclude the call. Wes, you want to say before we...
Wesley Bush: Again, just thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We appreciate your continuing interest in our company. As I said in my prepared remarks, we are very focused on continuing to drive improvements in our performance to make sure that we are actively and effectively managing our portfolio and capabilities. And of course continue to be focused on both our generation of cash and our deployment of cash to create value. Thanks again, everyone.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Northrop Grumman Third Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Jennifer, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Paul Gregory, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.
Paul Gregory: Great. Thank you very much, Jennifer, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's Third Quarter 2010 Conference Call. We provided supplemental information in the form of a PowerPoint presentation that you can access at www.northropgrumman.com. Before we start, please understand that matters discussed on today's call constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Security laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which are detailed in today's press release and our SEC filings and may cause actual company results to differ materially. During today's call, we'll discuss third quarter results and our guidance for 2010. We'll refer to non-GAAP measures, which are defined and reconciled in our earnings release and the supporting materials posted on our website. On the call today are our CEO and President, Wes Bush; and our Chief Financial Officer, Jim Palmer. And with that, we're ready to start. Wes?
Wesley Bush: Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. This morning, I'll discuss our third quarter results, operational highlights and our outlook for the remainder of 2010. We are very pleased with our third quarter results. They demonstrate that across the entire enterprise, our team is focused on driving sustainable performance improvement. Our efforts are generating positive results across our business, which is reflected in this quarter's double-digit EPS growth. Financial highlights for the quarter include 4% sales growth and a 14% increase in segment operating income. Third quarter segment operating margin rate improved 80 basis points to 9.8%, which is the primary indicator of performance improvement at the sectors. Operating income also increased substantially reflecting the operational improvements and lower pension expense. In addition to operational improvements, during the quarter, we repurchased approximately 3 million shares of our common stock, bringing this year's repurchases to 17.8 million shares or approximately $1.1 billion. Based on our performance for the first nine months of the year, we now expect 2010 earnings to range between $6.85 and $7 per share. We also have a strong quarter for cash. Cash from operations before discretionary pension contributions totaled more than $1 billion, and free cash flow, also before discretionary pension contributions, totaled approximately $850 million. Based on year-to-date results and again, before discretionary pension contributions, we continue to expect cash from operations of $2.3 billion to $2.8 billion and free cash flow of $1.5 billion to $2 billion. Through the first nine months, our pension contributions totaled $390 million. Jim will provide more detail on cash and pension trends later in the call. At the end of the third quarter, total backlog was $64.6 billion, which reflects new awards of $7.4 billion in the quarter. The decline in backlog through the end of the third quarter is principally driven by Aerospace and Shipbuilding, our two large primarily platform businesses, where awards are typically large and occur periodically. In Electronics, Information Systems and Technical Services, our shorter-cycle businesses, the backlog trends are generally positive. Several major Aerospace and Shipbuilding awards are pending. And as these awards are finalized in the coming months, we expect an improvement in our book-to-bill rate. A prolonged period of continuing resolution could delay some awards, however. Turning to sector highlights. Aerospace sales increased 7%. Operating income increased more than 14%, and margin rate improved 70 basis points to 11.2%. Sales trends in Aerospace continue to reflect higher volume for manned and unmanned aircraft platforms, which was partially offset by lower sales for missile defense and civil space programs. We achieved several milestones in the Global Hawk program this quarter. In addition to supporting in-theater operations 24 hours a day, seven days a week, Global Hawk recently achieved 35,000 combat hours and two Global Hawks were deployed to new overseas locations. One to Sigonella Naval Air Station in Italy and the other to the Pacific Command at Andersen Air Force Base in Guam. Overall, the system continues to perform very well, and the program is on track for achieving its critical initial operational test and evaluation milestone, which we expect will lead a full rate production decision next spring. Global Hawk affordability continues to be a key priority that we are working jointly with our customer. The air vehicle production costs has continued to decline across each production line. And for the payloads, we are utilizing combined buys and an economic order quantity approach to reduce cost. As platform configurations continue to mature and affordability initiatives are implemented, we expect air vehicle and sensor costs will continue to decline. Driving production efficiencies is an ongoing focus for Aerospace Systems, not only for Global Hawk but for all of our key programs, including the F-35 and the F/A-18. In Electronic Systems, sales rose about 2% for the quarter. Operating income increased 21%, and margin rate expanded more than 200 basis points to 13.9%. During the quarter, Electronic Systems received one of the three contracts for the technology development phase of the Navy's AMDR program, the next-generation radar capability from Maritime Integrated Air and Missile Defense. We also won a very important role on the Air Force's $2.3 billion ID/IQ program to provide new advanced targeting pods along with associated support equipment, spares and product support. Under the Air Force's new two-pod strategy, Northrop Grumman was awarded a 40% share of the program. This award was a tremendous win for the sector. Information Systems sales were comparable to last year. IS operating income increased 13%, and as a percent of sales, improved 100 basis points to 8.9%. IS had some very important competitive wins in the quarter, including a role on the Social Security Administration's $2.8 billion ID/IQ contract for updated IT solutions. And shortly after the end of the quarter, IS was selected by the Centers for Disease Control to compete for task orders to provide information management and technology services under a $5 billion ID/IQ contract. These programs have multibillion-dollar potential over their respective performance periods but as ID/IQ contracts, they are not reflected in backlog until task orders are awarded. I would also note that IS won a $2.6 billion task order for the installation of a campus-wide information technology infrastructure for secure communications and operations at Saint Elizabeths, the Department of Homeland Security's new headquarters. This award has been protested, so there is a stay of performance in effect. Sales at Shipbuilding increased 1%, and operating income totaled 6% of sales. Most of you are aware that we recently filed a Form 10 with the SEC for a potential Shipbuilding spin-off. We continue to weigh a potential separation of Shipbuilding, and as part of that evaluation, we continue to explore a potential sale or spin-off. The Form 10 filing was an initial step toward a potential spin-off of Shipbuilding, but a final decision regarding a separation has not been made. In the meantime, our Shipbuilding team is keenly focused on performance and quality. We continue to work closely with the Navy and the Coast Guard to ensure we are delivering quality ships. In the Technical Services, sales rose 26% during the third quarter. Operating income increased 37%, and margin rate expanded to 6.4%. The substantial sales growth in TS is being paced by the continued ramp up on new logistics programs like KC-10 and the C-20. Before I turn the call over to Jim, I'd like to touch briefly on our customer's affordability initiatives and other changes that we're seeing in the marketplace. Under Secretary, Dr. Ash Carter, has cleared articulated the DoD's plans to drive efficiency and increase affordability with guidelines that include 23 principal actions. The objective is consistent with what the department's leadership has been saying for some time. We don't believe these initiatives are intended to drive down industry profit margins or weaken the industrial base. Of course, the challenge in achieving the department's objectives will be in how the initiatives are implemented. It's clear that future success in our industry will require the ability to demonstrate sustained productivity, efficiency and performance improvement. We also have to keep in mind that we continue to face an unparalleled dynamic range of national security threats. We in industry need to do all that we can to provide the most cost-effective systems and capabilities to our customers. At Northrop Grumman, we are focused on reducing overhead, managing our supply chain, streamlining organizations and processes and increasing productivity so that we can provide our customer with the best value possible. As we've demonstrated with our recent actions, we fully understand the challenges, and we'll continue to make the difficult decisions and take the actions necessary to position our company to create value for all of our stakeholders. As we look ahead to next year, we would expect U.S. defense spending to be flat to low-single digit growth. However, there is more revenue uncertainty today than we've had in the recent past, given the budget pressures the U.S. government faces. And as we've said before, we believe that our greatest value creation opportunity lies in driving sustainable performance improvement, generating cash, deploying it effectively, optimizing our portfolio and effectively managing our balance sheet. We're making progress closing the performance gap with our peers, and we have opportunities for further improvement, especially as we reduce risk on some of our underperforming programs. We are also focused on future execution of a balanced cash deployment strategy that includes returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. So now I'll turn the call over to Jim for a more detailed discussion of the financials and a bit more color on our outlook for the remainder of the year. Jim?
James Palmer: Thanks, Wes, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Let me just reiterate Wes' comments, which was a really, really good quarter, double-digit earnings per share growth and solid cash generation. Earnings per share from continuing operations grew 13%, even with the headwind of last year's $0.23 tax benefit. So adjusting for last year's tax settlement, earnings per share growth was 34%, with segment operating income, lower net pension expense and share buybacks being the principal earnings per share growth drivers. Looking at the sectors through nine months, Aerospace System sales were up about 8%. Their year-to-date sales performance continues to reflect the overall strength of our unmanned and manned aircraft programs like Global Hawk, BAMS, F-35, B-2, EA-18G and Advanced Hawkeye. The positive trends for these programs were partially offset by declines in civil space and missile programs like the James Webb Space Telescope, NPOESS, KEI and ICBM. While we continue to work under the existing NPOESS contract, the DoD and the Department of Commerce will have separate roles going forward. On the DoD side, we expect to be the prime integrating contract for the Defense Weather Satellite System or DWSS. We've been working closely with the Air Force to transition elements of NPOESS to DWSS. And we are beginning to see a decline in year-over-year NPOESS volume as we enter this transition phase. Staffing has recently been scaled back, and the government's plans and funding levels and schedules are still evolving, so we really can't fully quantify future impacts. But we do expect that sales for the balance of the year will reflect a lower spend profile. We believe we have developed a compelling path forward for this effort, but the realization of that path will depend on the release of sufficient fiscal 2011 funding for the program. Aerospace third quarter sales, again, were accompanied by strong operating income. For the quarter, the margin rate expanded to 11.2% and through the nine months, our margin rate has expanded about 110 basis points to 11.3%. Third quarter improvement was primarily driven by improved performance in our manned programs. As a result of the strong performance through nine months, we now expect the margin rate in Aerospace a slightly more than 11% for the year, with sales of about $11 billion. Electronic Systems sales rose approximately 2% for the quarter and through nine months, sales are in line with our guidance of 2% to 4% growth for the year. ES generated a 13.9% margin rate for the quarter, which reflects improved performance in the period for postal automation and self protection systems. The Flats Sequencing System or FSS is the major driver of the postal automation results. FSS performance was stable this quarter, and last year's quarter included some negative team catch-up adjustments on that program. We now have received unconditional acceptance of the first article test for the U.S. Postal Service, with subsequent system acceptances underway. Through the nine months, ES has generated a margin rate of 13.1%, and we expect the 2010 margin rate to be in the high 12% to 13% range. For Information Systems, third quarter sales reflect lower civil volume, consistent with our focus on higher quality opportunities in this marketplace and lower volume for intelligence program, which was more than offset by higher volume in defense programs. Through nine months, Information Systems are essentially flat, and based on year-to-date results, we now expect IS sales to range between $8.5 billion to $8.6 billion for the year. The IS team continues to do a good job in winning new quality business and retiring risk. This is reflected in their improvement in margin rate. Last quarter, we raised IS margin guidance to mid to high 8%. And based on this quarter, it's likely that they will hit 9% for the year. Shipbuilding sales were up slightly this quarter and up nearly 10% through nine months. Growth for the quarter and for the year reflect higher volume for Expeditionary Warfare programs and aircraft carriers. Operating margin rate for the quarter was 6%, which reflects overall lower performance on Expeditionary Warfare programs, which included negotiation and recognition of milestone incentives on the LPD program. I should also point out that the lower performance on expeditionary warfare also includes a reduction on LPD's 23% and 25% margin rate related to our previously announced decision to consolidate our Gulf Coast shipyards. In addition, we also had a negative performance adjustment on the postdelivery work on LHD 8 that impacted this quarter. Based on year-to-date results, we now expect Shipbuilding sales of about $6.5 billion for the year, and our margin rate guidance is unchanged at 4% to 4.5%, reflecting the impact of last year's quarter's decision to consolidate our Gulf Coast facilities. Turning to Technical Services, reported a 26% sales growth, operating income increased 37%, and margin rate expanded 50 basis points to 6.4%. Through nine months, sales were up 20%. Operating income is up 30%. Higher operating income and the rate reflect volume increases as well as a more favorable business mix with logistics representing an increasing share of sales. While we continue to expect a low- to mid-6% range for margin, we expect sales to approach $3.2 billion for the year. The biggest variable in annual sales will be ID/IQ task order levels over the balance of the year. As expected, cash generation accelerated substantially during the quarter. Cash from operations before discretionary pension contributions totaled slightly over $1 billion for the quarter, with free cash flow of approximately $850 million. Through nine months, before discretionary pension contributions, cash from operations totaled $1.4 billion, and free cash flow was just over $1 billion. We plan to accelerate a total of about $500 million of pension contributions into the second half of 2010, including the $60 million that was made in the third quarter. Timing on that $60 million third quarter contribution was driven by the opportunity to reduce PBGC premiums. And for all of 2010, we now expect discretionary contributions of about $830 million for the year. We are also considering the possibility of another sizable discretionary pension contribution in the first part of 2011. The decision to accelerate pension funding reflects the compelling economics of low interest rates, improving investment returns, tax benefits associated with contributions and the opportunity to further reduce funding in our FAS expense obligations going forward. I should remind you that for 2011 FAS pension expense, a 25 basis points change in our discount rate generates about a $75 million change in FAS pension expense, and that a 100 basis point change in our plan investment returns generate a $40 million change in FAS pension expense. Through the end of the third quarter, we estimate that the return on our plan assets was in the range of 9% to 9.5% compared with our 8.5% expected annual rate of return. Regarding the discount rate, the current yield curve in our analysis of our appliance, to just 2011 discount rate in the range of 5% to 5.25% based on September 30 data compared with the 6% that we used for this year. I would also note that while today's historically low interest rates have a negative impact on our future FAS pension expense, they also create a very attractive borrowing opportunity or environment for public companies. And we're currently looking at how we might take advantage of this lower rate environment. So in conclusion, I would, again, add it was a very good, strong quarter. We modestly increased our sales guidance to $34.9 billion, and our new guidance for earnings from continuing operations is $6.85 to $7 per share. Our guidance contemplates a fourth quarter impact of about $0.11 per share for deferred state taxes associated with our planned fourth quarter discretionary pension contributions, as well as higher unallowable costs associated with the exploration of strategic alternatives for the Shipbuilding business. We are comfortable with our outlook for cash from operations and free cash flow guidance, both of which are before discretionary pension contributions. Paul, with that, I think we're ready to turn it over for Q&A.
Paul Gregory: Outstanding. Thank you, Jim. Jennifer, I think we're ready to go to Q&A, and I would remind everyone that if you could limit your questions to one question and a follow on so that we can get to all the questions, that would be much appreciated. So, Jennifer, we're ready to go to Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein. [Wells Fargo Securities]
Samuel Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about margins in terms of, I guess, one-time effects in the improper rate adjustments that might have helped, and really the sustainability, because where I was trying to go with it is that a couple of years ago, you talked about long-term targets for each of the sectors. And it certainly looks like you're approaching, if not at all of those, except for ships. And so from where we are now, where can the margins go in the different sectors?
James Palmer: Sam, we've made good progress towards our margin targets. As you know we, a number of years ago, put out some long-term target objectives. And as you pointed out, we're at or exceeding some of those margin targets. Our emphasis is around sustainability. I do think that there is an opportunity after having demonstrated sustainability to potentially move up. But right now, our focus is on sustainability. In terms of any unusual items in the quarter, I would just simply point out that every quarter, there are earnings adjustments on contracts, both positive and negative. I can't, as I look at the quarter though, I can't really see any major unusual positive adjustments that were included to drive the results one way or another.
Wesley Bush: And, Sam, I would say that, from my perspective, and as Jim indicated, we are very pleased to see the progress that we've been able to make over these last few quarters in improving our margin rates. We're not going to be satisfied until we see this really be demonstrated as sustainable performance improvement quarter-after-quarter, and that's what we're really driving on across the corporation.
Samuel Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: And at the top wherein we're to slow, are there any areas where we might see the margins start to trend the other direction?
James Palmer: We don't see it as particularly connected to the top line. Obviously, we've had to take and are continuing to take a lot of actions around affordability so that we are managing our total cost structure into an environment that we see, as I indicated in my remarks, as flat to very, very low growth. And we continue to press on that overall perspective of affordability and competitiveness. But I don't have any near-term concerns about those translating into pressures on our bottom line.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Heidi Wood. [Morgan Stanley]
Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley: Wes, you've had a number of good wins as you mentioned in civil recently, disease and health and home and security. Can you talk about how you're allocating your discretionary resources now in terms of targeting other areas of Federal government spending? And can you also touch on also with these increased wins in civil, what does this mean for margins going forward?
Wesley Bush: Heidi, in civil, we had been clear for some time that we were reshaping our focus on that part of the portfolio, away from the stable local IT outsourcing environment to be more heavily focused in the civilian agencies area. And then in particular, in the civilian agencies area, in places where we thought we could really bring something that was differentiating for the long term. So the wins that we've announced are reflections of that strategy of being more focused on civilian agencies and then being, I would say, quite selective within the civilian agencies range of opportunities for those areas where we can bring things such as our Cyber Security capabilities to many other solutions or other substantial engineering content that reflects the type of value that we can deliver to customers. So we see that marketplace as an attractive marketplace. Again, we are selective in what we're pursuing. And part of that selection process goes to the second part of your question, which is the margin rate. We are pursuing those opportunities that we believe are consistent with our margin rate objectives that we've laid out for Information Systems in total. And so that typically reflects a little bit of more of the higher end, if you're okay with that description, of the civilian agencies marketplace than the parts of the marketplace that have been more commoditized.
Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley: And, Jim, a question for you. Can you give some color on stock buyback? What are your thoughts there? And would you issue debt to buy back more stock?
James Palmer: Heidi, let's see. Looking back for the year, we've had share repurchases in all three quarters. The rate at the first part of the year was heavier and we tried to deploy the proceeds from the TASC divestiture. And in terms of the market opportunities, the capital markets, we're looking at a range of alternatives, I think it's fair to say at this point. And I don't think I would take anything off the table as far as potential but at this point, it's really looking at what we might be able to do and what is the most attractive to us.
Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley: I didn't catch what you did in the third quarter, Jim, for amount and shares.
James Palmer: We did about 3 million shares, a little bit less than $170 million.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Troy Lahr. [Stifel, Nicolaus]
Troy Lahr - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Wes, I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about your thoughts a little longer term once you get through your plan with Shipbuilding. Do you see any more material changes to the portfolio?
Wesley Bush: Well, the way I would frame that, Troy, is that we have a continuing process in our company to actively manage our portfolio. We continuously look at what we need to add and what we need to subtract to be best to support our customers for the long term and to generate value for our shareholders. So as we look forward, there's a -- and I would just say that there's that sort of continued process that's underway. On the addition side, I've said frequently and we just reinforce that we feel very good about the set of capabilities that we have and their match to where we see our customers going, whether that's in C4ISR or Cyber or unmanned or the logistics part of the business, we do look at opportunities that come up in the marketplace to add to the portfolio. But so far, and I think you've seen in our actions over the last couple of years, we really haven't seen anything that's just been a must have it all. And so we can afford to be very, very disciplined in the way that we assess those market opportunities. But I would just say that we do have a continued proactive process in our company to manage our portfolio.
Troy Lahr - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And is the plant still to resize your executive workforce as you transition headquarters to D.C. or might you to accelerate that? And kind of are you looking at head count reductions at the segment levels with budgets slowing down kind of what Lockheed and Boeing have been doing?
Wesley Bush: We have very proactively addressed the head count question, both at the executive level and the levels below. We have, as you would recall over the last couple of years, taken our sectors from eight down to the five that we have today. And as we have taken each of those moves, we have used those as opportunities to take out substantial cost, which primarily has been focused around head count reduction to get to more optimized and streamlined organizational approaches. We have been a bit of that already at the corporate staff level. And as we relocate, we are shrinking the size of the corporate office as a part of that relocation. But I would say more broadly in the things that perhaps connect even more directly in terms of the affordability initiatives, we've also taken on, enterprise-wide, a variety of activities around Shared Services that are really paying dividends for our company. And we we're going to continue to push on those. But the day-to-day cost leverage, the things that really are driving the outcomes the department is looking for, are really happening at the program level. Program by programs, is where we have to take on the cost affordability challenges and demonstrate that we can, if necessary, re-architect how those programs are being done and in all cases, go and find the cost opportunities that will continue to bring down the cost curve. So I know there's a lot of play, a lot of focus that happens around head count reduction. But I would just point out that it is I think even more important the work is being done at the program levels to drive affordability.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Cai Von Rumohr from Cowen and Company.
Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC: Wes, a follow up on the portfolio question. Clearly, you did some portfolio shaping in IS. But your enterprise value, the EBITDA, is a little under 6 and we just saw people paid well north of 10 per properties. Would you consider selling pieces or maybe an entire sector if it didn't do anything to improve your business, but basically would boost your share price?
James Palmer: Look, I wouldn't want to get ahead of any key decisions that we might make in the future. All I would say is that as we look at the businesses, there are several tests that we apply in thinking about fit for the long term. One, of course, is the value proposition. As you mentioned, whether or not we are the best owners of the business and whether or not it makes the most sense to have that business in our portfolio versus leveraging an opportunity that might exist in the marketplace, we also look at it in the terms of synergy, how well the business is connected into the rest of the operations of our corporation, how well we're able to bring the pieces together to create more by virtue of the elements working together. And as I think we've been pretty explicit about, our exploration of alternatives around Shipbuilding, that's a case where we see a very good quality business with great opportunities for continued margin rate expansion, but a business where we've not been able to demonstrate very substantial synergies to the operations of Shipbuilding with other parts of our company. And that has led us down this path of exploring alternatives to see if there might be a way of enhancing overall value, both for our shareholders and for our customers and employees by having Shipbuilding operate as a separate entity. I think it is indicative of our thought process, and just would illuminate the way that we're looking at our company. But I do get the question sometimes, should the marketplace the actions we've taken on TASC and Shipbuilding as some sort of a signal that we're looking to figure out how to dismantle the company and sell the pieces for more than the whole? No, that is not what we're doing. We're not dismantling the company, but we are intent on being very active managers of our portfolio going forward.
Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC: And then a follow up for Jim on the pension question. Jim, could you give us a little more color on the discount rate won't impact CAS? Where might CAS go or what's going to influence it next year? Secondly, for every $100 million you put discretionary into the pension fund, should we assume you get an $8.5 million benefit or is that different because you're outside the corridor?
James Palmer: Let me take that second piece first. The additional contributions into the plan would earn for financial accounting purposes, the 8.5% going forward into next year for 2011 pension expense. Though, and Cai, in my prepared comments, I talked about the two big variables to FAS or financial accounting expense being the discount rate and the long term rate of return versus the assumed rate of return. The other variable is, as you pointed out, essentially what's going to happen with your CAS cost. In our view of CAS cost for 2011 essentially reflects an increase in those costs of about $250 million to $300 million, consistent with what we thought would happen at the beginning of the year. I really don't see much of a change occurring from that view of increased CAS cost that we had at the beginning of the year as we approach towards the end of 2010 here. I'm looking for about a $250 million to $350 million in CAS cost that will serve to offset some of those potential increases in FAS cost that we referred to.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel from Jefferies.
Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Wes, you paint such a rosy picture of the environment, and yet the facts would sort of say otherwise. I mean, while you won 40% of the targeting pods and I know that at one point you weren't even in the hunt there. Or the contract example for the new radar, that is a fixed price development contract. And the final point is on ships, the new naval DDG 51 still hasn't been signed and we're already in the fiscal '11. So to me, I'm not sure I can totally square the box as to your rosy view of the environment and some of the challenges that, in fact, are making it difficult to earn reasonable returns.
Wesley Bush: Howard, I appreciate being described as having a rosy outlook. I don't know anyone that's described me that way of late. And so perhaps let me give you my kind of a broader view. I know I touched a little bit of this on my commentary, but just a broader view of where we see things going. It is clear to all of us that the budget pressures will certainly be a big factor in setting the top line environment for the DoD and the intelligence community, which represent the vast preponderance of our customer base. I don't think there's any debate out there. It's also clear that affordability and variety of initiatives that are connected to the affordability thrust are going to have some implications for the defense industry. We are very pleased by the engagement that the DoD has had with industry in reaching out and setting a course on affordability. But as I said in my remarks, the key to that is going to be in implementation and how all of that rolls out. I do look forward to that continued engagement with the department to shape it as we go forward, and I would say that we have a team at DoD today that has demonstrated a real connection to the importance of industrial base, both the strength of the industrial base and the future of the industrial base that I personally haven't seen for some time. And I really like that. And so perhaps that comes across as a little bit of a rosy outlook, but it's more intended to reflect my view of the interaction that we have with the department, very positive nature of that interaction. They are tough taskmasters. You've seen them hold us publicly accountable when they don't like the outcomes that they're seeing, but I think it's fair. And I think the message is that we need to be doing what the we need to do. And on the programs like Global Hawk, when we've gone and see them to talk about affordability, we've been able to have the two-way conversation about the things the department needs to do. And they've taken that on board. So I like that part of our environment today. I think it will be healthy for our industry over time to be aligned and supportive of that. But just let me be very clear about how I see all that adding up. We do not expect, and I would say nor are we dependent on significant top line growth to create value. And so many of the changes that we've been driving in the company over the course of this year had been focusing on the areas where we see those value creation opportunities, and that goes to program performance, and we've talked a lot about mitigating risk in the programs where we've had some challenges in the past, driving that risk out, generating a margin rates that we know we can demonstrate by focusing on core program performance and then being very good stewards of the cash that we generate. And our value equation is based largely around that improvement in margin rates, that intelligent deployment of cash and being proactive with our portfolio to make sure that we stay lined up actually a little bit ahead if we can with where our customers is going, and we feel good about how that looks in terms of portfolio. So I can't agree with you more. There are a lot of negative, if you will, issues out there surrounding the outlook of the top line, concerns about how the customers will react to that over time. But I would also tell you that, and you have as much or more experience than I do in this, Howard, that over time, we see our nation respond to the external threat profile. And I don't see that diminishing. In fact, I am increasingly concerned about some of the new aspects of the threat profile that we've all seen emerging over these last couple of years. And I do have confidence that our nation stands up and addresses those, and that doesn't translate to earnings or sales in any particular quarter. But it does drive the way we think about positioning this business for the long term, to be good stewards for both our shareholders and our customers and of course, our employees as well. Probably said a little more than you're asking for there, but I appreciated the opportunity to reflect on the environment.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss from UBS.
David Strauss - UBS Investment Bank: Wes, I'm sure you don't want to go into this too much but could you just give us an update of where you are in terms of evaluating the different strategic alternatives you're looking at in Shipbuilding, when you might come to a conclusion there?
Wesley Bush: Yes, let me say what I can in that regard. As I said in my remarks earlier, we are continuing to explore a whole range of alternatives to sort out first, whether a separation from Northrop Grumman of our Shipbuilding business would actually be beneficial. And then secondly, if that is the case, whether it would be most advantageous to go down the path of a sale or a spin-off. I can't say much about sale process. We manage all of that under tight boundaries of confidentiality and it's just a matter of policy we don't comment on that aspect of our M&A. You did see, I think, hopefully everyone noticed that on October 15, we submitted a Form 10 registration statement to the Securities and Exchange Commission. And that was an important filing because that really gets the process started to provide us an alternative should we elect to go down the path of a spin-off. There's a fair amount of information about our Shipbuilding business in that Form 10 and I would say we were quite proud of being able to pull that together and represent what we see to be a very high quality business in the filing of that Form 10. You asked about timing. When we first started talking about this in July, we indicated at that time we thought the process would take several quarters to come to completion, and we're essentially still on the time line that we talked about back in July.
David Strauss - UBS Investment Bank: And as a follow-up, back on the margin question, I guess following up on what Sam asked, you continued on the call, several times you touched about the opportunities for margin expansion not being dependent on revenue growth. If I look at margins x ships, you're approaching 11% today. Could you kind of frame what kind of upside there might be beyond 11%?
James Palmer: David, it's Jim. I'd essentially go back to our prior comments on our long-term earnings objectives for the different segments. I do, as we said at the second quarter call, if we make the decision to separate the Shipbuilding business, there'll be some stranded cost that we'll have to deal with in the near term that will obviously be somewhat of a margin pressure for a period of time until we are able to implement the actions to take out those costs. But x ships, our view of the individual opportunities within the four remaining businesses is unchanged.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank.
Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank AG: A few quick questions. First one on F-35, like you signing up to the fixed-price incentive contract to the details they disclosed, the 50-50 share and the 120% ceiling. I'm curious where you are in your respective contracts on that and how we should think about what risk you're willing to take, particularly in ES?
James Palmer: Yes, just at a top level, we, obviously, don't get into the details of ongoing negotiations. But we are a good partner, I believe, with Lockheed. You'd have to ask them, and their perspective of that. But I believe we've been a very good partner with Lockheed on this program. I would say they've been a good prime on this program, and part of being a partner is being supportive of the affordability initiatives that are underway. We have to look at each of the three pieces of F-35, sometimes, a little bit differently because there are different risk return characteristics. By the three pieces, I mean, we do work on this program as a subcontractor, Lockheed, in Aerospace Systems, Information Systems and Electronic Systems. And so the approach that we might take while similar in most respects, might be tuned slightly differently given the individual characteristics of those areas. The one thing I would say about FPI and it always goes, of course, to the actual structure of airline geometry and target cost. But in general FPI can be a very good contract if you're in the LRIP phase, particularly after you get past the first view of the LRIPs where you have a very good cost base line, where you have a very comprehensive risk management approach and where you know what you're really producing and how the production lines are supposed to operate. And that's where we are in F-35. We've made tremendous progress on this program. I feel good about the products that we're delivering on F-35. And then, there's always elements of the program that require continued tuning and at the prime level, Lockheed continues to go through their overall test program. And so there is the SDD overlay to this and any of their recurring or the new issues that might occur get addressed through that concurrent SDD approach. But given all of that, I think that there's a reasonable contractual approach to be taken here to support what Lockheed's customer is asking of them. And as a partner, we are focused on supporting that.
Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank AG: When do you think you'd conclude those contracts for LOT 4?
Wesley Bush: I hate to project the conclusion of contract negotiations, because someone might take that as a deadline.
James Palmer: Good result.
Wesley Bush: Better to get the better result, than to meet some deadline. And I think that serves both us and Lockheed well, to let the teams work their way through that.
Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank AG: The comment on taking advantage of the low rate environment. I'm just curious how aggressive would you be at this Raytheon's kind of implementation. Is that more along the lines of what you're thinking drive down payout partials, the notes coming due in 2011 and use the remainder for share repo and potentially pension contributions and is that size roughly right $2 billion or so?
James Palmer: Myles, we're looking at a range of alternatives. It'd be premature for me to announce anything at this point. So let us finalize our thinking on what we might want to do, whether we want to go to the market and how we go to the market, et cetera. But rest assured, that we are looking at what the opportunities are.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned from Sanford Bernstein.
Douglas Harned - Bernstein Research: Going back onto affordability and specifically as it relates to Aero, if you look at we're now going to assess the contracts on LRIP 4 for F-35. Boeing's agreed to multi-year on F-18 that they've described as I think fairly as a little bit more challenging on cost. And then you've got Global Hawk that you've got initiatives underway on costs. If you look down the next two or three years, how do you see the trajectory of margins in Aero? Are you able to come in under these new contracts? Do you expect with cost structures that will allow you to keep the same margins you have today or maybe even improve them?
Wesley Bush: Let me give sort of a top level view, and then ask Jim to provide his perspective as well on this. But what's interesting about our business in Aero is we've worked so hard over these last few years on development programs to get those development programs transitioned into production so that we can do exactly what our customer is asking us to do today, which is manage the cost down over the course of production. And so I would say we've been getting ready for this. We've been preparing to be in an environment where we're focused probably a little bit more in production than development, although we, of course, are going to be out looking to win new development opportunities. But on those particular programs, we are driving on cost as we go through these earlier stages of production so that we can hit the lower targets that's should come with learning curve, both in the work we do and in what we expect of our supply base in going through this. And we are not at all interested in taking profitability down as we go through this. We've been working hard to get to the point in production where we're reducing cost and realizing the profitable returns that should come from the big investments we've made to get us here. So there is a big discussion around costs very appropriately. That's what we expected. That's what we've been working to get to. But we believe we should have good profitability opportunities in the production phase. Production is the lifeblood of our industry. That's where the industry gets its returns, and we're going to be pretty tough about holding to getting those returns because we've made the investment. Jim, anything to add on that?
James Palmer: I guess the only thing I would add, Wes, is just reiterate the lifeblood of the industry is production margins. We do a good job there as others do. Frankly, we've been very successful winning new development as well. And so I think as important as production margins are going forward, Doug, the other variable is going to be the mix of development in production as we continue to look forward. If we continue the trend that we've had of being very successful on new development programs, that could be a little bit of pressure on margins. But it really sets us up for long-term opportunities going forward. So frankly, on a near-term basis, I'd take that drag.
Douglas Harned - Bernstein Research: And related to that, in Aero and in Electronics, can you comment on the percent of production versus development, and where that trend is going? Are we seeing a shift towards production in either of those units?
Wesley Bush: I think in Aero we haven't seen that shift yet. On one hand, we have a number of programs that are making the transition: E-2D for example, Global Hawk. But on the other hand, we have other programs: BAMs, UCAS that are still in that ramping up stage on development as well as others. I don't think we made the transition yet on Aero. On Electronic Systems, probably more production than development there.
Douglas Harned - Bernstein Research: And in the trend though, the trend is...
Wesley Bush: Yes.
James Palmer: Yes, clearly, towards production.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi.
Jason Gursky - Citigroup: Just a quick question for Jim. On the idea that debt is cheap and you could potentially raise some to pre-fund the pension and you mentioned that you may make a big contribution in the first quarter. Clearly, we're trying to model out what pension might be next year. The goal here will be to try to offset any headwinds that you might see on the FAS side?
James Palmer: Not necessarily, Jason. It's much more of taking advantage of our cash flow, continuing our balanced cash deployment strategy that we've articulated and had in place for the last number of years. We do look for, as I said, a balance towards returning cash to shareholders through dividends and repurchases. We've had strong share repurchases this year. We've added to pension funding, and we're looking at how we can manage the balance sheet, as Wes said in his comments, more effectively, as well. And then finally we're looking at any of the opportunities that come along in terms of acquisitions, particularly if they were in areas that meet our areas of emphasis the C4ISR, Cyber, unmanned, logistics areas of emphasis. But I wouldn't signal that we're trying to accomplish anything in particular with the level of pension contributions other than taking advantage of the possibility of increasing pension earnings going forward, the low interest rate environment, clearly, a tax advantage in making contributions today. And so essentially exhilarating future obligations into a period of time when cash is favorable.
Jason Gursky - Citigroup: And this is a follow-up question on the statement that you made earlier about some stranded costs post the Shipbuilding getting spun or sold, how much of a margin pressure do think that is? Like what kind of cost levels are we talking about, and second, how long will they stick around?
James Palmer: I'd say we're probably in the $0.10 at $0.20 range in terms of stranded cost, and my experience just tells us it's probably a year to 18 months to deal with them.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol from JPMorgan.
Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Wes, you mentioned delayed awards and particularly in Aerospace and in Shipbuilding, and I'm wondering A, if you could comment on specifically what are the top two or three that are causing pressure in the backlog? And then secondly on that same topic, what's going on? Is this slower reaction time in the part of the government because of staffing, is this tough negotiations, et cetera?
Wesley Bush: If you have my comment around delayed awards and maybe I wasn't precise enough in making it, related more to the continuing resolution environment that we're in. And it really does impact all of the businesses. The continuing resolution is kind of a tough thing for customers because they have to go through a rather difficult process of figuring out is something really a new award or not a new award? How was it funded or budgeted in prior years? And how does the specific language that was reflected in the CR relate to their individual programs? And so thinking your way all the way through that, even and getting the right approvals within the customer organizations, even if it turns out that you're okay to go out and grant the award, it simply causes delay. And we're kind of seeing it across the board. There's just a whole variety of things where we can see that the customer really, really wants to just get on with it, but they're having to work through those kind of processes. So that was more the intention of my statement. It is related to the continuing resolution environment. And we do have some concerns that, that could be an environment that sticks with us for a while depending on how things go in the election and the Congress' perspectives when it comes back from the election. Not clear when that resolves. So that's a concern.
Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co: That's more of an October issue because the CRs is just the new fiscal year. So I guess this is getting more specifically to the backlog in your two platform segments, Shipbuilding and Aerospace, are they platform-type of awards or specific ship contracts or aircraft projects that have been pushed out --
Wesley Bush: yes, there are some big awards that we are in active negotiations with our customers. Some examples, the F-18 multi-year, we are continuing negotiations with Boeing. We talked earlier about Joint Strike Fighter sort of around the company, three other sectors. And in Shipbuilding, both the Destroyer program and the LPD program, we are in active negotiations, as well. And so those certainly translate into meaningful metrics for driving the overall backlog. But I'd put those more in the category of working our way through them as opposed to substantial externalities like SCR. But we'd love to think it was only on October issue. But I'm worried it is going to be a multi-month problem that is more of an overlay to the overall contracting environment.
Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co: What I'm trying to get at is I know it's four or five you mentioned, are these Ts and Cs tougher pricing negotiations that are holding things up? Boeing took a haircut. Are they trying to pass the haircut along and you're pushing back? Or is this just bureaucratic delays that we've been seeing? Between those two ends of the spectrum, how do you sort of qualify what's going on?
Wesley Bush: I really see it being more in the middle of the spectrum as it is. This is just how we do negotiations. And some are longer and more drawn out than others for a variety of different reasons. But I'm not -- when we're talking about Boeing or Lockheed, you've got two very experienced negotiating teams there that are just going to take a lot to get their way work through it. And as I've said earlier, I'm not about to say anything that would suggest that we're putting a deadline on them because we want to get the right outcomes on negotiations. What I'm seeing at Shipbuilding, Shipbuilding restarting the DDG production line. That's a big deal and getting that right is really important. We're determined to get it right in contract negotiations and we've got an excellent team on the Navy side of this that's determined to get it right for the customer community, and so we're all just going to take the time it needs to get it right.
Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co: And then just as a follow-up, Jim, just to be specific on the fourth quarter impact of some of these items. You mentioned the state taxes and the Shipbuilding alternatives. Where do these show up precisely in your expanded P&L, your Table 5 business results just so we have our numbers with you on an apples-to-apples basis?
James Palmer: It's down in the unallocated corporate stuff.
Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co: And so what's the number?
James Palmer: It's at $0.11.
Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co: $0.11 cents in total?
James Palmer: Yes.
Paul Gregory: We are out of time here, and I know that there are other companies that are going to have their calls pending this morning. So out of respect for them, I think we'll try to end as close to our time as we can here. So I apologize to those left in the queue. I appreciate your interest. Feel free to call and contact me if you have some follow-on questions. And with that, I'd like to pass it over to Wes for some closing remarks.
Wesley Bush: Thank you, Paul. I guess in summary, I would just say, reiterate what I said at the beginning. This was a very strong quarter for our company. We're very pleased to be demonstrating the performance improvements that we do continue to proactively manage our business to make sure that we're creating value for our shareholders, our customers and our employees and as I've said on our prior earnings calls, our number one priority across the entire company will continue to be achieving demonstrating sustainable performance improvement. So thanks again, everyone, really appreciate you joining our call this morning.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Northrop Grumman Second Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Laticia, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host for today, Mr. Paul Gregory, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.
Paul Gregory: Very good. Thank you Laticia. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's Second Quarter 2010 Conference Call. We provided supplemental information in the form of a PowerPoint presentation that you can access at www.northropgrumman.com.  Before we start, please understand that matters discussed on today's call constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which are detailed in today's press release and our SEC filings and may cause actual company results to differ materially.  During today's call, we'll discuss second quarter results and our guidance for 2010. We will refer to non-GAAP measures, which are defined and reconciled in our earnings release and the supporting materials posted on our website.  Our results for the quarter reflect the net benefit of this quarter's $296 million tax settlement and our announced plans to consolidate our Gulf Coast Shipbuilding operations. In addition, results for all periods reported reflect the TASC divestiture, which was completed in December 2009 as discontinued operations.  On the call today are our CEO and President, Wes Bush; and our Chief Financial Officer, Jim Palmer. And with that, I think we're ready to turn the call over to Wes. Wes?
Wesley Bush: All right. Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. This morning, I'll discuss our second quarter results, operational highlights and our outlook for 2010. We're very pleased to report another solid quarter that demonstrates our commitment to delivering sustainable performance improvement across all of our businesses. Sales rose 3%, and our segment operating income increased 14%. Earnings per share of $2.34 includes $0.73 for the net benefit of this quarter's tax settlement and the Shipbuilding consolidation-related charge. Before these items, our second quarter earnings per share increased 42% to $1.61, driven by higher sales, higher segment operating income, lower net pension expense and a reduction in shares outstanding.  Before the consolidation-related charge, all five of our businesses generated higher operating income and a higher margin rate than in the prior-year period. Aerospace, Electronics, Shipbuilding and Technical Services also generated higher sales. The company's second quarter segment operating profit would have totaled 9.9% before the consolidation-related charge, representing underlying margin rate expansion of nearly 200 basis points.  EPS growth also benefited from a lower share count. During the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 6.5 million shares of our common stock, bringing this year's repurchases to 14.8 million shares for approximately $850 million. Based on our performance through the first half of the year, we are increasing our guidance for 2010 earnings to a range of $6.60 to $6.80 per share.  Turning to cash, second quarter cash from operations and free cash flow totaled $619 million and $515 million, respectively. These results included the impact of the $300 million discretionary pension plan contribution we made during the quarter. We're lowering our cash guidance for the year, principally to reflect the anticipated cash impacts of the wind down of ship construction at Avondale. We now expect that cash from operations will range between $2.3 billion and $2.8 billion, and free cash flow will range between $1.5 billion and $2 billion. Guidance for both these metrics is before discretionary pension contributions. Our updated guidance for cash reflects the impact of the consolidation decision and a strengthening of cash flows in the second half of the year, and Jim will provide more detail on cash later in the call.  During the second quarter, we also continued to execute our balanced cash deployment strategy. This included the previously mentioned pension contributions and share repurchases, a new $2 billion share repurchase authorization and a 9.3% increase in our quarterly dividend. Going forward, we remain committed to a balanced cash deployment strategy that calls for investing for the future, managing liabilities and returning cash to shareholders. At the end of the second quarter, we had a total backlog of $66 billion, which reflects new awards of $6.5 billion in the quarter.  Moving on to sector highlights. Aerospace sales increased 6%, operating income increased more than 30% and margin rate improved more than 200 basis points to 11.8%. We also had several notable awards, including a competitive Army award with potential value of up to $517 million to develop up to three Long Endurance Multi-Intelligence Vehicle systems or LEMVs. LEMV is another example of our ability to meet an urgent customer need, with an innovative solution that's flexible and rapidly deployable. This program will leverage our core competencies in unmanned air systems, C4ISR and systems integration. The design allows for plug-and-play sensor payloads and can be readily integrated with the Army's existing ground station command centers.  The LEMV will have the flexibility to operate optionally manned or unmanned, and will provide unprecedented dwell capability over theater. Also in the unmanned domain, Euro Hawk successfully completed its first flight, and we received the DARPA [Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency] award to develop and demonstrate air-to-air refueling of high-altitude unmanned systems. Under the contract, we will modify an existing Global Hawk to access a tanker to fuel another Global Hawk. This is an important step in the evolution of unmanned technology, and our successful demonstration of this capability will further strengthen our strong position in the unmanned domain.  Aerospace Systems was also awarded $260 million for Global Hawk, which continues to make tremendous in-theater contributions to our nation's war fighters. We share our customers' concern regarding costs in the program, and we are working closely with the Air Force to address their affordability constraints. During the quarter, Aerospace also received awards of $200 million for F-35 and $135 million for F/A-18.  Electronic Systems sales rose about 1% for the quarter, operating income increased more than 5% and margin rate expanded more than 50 basis points to 13.3%. An important highlight in the quarter was the successful inaugural flight of the mission systems on F-35. Electronic Systems' new Active Electronically Scanned Array radar performed very well. The F-35 is also equipped with our Electro-Optical Distributed Aperture System, which provides passive missile and aircraft track detection, as well as infrared day and night vision that is projected directly onto the pilot's helmet visor for a fully spherical view around the aircraft. This is the first time the F-35 has flown with mission-enabling sensor systems, including the fire control radar from Electronics and the integrated communications, navigation and identification avionics from Information Systems.  Information Systems sales were slightly lower than last year, but operating income increased 26% and margin rate expanded more than 200 basis points. Backlog at IS increased more than 15% to $10.1 billion, which reflects the completion of the Commonwealth of Virginia's review period for our new agreement on the VITA [Virginia Information Technologies Agency] program. We continue to make solid progress on VITA, and we believe that our risks going forward on the program has been reduced. Another second quarter highlight was being selected as one of four companies to receive contracts in all areas of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency's TASER [Total Application Services for Enterprise Requirements] program. This ID/IQ [indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity] contract with a $1 billion ceiling provides for timely and innovative solutions to critical geospatial intelligence requirements.  Sales at Shipbuilding increased 5%, and as a result of our decision to consolidate future new construction in Mississippi, we recorded a charge of $113 million, which resulted in a $16 million operating loss for the quarter. As I said during our conference call to discuss the strategic actions of Shipbuilding, the consolidation-related charge of Shipbuilding does not reflect performance deterioration on the Gulf Coast. Before the charge, Shipbuilding's second quarter operating income and margin rate totaled $97 million and 5.7%, respectively. And for six months, totaled $203 million or 5.9% of sales. So Shipbuilding was on track to meet or exceed our prior margin rate guidance.  Shipbuilding ended the second quarter with a total backlog of $18.4 billion. During the quarter, we received advanced procurement contracts for the LPD 26, LHA 7 and DDG 114. We were also awarded a contract for additional effort on CVN 78. Together, these Navy contracts totaled more than $600 million.  At Technical Services, sales rose 14% during the second quarter, operating income increased 21% and margin rate expanded to 6.5%. The solid sales growth in TS is being paced by the continued ramp up on logistics programs such as the KC-10 and C-20, which are key contracts we were awarded last year. Shortly after the close of the quarter, the State Department awarded Technical Services a five-year $150 million ID/IQ contract to continue to support to the African Contingency Operations Training and Assistance [ACOTA] program.  While we continue to have solid new business opportunities across the company, both we and our customers recognize that we face a challenging environment going forward due to the economic environment and the federal budget deficit. We fully support the efficiency and affordability initiatives that OSD leadership is bringing forward. We also appreciate the opportunity that industry is being given to participate in the definition of these initiatives.  The 2011 budget is still evolving. There is a high probability that we may have to operate under continuing resolution for some period of time before the budget is finalized. Both the House and Senate Authorization committees have proposed reductions and modifications to the President's budget, and convergence is likely to take some time. To date, our programs have generally been well supported, and we expect that to continue to be the case. However, an expanded continuing resolution would impact the timing of awards and delay new starts.  While not an entirely new situation, clearly the fiscal environment going forward will be challenging, and the competition for funding even more intense. We've been proactively positioning Northrop Grumman to compete and succeed in this environment, and we remain keenly focused on driving continuous, sustainable performance improvement and efficiency throughout the organization. Our actions over the last few years to consolidate eight sectors into five have been important steps in this direction. The move of our corporate office to the Washington D.C. area will also provide an opportunity to reduce costs.  And our recent Shipbuilding announcement was another important step. The decision to consolidate future new ship construction in Mississippi was difficult, but necessary to ensure long-term improvement in Gulf Coast program performance, cost competitiveness and quality. This decision was also aimed at aligning our capacity with future Navy plans and improving future efficiency and affordability.  I know that many of you are very interested in our process for exploring strategic alternatives for Shipbuilding. As I indicated in our call a couple of weeks ago, our primary focus will be on a spin-off to shareholders, but we also will assess a sale. We are just at the beginning of this process and until we announce our final decision, we don't plan any further comment on this process.  So now I'll turn the call over to Jim for a more detailed discussion of the financials and more color on our outlook for the remainder of the year. Jim?
James Palmer: Thanks, Wes, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. During my comments, I'll provide additional detail on sector results, cash performance and our guidance for the year. I just want to reiterate that it was another good solid quarter. As Wes said, excluding the net benefit of $0.73 from the IRS settlement and the consolidation-related charge, underlying EPS growth was 42%. Operating margin coupled with higher sales, lower net pension and a reduction in the share count was the biggest growth driver.  Sales increased 3% and even with the consolidation charge, segment operating income increased by 14% and total operating income increased by 17%. Through the first six months, segment operating income was up 10%, and total operating income has increased by 20%. These positive trends largely reflect improved operational results as well as lower net pension expense, but partially offset by higher corporate unallocated expenses due to the $64 million favorable legal adjustment in last year's second quarter results.  Now let's turn to the sectors for a little bit of discussion. Through the first six months, Aerospace Systems sales are up approximately 8%. Aerospace sales performance continues to reflect the overall strength of our unmanned and manned aircraft programs like Global Hawk, BAMS, F-35, B-2 and the EA-18G, as well as some restrictive work. The positive trends for these programs were partially offset by the KEI cancellation and lower volume for our ICBM program.  You'll recall that last quarter, we mentioned that the NPOESS program is being restructured. We continue to work with the Air Force and NOAA [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration] on a path forward for this program. We now expect some resolution during the second half of the year. So while the restructuring has not affected results through the second quarter, it could impact the second half results.  Aerospace second quarter sales were again accompanied by a very strong operating income. For the quarter, margin rate expanded to 11.8%, and through the first six months, margin rate has expanded by about 140 basis points to 11.4%. The improvement in second quarter results reflects improved program performance across a variety of programs, especially in manned aircraft platforms where we increased our margin rates on several programs due to risk retirement. As a result of the strong performance through six months, we now expect the margin rate in Aerospace of approximately 11% for the year while sales growth of about 5%, depending on the outcome and the timing of the NPOESS restructuring.  Electronic Systems' sales were slightly higher for the quarter and through the first six months, sales were in line with our guidance at 2% to 4% growth. ES generated a 13.3% margin rate for the quarter, which reflects improved program performance in targeting systems programs and land and self protection systems. These performance improvements were partially offset by lower performance for postal automation. Through six months, ES generated a margin rate of 12.7% comparable with last year and consistent with our guidance for the year of mid to high 12%.  For Information Systems, second quarter sales continue to reflect the planned declines in civil revenues as well as a slight decline in volume for intelligence programs. These areas were partially offset by higher volume in our Defense programs. The second quarter trend for intelligence principally reflects lower volume for the Counter-Narcoterrorism program and the loss of the GPS OCX program. Through six months, Information Systems' sales are down about 1%, and I would speculate that there's some risk through our 2010 sales guidance of 2% to 4% growth due principally to delayed awards and the potential impact from an extended continuing resolution that Wes mentioned in his comments.  I would also note that in the second quarter, operating income included risk retirement related to a subcontractor on our New York City Wireless program. Some of you may recall that in the third quarter of 2008, we took a charge on this program, part of which related to subcontractor risk that has now been retired, resulting in $18 million being reflected in this quarter's operating income. Excluding this item, IS had an operating margin rate of 8.8% for both the quarter and for the six months, which is a little bit better than our mid-8% guidance for the year and represents good solid performance improvement over 2009.  Shipbuilding sales increased 5%, reflecting higher volume for aircraft carrier, submarine and expeditionary warfare programs. The increase in estimates to complete the LPDs 23 and 25 through a consolidation decision resulted in about $115 million reduction in sales for the quarter. Operating income reflects the impact of the consolidation-related charge, and I would reiterate Wes' comments that excluding that decision to consolidate Gulf Coast construction, Shipbuilding was on track to meet or beat our guidance of 5% to 6% margin rate for the year. As a result of the consolidation decision, we now expect an operating margin rate of 4% to 4.5% for Shipbuilding on a sales base of about $6.3 billion for the year.  Technical Services had a 14% sales growth, with an operating income increasing by 21% to 6.5%. Through six months, sales were up about 17%, operating income is up 26%. Higher operating income and rate reflect the volume increases as well as a more favorable business mix, with logistics representing an increasing share of sales this year versus last. While we continue to expect a low- to mid-6% margin rate, we now expect low double-digit sales growth with frankly the biggest variable being ID/IQ task order levels over the balance of the year.  Turning to cash, operations generated $619 million, and free cash flow totaled $515 million. And during the quarter, we made discretionary pension contributions of $300 million. So before this contribution and recognizing the tax benefit of those contributions, operations generated $895 million and free cash flow would have been $791 million.  As many of you know, the first half of our year is typically lower than the second half. In addition to those seasonality impacts this year, we did experienced some working capital growth during the first half of the year, driven by higher sales volume and less efficient collections in some areas. In addition, last year's first half cash flow results included about $100 million for discontinued operations, principally related to the TASC operations.  So we now expect cash from operations of $2.5 billion to $2.8 billion for the year, and free cash flow of $1.5 billion to $2 billion. This range is before the impact of discretionary pension contributions, and the modest adjustment to our cash flow guidance principally reflects impact of the Shipbuilding consolidation decision. It really doesn't reflect any fundamental change to our operating performance or our underlying cash generation.  At this point, let me also briefly comment on our outlook for pension expense. The sensitivities that we've talked about in the past that I provided for changes in discount rate and variance around our expected investment performance are unchanged from what we talked about at the beginning of the year. Just to reiterate that, holding all assumptions constant, 100 basis-point variance to our 2010 expected rate of return of 8.5% is about a $40 million change in 2011 FAS expense. And a 25 basis-point change in the year end discount rate assumption for our liabilities, which was 6% for 2010, will generate about a $75 million change in our 2011 as pension expense.  As I think all of you know, our plan assets are mark-to-market at the end of the year, and we will really not know what our FAS/CAS pension adjustment will be for 2011 until the end of the year. I should also comment that through the end of the second quarter, client investment returns were positive, it's about 2%, and they have improved with the market during July.  So in conclusion, results for the first half of the year support an outlook for continued operational improvement. We've modestly increased our sales guidance to $34.8 billion, and our new guidance for earnings from continuing operations is $6.60 to $6.80 per share. Our outlook for cash calls for a strong second half that will be reduced principally by the strategic actions we are taking at Shipbuilding.  Paul, I think with that, we're ready to begin our Q&A session.
Paul Gregory: Outstanding. Thank you, Jim. So Laticia, I think we're ready to go to Q&A, and I would remind everybody to try to limit your questions to one if you could and let's go ahead and start.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of David Strauss of UBS.
David Strauss - UBS Investment Bank: Wes, with the potential spin out or sale of ships, how does it change the value proposition as you think about Northrop? You've talked about execution being a big part of the value proposition. Just how does it change as you think about the potential spin off of ships?
Wesley Bush: Well, I think that if anything, it reinforces that value proposition. As I've said a number of times of late, we are very focused on driving sustainable performance improvement in all of our businesses. We continue to see some upside in the margin generation potential of those businesses. We continue to see strong cash generation, and I believe our approach to deploying that cash over time has demonstrated a focus on our shareholders and will continue to enable us to generate value from those deployment decisions. So I don't see any fundamental change as a result of that decision with respect to the way we're driving the business and the objectives we're trying to achieve.
David Strauss - UBS Investment Bank: And then on F-35, with Lockheed talking about potentially taking a fixed-price incentive contract for LRIP Lot 4, how would that potentially impact you as the major subcontractor on that program?
Wesley Bush: We're going to look at that on each of the individual areas where we are a subcontractor. It spans across three of our sectors. We provide support, subcontract support to Lockheed from Aerospace, Electronics and Information Systems. We will, in each of those sectors, look out where we are in the production cycle in terms of our cost confidence, where we are in terms of the learning curves, if you will. And work that through with Lockheed to see what makes the most sense. One of the things that I think is important to continue to emphasize is, generally, when we're well into production, our company has done quite well on fixed price work, where we're generally positive about a view of fixed price work in production. The question is at what point do you move into that as we go through these early stages on LRIP. And it's always a little bit different from subcontract to subcontract. So we're going to manage that on a case-by-case basis.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo Securities.
Samuel Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Wes, can you talk a little bit about your views towards capital allocation? We've, I guess, know about the ship side. We have been thinking, I guess, that the share buyback pace would slow is what you've said in the past after you redeployed the TASC proceeds, and yet it stayed relatively high. Can you just talk about your view towards share repurchase and other capital allocation as we go forward?
Wesley Bush: I think what we were trying to do when we got through the TASC, the use of the net tax proceeds from TASC, was to make it clear that we've been on a rate of share of repurchase through that time frame to meet our commitment to use those shares, use those proceeds in that way for repurchase. We continue to look at share repurchase as a very good use of cash in the company. And as you note, Sam, we've continued to buy back. We do modulate the rate of repurchase based on the share price that we see in the marketplace, and we make decisions on what that rate looks like each time we enter into a share repurchase program. And so with the overall marketplace being down a bit over the last few months, that has increased the rate at which we have repurchased. But I would say as we go forward, we continue to see share repurchase as a very good use of our cash. You probably noticed that we announced a new authorization, a $2 billion authorization that our board recently approved. And that should be taken as a signal that we'll continue to see share repurchases at good approach.
James Palmer: If I might, I would just add that in addition to returning cash to shareholders, our approach towards a balance cash deployment continues, whether it's managing the liabilities or investing in the business through capital or through potential acquisitions. So really no change, Sam, to any of our approach here. Steady as it goes.
Samuel Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: When I look at your free cash flow for the year, is there anyway I should think about how that cash will be deployed? Obviously, dividends, we can calculate relatively easily but in terms of just stock purchases in the second half?
James Palmer: As you know, Sam, we don't give that kind of guidance.
Wesley Bush: Sam, to Jim's earlier point, when we do think about managing the liabilities, obviously, pension is a part of our thinking. And I think we've been pretty clear that we look at that carefully to make sure that we're doing the right thing for the long term with our pension plans as well. So I would just add that to the thought process.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned of Sanford Bernstein.
Douglas Harned - Bernstein Research: I'd like to understand a little more about what's going on in the Information Systems. I know your backlog is up a lot. Wes, you mentioned the VITA contract. And then Jim, you referred to the margin, both the margin levels now and also the potential for slightly lower sales than you expected over the course of the year. Could you describe all those moving parts in a little more detail?
James Palmer: Sure. On the sales side, what I tried to say was that given the very likely continuing resolution, there could have an impact on the sales cycle at IS. As you know, the sales cycle there is shorter than in many of our other businesses. And so a continuing resolution that could delay the start of new programs could have an impact on awards, and therefore, sales for this year. In terms of margin, I just tried to point out that the margin rates for this quarter were very strong, reflecting not only good performance, but also the resolution of the subcontractor issue that we took a charge for in the third quarter of 2008. That was $18 million favorable for the quarter, and that reduced margin rates for -- if you take that out, that would reduce margin rates in IS down to about 8.8% consistent with where we were for the six months period and basically, a little bit better than our guidance for the year. So what I really see out of that Information Systems' guys this year is good. Strong performance in managing their business, and then we have the sales cycle issue that we talked about.
Douglas Harned - Bernstein Research: But is the VITA contract the source of the added backlog? And also, if you had the reduction in sales, can that actually help margin for the year?
James Palmer: Depending on which programs that it comes from, yes, it could. Hard to speculate at this point, and you're correct that a big part of the backlog increase was VITA related.
Wesley Bush: Doug, the other thing I would say about the backlog and IS is that actually we're seeing it increasingly in some of the other businesses, more and more contracts are moving over to the ID/IQ construct. And as you know, the way we approach that, we don't book the full potential value of an ID/IQ contract. We just look at it as the orders come in, and IS is a business that has a fair fraction of its overall business that derives from ID/IQ.
Douglas Harned - Bernstein Research: And your ID/IQ piece is growing as well separately?
James Palmer: Yes. ID/IQ revenues are clearly growing.
Wesley Bush: Yes.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel of Northrop Grumman (sic) [Jefferies & Company].
Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Wes, you've done a number of things that have broken the mold. And so part of what we would expect is improved profitability for the entire enterprise. You've sort of talked about it, and that's the other part of the value creation. Where do you think you can take the profitability of the company?
Wesley Bush: Howard, as we talked a little bit about over the last number of quarters, we're really focusing on that on a business-by-business basis. We do a lot of thoughtful benchmarking in the marketplace. We look at where we believe we can drive additional efficiencies and how we can better approach our contracting. And I would go back to what we've been talking about as the way we see each of the businesses: Aerospace around 11% as we continue to drive forward; ES in the 13% range; IS in the 9% range; Shipbuilding in the 9%, 10% range; and Technical Services pushing that up to around 7%. So every single one of our businesses is driving hard to achieve those levels in the near-term, and over time, obviously, we'd like to see ourselves at the top end of the market space and even move beyond that. But in the near term, those are the things that we're really driving on.
Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: I think I agree with you, but those are sort of what I'd expect, and I mean, I realized they're a lot harder for you to do than for me to put in the numbers. But Northrop, given your mix of contracts, has typically balanced risk a little differently, and in order to take those levels up to higher sustainable margins, do you need contract term changes? Do you need the government to accept different ways of doing business so that this can happen? And is there anything, I mean, other than what you've done already which is nice, is there something else we can point to, to get to this new sustainable level?
Wesley Bush: I think an important part of it is a reflection of the state of the business. The last few years, we've been quite successful in capturing a number of major development activities, and generally, when you're in the development phase, your margin rate opportunity is a little bit lower. As we move into the production, Aerospace has a large number of examples of that, whether it's joint strike fighter, whether it's the E-2 program, the continuing production work on Global Hawk and the variety of unmanned systems. As we move into production, those are better opportunities. Clearly, we have to perform. We have to deliver on those improved opportunities, but those represent really good examples of the types of things that we see as driving ourselves in the right direction. The other thing that we've been doing obviously is working on the portfolio in Information Systems. We have been working hard to de-tune the parts of the portfolio that really don't represent great margin opportunities, state and local. IT outsourcing is a good example that. We're continuing to look at that throughout the portfolio. And obviously, we make some bigger announcements, but there are a lot of smaller things that we're doing that I would say we're not quite as public about that are better tuning the businesses to the way that they're pursuing new captures, with a stronger focus around profitability. We are walking away from things that might give us a nice run on the top line but really don't achieve what we're trying to do from a profitability perspective. And that's just a part of the mindset that we're taking as we're looking at improving the overall performance of the company.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Heidi Wood of Morgan Stanley.
Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley: We, this decision to divesting ships, it's really a huge inflection point in the history of the company. When we go back to when ships were acquired, the idea was to be a higher-order integrator of the service systems as systems of perspective, and there was the highlight at the time on the benefits of being a prime. So how do we think about what the new vision is that replaces it? What are you telling your people on the inside? Is it to be a preeminent C4ISR player, preeminent defense electronics leader? I appreciate your focus on execution, and that's terrific, but that's tactical. What's division as we think about it from the top?
Wesley Bush: We have talked about the areas of focus for the company, being C4ISR, cybersecurity, our manned and unmanned programs, as well as logistics. And that really is a product of going through our view of the marketplace where we see the opportunities in terms of where our customers are focused, but also to your point earlier about how we have been thinking about shipbuilding. Where we see opportunities to create value by bringing the different pieces of the company together to create offerings to our customer and to create levels of performance that we wouldn't be able to achieve with just individual business units, so when we thought about where the market's going, where those opportunities are to really bring the pieces of the company together, that's led us to a view of where to focus that I think we've been pretty public about. It led us to a view that shipbuilding really did not represent a high degree of synergy with the other parts of the company in addressing those bases, and that most likely, we could generate a higher degree of value by separating the pieces so that they can each focus on the areas where they see their best future opportunities. So across the company, that really is the message. That's where the focus is, but I would say, whether you want to call it tactical or not, the key message that goes with it is we're looking for good business.
Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley: How does new co Northrop x ship stock up in terms of percentage of sales when you go across Navy, Marine Corps, Army and Air Force?
Wesley Bush: I don't think we have that percentage broken out for a discussion yet. As we get into the next steps and looking at what the actual separation mechanism we'll use, I think we'll get a little more clear about that. But the one thing I would say is that the Navy will continue to be a very important customer for Northrop Grumman post the separation of Shipbuilding. We do a lot of really important work for the Navy across all of the other four sectors, whether it's the unmanned work we do in Aerospace, the sensor work that we do in Electronics, the command and control and cyber work that we're doing in Information Systems, and of course, a lot of the work that we're doing in Technical Services. So the Navy will continue to be a very, very important customer to Northrop Grumman.
Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley: Because when you think of the -- you have less than 10% of sales in Army, and then you're divesting out of some of the Navy, I thought it would make you somewhat more reliant on Air Force, but it sounds like, Wes, you still feel you're going to be reasonably stacked across between Navy and Air Force?
Wesley Bush: Navy, Air Force, and Army is an important part of our business and increasingly so as we look at opportunities to bring a lot of the capabilities that we have in Electronics and in Information Systems. The Army and then earlier in my comments, I mentioned LEMDE, the work that we're doing for the Army as well. So we see all the services as very, very important, and of course, the intelligence community continues to be an important part of our customer base as well going forward.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank.
Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank AG: Was wondering if you could walk through the Aerospace Systems margins a bit, and apologize jumped in a little bit late, but did you mention any positive adjustments taken in the quarter? I know you're reserving some conservatism for the NPOESS outcome, but just wondering what the real underlying margin rate is there?
James Palmer: Myles, this is Jim. We had strong margin rates in many of our manned aircraft programs, so there were some earnings adjustments positive in the quarter. They were at a rate greater than what we had in the past, if you will, so that contributed to margin rate for the quarter.
Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank AG: So that the level of conservatism that you're holding back for NPOESS in the back half of the year. I mean, is that still the only downside to the back half of the year?
James Palmer: If you will, the conservatism is probably more on the sales side and the margins that then come with it. So essentially what I said is through the first half of the year, NPOESS has not -- the potential restructuring of the program has not impacted revenues or margins, but we do expect the restructuring to occur in the second half, and there could be some impact to the second half margins and sales associated with NPOESS. I would also point out that in Aerospace, we raised our guidance for the year to 11% from the mid-10% range, reflecting the strong performance to date, as well as the expectation for the balance of the year.
Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank AG: And then the only other one on Aerospace with respect to EMARS, what is your expectation for the schedule there, and also, are there other programs you can point to in terms of opportunities over the near term?
Wesley Bush: Yes, Myles, this is Wes. On EMARS, you know what, I've been careful not to get into the business of projecting award dates as there are so many different factors. We do know that the Army is focused on EMARS. It's a very important program, and we do see that most likely working its way to an award some time in the fall. So that's the schedule that I've been giving, one is working hard to support. Now we have a broad variety of opportunities across the company that we're addressing. If you look at the world of unmanned is a good example, continues to evolve. We see both increasing demands domestically and internationally. The unmanned programs are gaining broader attention and I think do represent some meaningful opportunities as we go forward. When I look at Electronics and the work that's being done to address a variety of new applications for the sensors that we have in Electronics, I think there are some very, very good opportunities, again, both domestically and internationally that we're seeing there on the radar side, as we continue to expand our focus on radars beyond, I would say, our more traditional airborne radar position to the work that we do on the ground and eventually over time for the Navy. The IRCM programs continue to get good support, and I think there's going to be good opportunities for that as well. Cyber is another area where we talked about the continued push to make sure that not only are the new cyber-specific programs put in place and getting underway, but also the application of cyber to other new program starts where cyber becomes an embedded part or an enabling part of those acquisitions. So we're seeing good opportunities, a good solid pipeline of business across our businesses. The one caveat I would put to that is what I indicated in my other commentary that a continuing resolution would likely dampen the rate at which awards could be made and certainly would impact the ability of our customers to get new starts put in place, just given the rules that go with operating in SCR environment. So we're being a little bit cautious in terms of sounding too optimistic from that perspective. That being said, we see a robust pipeline across all of our businesses.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Campbell of Barclays Capital.
Joseph Campbell - Barclays Capital: I have a series of questions about the headquarters move, and I'll just rattle them off and then let you speak generally. Will the new Northrop headquarters look, feel and be different from the one that, say, Ron [Dr. Ronald Sugar] had or is it going to be just a few thousand miles closer to the customer? Are there any challenges or risks to highlight? Is somebody in charge of all of this or is it just sort of free flow kind of dates for starting and stopping? Is there a headquarter shrink so that you'll be leaving with less or are you leaving some functions in California that will make this hard to kind of understand? Are the people that you want to move accepting and then what rate and are people turning you down and causing difficulties? And how many people are you kind of getting rid of and not offering a job in the headquarters? So you don't have to answer them all, just kind of a sense of what it really is and how's it going and any numbers would be helpful.
Wesley Bush: Sure, Joe. it's Wes, and I appreciate the question because it is important. It's not a big part of our company, if you will. Our headquarters operations, a few hundred people out of the 120,000 employees we have in our company. So I don't want to overemphasize the importance of the move, but it is important. It's important from a lot of perspectives. One, it is important in terms of what we really want to be doing in driving the intimacy with our customers. And sometimes, I think that's misunderstood as, let's see, Wes wants to be in Washington or Jim wants to be Washington, but it really is about having our headquarters team more deeply immersed in total in our customer environment and being able to make better decisions and support our customers in an enhanced way as we go forward. And I would say that was really the primary focus as we thought about relocating. But to your point, it is an important opportunity for us to resize our corporate office. We are doing that. We've not been public about any numbers, and I won't go into that in great detail other than to say we are using this as an opportunity to address our broader affordability initiatives across the company. We've asked that of each of our sectors. This work, the hard work that's been done and the consolidation of our sectors has enabled us to take cost out of our overhead structures and how we're managing those sectors and the operating costs as well, and we should have that same expectation for our headquarters team. And so we're using this move to drive cost out as we do it. And of course, we're managing it like a program. We have a schedule and a whole set of milestones that we're using to get us in place. The target date for doing that is to have the team in place and operating over the course of next summer. Of course, we've targeted the summer as the best time for move for the families that would be moving. We do expect that we will be hiring here in D.C., yet, it's always difficult to get everyone to move, particularly when the headquarters has been in the location where it is for so long, a lot of deeply established roots. But at the same time, it's an opportunity to bring in some folks that I think can help us move forward. And we have some good announcements over the last few months of new members of the team that we're bringing on. And their arrivals will be timely in helping to build the teams that they want to have in place as when they just moved. So I'm pleased with how it's going so far, a lot of work yet to do in front of us.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein of Bank of America.
Ronald Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch: Wes, just a broad question for you. Since Northrop truly been kind of narrative [ph] to cutting edge of this push for efficiency with the moves that you've done at the shipyards, I mean, how would you characterize the DoD push for efficiency? I mean, do you think that they can really get out of the industry the savings that they want to get? And I mean, what else would you expect to see industry to do?
Wesley Bush: Yes, I appreciate that question, Ron, because I think it is going to take a lot of thoughtful engagement on both sides, both industry and government to address it. Consolidations I think are going to be a part of it in terms of really looking at the industrial base footprint as we go forward. Our action in shipbuilding is a good representative example of that. I think a lot of what's going to have to be done is related to how the government goes under contract as it tries to think about cost structures. And part of what I've been happy to see in this process is a receptivity on the part of those in government that are pushing on this to hear what they need to do to make it work. It's not all one-sided about. This is what industry has to do, and so when we think about how the government is making decisions, how it's buying, how it manages the oversight functions, those are all things that are in the mix that together, I think, can lead to some very good outcomes. I think we have to get to some outcomes with affordability and efficiency. I think it's incumbent on all of us to make this work, to not be blockers of the process and say, "Gee, it's been tried before, it didn't work before, it's not going to work again." I just don't find that to be a constructive way of engaging on this because we are in it together. We owe it to the nation and to our allies to do better, and I think we can. So I would put it in a category of yes, there are a lot of things we've got to do from an industry perspective, some of which you've seen already get put in place, others that I think are going to unfold as it become far more clear, how that the government is going to focus. But there are a number of things that our government customers are also going to need to do, and that will be a big part of whether or not this succeeds.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky of Citigroup.
Jason Gursky - Citigroup: I know you mentioned that you're working with the Air Force to address the cost issues on the Global Hawk. But can you characterize the nature of the disagreement there and maybe expected timing for the resolution of these issues and potential results, for example, before you see any delays or price cuts to the program?
Wesley Bush: Yes, let me characterize what I see going on with Global Hawk. It has been an extraordinarily successful program from the perspective of providing support to the war fighters that they desperately need. The capabilities of the platform itself, I mean, on the altitude at which it operates, the endurance that it demonstrates, the amount of payload that it can carry has resulted in it being a little bit of a victim of its own success. And that the requirements have continued to grow. Its flight time hours have continued to increase, and as a result, when all of those things happen, costs go up, whether it's cost for spares and theater support or it's cost for supporting all the new requirements. And over time, those costs add up, and you have to stand back periodically and look at it and say, okay, are we at the right place on that? Do we have the right balance between what we really need out of the platforms and what the cost is. That's kind of the process that we're going through with the Air Force right now. We have committed to the Air Force to go on working hard on the affordability part of this. We are doing that. I think it demonstrated some very good progress to date on some of the learning-curve initiatives that we have. There are other things we need to do. So I would characterize that as a set of actions underway, haven't reached resolution yet as to what it all means, so that's what we're doing now with the Air Force. And as we go forward over the next several months, I think that really is the timeline to have a good perspective on, okay, what does it mean for the program, what does it mean for the requirements on the program, what it mean for the production rates as we go forward? So we're sort of in process with the Air Force now.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol of JPMorgan.
Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Wes, I have some follow-up questions actually on the Shipbuilding announcements. Just in retrospects, the kind of thinking about it a week or two later. You mentioned on the last call that you don't want to break the business up into two pieces, but I think you mentioned between that call and today, some time, I believe, last week that you may have interest from bidders in a sale rather than a spin. I'm just wondering why you wouldn't consider breaking it up into two pieces because it would seem to me that Newport is a more salable business given the cash flow profile, and that maybe you could sell that, but perhaps you could find a better prospect internationally to sell off the Gulf yard?
Wesley Bush: Yes, I think the perspective I would offer on that is two-fold. One, as we have brought the two businesses together two and a half years ago, that's when we started down this path, it has become clear there's a lot of benefit to the opportunity of the business to create value for whoever runs it and in terms of the opportunity to serve the customer. There's a lot of benefit in managing this as an integrated business, and that is the view that we're taking as we are looking at the strategic alternative. So as we said a number of times, our first path on the skyway for our strategic alternatives is on spend. And we are also considering the sale part of it, but we are very focused on the spend outcome for separating the business. And so that's really guiding our thinking to a very large extent. The other part of it that I would point out here is that we have a strong commitment to make sure that the separation of the business results in a very healthy, sustainable business that will be able to service customers in a very robust way and be able to serve its owners in a very robust way. And that commitment really leads us to the view that this business will do best as an integrated enterprise, so that's really the way that we're thinking about it.
Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Secondly on this, there's been some customer, was it obviously political things kind of circulating around out there since the announcement, including from Secretary of the Navy. And just wondering if you have any reaction to some of the push-back and any thoughts you might have?
Wesley Bush: I would only say that broadly, the customer base is waiting to see how we take the next steps forward. They're going to want to make sure that we're doing the right things for the future of this business, and we're committed to doing the right things for the future of the business. So I would expect to see a variety of commentary floating around as this process ensues, but we have committed to the Navy to working closely with them as we go through this, and I see us on a good track to make sure we get the right outcome, Joe.
Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co: How inexplicably linked are these two separate moves, which are shutting Avondale and divesting the business in some way? If politically, it becomes impossible to shut Avondale for whatever reason, is the spin or the sale still going to happen because it would seem to me that you're probably selling them together to the Navy, saying, look we're saving you money in total, but if you can't shut Avondale, the cost to the Navy is going to go up because of the additional overhead you're going to be putting on a separate business. So how linked are these two moves?
Wesley Bush: Joe, let me just touch on Avondale for just a moment. We have made a business decision. We are proceeding with that business decision. And from a looking-forward perspective, we believe that, that business decision is the right thing for the customer and is the right thing for the overall business, for the sustainability of that business for the long term. As I said in the call we had a couple of weeks ago, when we think about Gulf Coast shipbuilding, we think it's important to the nation that we have a strong Gulf Coast shipbuilding capability, and to achieve that outcome, we need to consolidate. So we are marching forward in that direction, and I know that, that's difficult from a lot of different perspectives. It was a difficult decision, but we believe strongly it is the right decision that we're moving forward. We see that as a decision focused around the business, what's the right thing to do for the business. The separation decision is a decision focused around the strategy of the company and how we create best value with the two pieces going forward for our shareholders. And we also are focused on driving that to the right conclusions as we explore these alternatives. So I'd be careful about overly linking these things. We see them as two decisions, both of which are, we believe the absolute right decisions for the future of the business.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro of Access 342.
George Shapiro - Citi: Two questions, one for Jim. The 11% guidance in Aerospace for the second half of the year, I mean, implies it's got to go down to 10.6%, and even the first quarter was 11% and there weren't any program adjustments then. So some upward program adjustments continuing, I mean, with at least the higher margin continuing in the second half of the year on some of the programs and NPOESS is probably only about $250 million or even less in revenues for the second half. It just seems like that guidance is conservative unless there's something unique going on in the second half.
James Palmer: I'd say, George, your math is spot on first of all. Second of all, there's always program adjustments in every quarter, and what I said is the rate or the volume of program adjustments in the second quarter were greater than what we have seen in the past. And so I can't really forecast if that is going to continue going forward, so that's essentially how we get to the 11% rate for the year.
George Shapiro - Citi: But I mean in the first quarter you had 11% margin, and you didn't highlight program adjustments. And for the second half, you got to get lower than that. You got to get to 10.6%, obviously, to meet your guidance.
James Palmer: Those guys in the Aerospace sector have been just hitting the ball out of the park this year. And yes, I guess I could agree with you. There's a chance that we're going to do better than our 11% guidance, but if I'd look at it today, frankly, they look at it today, they'll think 11% is where we're going to end the year, but yes, you might be right. There could be upward pressure here.
George Shapiro - Citi: And then just one more in general for you, Wes, I mean, with Carter talking of saving out time-and-material contracts, I mean, you'd see that having much of an impact in your IS business?
Wesley Bush: It depends on where that type of contracting goes. If it migrates primarily to cost plus, then you could have a little bit of a downward pressure on the profitability just because of the differential rates that you sometimes see. Some of that business could migrate fix priced though. And so we kind of have to wait and see what happens to it.
George Shapiro - Citi: You have roughly what percentage of your businesses is time and material now?
Wesley Bush: I don't think we've disclosed that publicly.
James Palmer: No, we have not.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Cai Von Rumohr of Cowen and Company.
Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC: So how much of your move to D.C., how much of the cost of the move do you expect to be allowable and therefore covered by the government? How much might the savings be and how much of that would you have to give back to the government? And on a broader basis, Lockheed kind of went forward with its voluntary separation plan. You've already done quite a lot to sort of take out layers of management. Do you see additional opportunity to do that? And would that accrue to Northrop or does that all go through the Department of Defense?
James Palmer: Let see, Cai. Some of the move costs will be allowable, others will be unallowable. We hadn't gotten into the details publicly. I don't really think it's something that I'd need to do at this point. It's important, but I don't think it's going to be a major driver here and any of our operations on a go-forward basis, nor have we talked about the savings, so I'd just rather leave that alone at this point in time.
Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC: But just from 20,000 feet, I guess the issue is kind of looking at your businesses of businesses, if you take cost out, I mean, obviously, if it's cost plus, your share goes to the government, but if it's fixed priced, maybe you keep some of it. But is the environment changing to the point where the quid pro quo is, guys, you have to take cost out and we need it all. So I think I...
James Palmer: I wouldn't say the environment's changing, Cai. You're right that on a cost-type contract, the government shares in the cost. On a fixed-price contract, we keep the cost savings, but when you negotiate the next year's contract, you give it back. So essentially, the name of the game here is all about affordability. That's driving your cost down so you can really be competitive and win the new opportunities when they arise.
Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC: And then the last one, maybe this is for Wes. You've done a lot already in terms of cutting costs and consolidating. Do you see further opportunity to take out layers of management?
Wesley Bush: Cai, I would say yes, you're right, we have done a lot. In the consolidation of the sectors, we have reduced the management of the company substantially in that process. In terms of where we go as we move forward, we see continuing opportunities to address it, the degree to which those opportunities reside in management layers versus other cost synergies. I don't think I want to go into in great detail publicly, but we do see continuing opportunities to address cost. It's part of what we're working on as we think about the affordability perspective in a broad sense. And to some extent, as I said in response to an earlier question, it depends a little bit on how the customer's going to approach this. Oftentimes, organizational structure has to mirror the customer to some extent, support all of the compliance functions that you engage in as we work to make sure that we are doing all the things that our customers expect. As those expectations could be modulated going forward, that might provide some opportunity as well.
Paul Gregory: And Wes, you want to make a few comments and...
Wesley Bush: Yes, I would just say in summary, we had another solid quarter in terms of performance. We are continuing to proactively manage our business to create value for our shoulders, our customers and our employees. I think you can see that our results this quarter reflect our focus on improving our performance, and just to reiterate what I've said a number of times before, our number one priority across all of our businesses, our entire organization is going to continue to be to achieve sustainable performance improvement. So thanks for your interest in our company. We appreciate you joining us on our call today.
Operator: Thank you for joining today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Good day.

Operator: Good day ladies and gentleman and welcome to the Northrop Grumman first quarter earnings conference call. My name is Michael and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time all participants are in listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer portion at the conclusion of the presentation. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today’s conference Mr. Paul Gregory, Vice President of Investor Relations; please proceed sir.
Paul Gregory:  Very good, thank you Michael. Good morning everyone and welcome to the Northrop Grumman first quarter 2010 conference call. We’ve provided supplemental information in the form of a PowerPoint presentation that you can access at www.northropgrumman.com.  Before we start, please understand that matters discussed on today’s call constitute forward-looking statements, pursuant to safe-harbor provisions of Federal Security Laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which are detailed in today’s press release and our SEC filings, and may cause actual company results to differ materially.  During today’s call we will discuss first quarter results and our guidance for 2010. We will refer to non-GAAP measures, which are defined and reconciled in our earnings release. I also want to point out that results for all periods reported reflect the tax divestiture, which was completed in December of 2009. On the income statement task sales, operating income, and the net gain on sale are accounted for a discontinued operations for the first quarter of 2009 and for all periods presented. On the call today, are our CEO and President Wes Bush; and Chief Financial Officer Jim Palmer. With that, I think we are ready to go to slide three and at this point I would like to turn the call over to Wes.
Wesley Bush: Thank you, Paul. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us. This morning we will discuss our first quarter results, operational highlights and Northrop Grumman’s outlook for 2010.  Overall we are pleased with the quarter; EPS grew 37% to $1.51 of higher sales, higher operating income and lower shares outstanding. We now expect 2010 earnings from continuing operations of $5.75 to $6 per share, due to operational improvements. Cash flow for the quarter was impacted by some timing issues, but as we look at the year, we are comfortable that we will meet our cash guidance.  During the quarter we repurchased $8.3 million shares of our stock for approximately $500 million, and approximately $440 million remains on our current authorization. Combined with last year’s fourth quarter repurchases of 8.4 million shares, we have now essentially offset the task divestitures impact to 2010 earnings per share. As a result we expect share repurchases to moderate from the phase of the last two quarters.  First quarter new business awards totaled $6.9 billion, bringing total backlog to $67.5 billion or approximately two years of sales. The decline from year-end is almost entirely due to a $1.4 billion decline in ship building backlog, where order flow is more lumpy due to the size and duration of contract awards.  Looking ahead, we have many exciting new business opportunities. At the company level E-Mars is a key competitive ISR opportunity to develop under aerial common center requirements. Northrop Grumman can bring an unparalleled set of capabilities to this pursuit from across our sectors and E-Mars announcement is expected sometime in the fall. For aerospace in the unmanned domain we are pursuing several major new programs including UCLASS. This is a multibillion dollar Navy opportunity that builds in our UCLASS work and leverages our industry leading unmanned technology.  We are also pursuing NATO AGS, a $2 billion program to deploy Global Hawk’s for NATO and other promising international targets. We continue to make good progress on BAMS, our Global Hawk derivative for the Navy. This program is currently in development, and the Navy has plans to procure multiple systems in the future, and this represents a terrific opportunity for us down the road when the program goes into production.  On the manned side, we have major international opportunities on advanced Hawk Eye and the FA18. In space we have opportunities for additional Advanced EHF payload builds and upgrade and we are pursuing the precision tracking space system, which builds on the recently launched STSS missile-tracking program.  We continue to be excited about our broad array of differentiation sensor products and electronics, such as VADER, our Vehicle and Dismount Exploitation Radar, which is capable or tracking vehicles and foot traffic over a wide area, and SABR our Scalable Agile Beam Radar, which will provide state-of-the art radar performance for the F16. Our information systems sector continues to pursue a robust set of target, including the joint space operations center mission systems, which we expect to be awarded later this year. We are also excited about being BAEs teammate on the Ground Combat Vehicle, which over the long term could be a major program for the company.  In shipbuilding, we are working with the Navy on follow on awards of the DDG, LPD and LHA classes. Finally technical services also has a number of new opportunities primary in the logistics and maintenance area including longer term opportunities like the C21, and C9, CLS programs. So although we expect top line budgets to remain under pressure in the coming years, we continue to address a very robust new business pipeline.  Now I’d like to touch on a few of the operating highlights. As I said on our last call, our number one priority is to achieve sustainable operating performance improvement. Our sector results this quarter supported chief and of our performance objectives for the year.  Aerospace systems had a strong quarter in which they expanded their operating margin rate to 11%. We continue to see growth in our manned and unmanned programs as development programs like Global Hawk and advanced Hawkeye move into production, complementing strong performance and legacy programs such as the FA18 and B2. During the quarter we continue to build on our base of franchise programs with new business awards for advanced Hawkeye, Global Hawk, Restricted Work, ICBM, Joint STARS and the FA18 program. Our industry leading unmanned systems continue to deliver mission enameling capabilities to our customers.  Global Hawk is providing unparalleled and theatre service. It also recently demonstrated its utility in civil mission with an AgroScience flights for NASA and in supportive earthquake relief efforts in Haiti, and Fire Scout deployed aboard the USS McInerney successfully supported its first drug interdiction mission. Electronic systems also had solid results for the quarter, with a 12% operating margin rate. The lower margin rate this quarter principally reflects lower performance on a flat sequencing system program, which resulted from higher integration, test and deployment cost.  We expect ES will meet our guidance of a mid-to-high 12% margin rate for the year despite the slow start in the first quarter. Operational highlights for the included a $143 million order for more than 500 Lightweight Laser Designator Rangefinders for the army. To-date more than 1300 of these systems had been delivered and fielded in Iraq and Afghanistan.  We delivered our 500 Directional Infrared Countermeasures, aircraft self-protection systems and our STARTLite program completed all of its testing. STARTLite is a lightweight multifunction radar that can support a variety of manned and unmanned platforms for tactical reconnaissance surveillance and target detection, and shortly after the end of the first quarter our F-35 radar successfully flew its first mission systems flight.  Information system sales were slightly lower than last year primarily due to the plan decline in Civil Systems volume related to lower state and local government volume. We view improving performance in IS as one of our best opportunities, so we are particularly pleased with the 8.9% margin rate for the quarter.  We continue to move along a path of sustainable performance improvement at IS. We had important positive developments this quarter on our VADER program. The Common Wealth of Virginia announced a comprehensive set of changes to the VADER contract. We believe the new agreement is an important forward in both parties. Upon completion of its review period in late June, the modified agreement will significantly improve the clarity of program scope and performance expectations. Another positive was the 7% increase in IS new business awards. We were one of two contractors selected for the development phase of the Navy’s consolidated afloat networks and enterprise services program or CANES. This will lead to a down select of the contract to improve interoperability and affordability at shipyard networks systems across the fleet.  We also continue to capture restricted business in our intelligence division, and defense systems was awarded additional work for our battle field air borne communications node or BACN, which is providing in theatre war fighters with critical real time battle field information. For shipbuilding, first quarter sales increased 25%, which reflects to the extra working days this year, and revenue step backs in last years first quarter. We continue to focus on improving performance in the gulf and our 6.2% margin rate this quarter reflects that progress. The four LPD ships in the gulf remain our biggest challenge going forward.  As we said last quarter our improved operating system provides enhanced visibility that a name was asked to continually assess performance. Last week we redelivered the USS Enterprise to the Navy. The recent redeliveries of the enterprise, the Karl Vincent, and George H. W. Bush will result in lower carrier volume going forward and will contribute to more ratable ship building sales for the balance of the year. Technical services had a very strong quarter with margin rate expansion is at 6.4%. This reflects our strategy of focusing on higher margin opportunities, especially in the life cycle optimization and engineering business area.  In summary, we are refining our sales estimate for the year to approximately $34.5 billion and raising our EPS guidance to reflect this quarters strong operational performance. The new range is $5.75 to $6 per share. Our focus for the reminder of the year and our number one priority across the entire organization will continue to be achieving sustainable performance improvement. Improving performance and disciplined cash deployment intend to be Northrop Grumman’s greatest share holder value drivers. As a management team we are firmly committed to realizing positive performance improvements in all of our businesses, and we demonstrated some of that improvement with our first quarter results.  So now I’d like to turn the call over to Jim for a more detailed discussion of our quarter and our 2010 outlook.
James Palmer: Thanks Wes, and good morning ladies and gentleman. During my comments this morning I’ll give you my perspective on the quarter, the sector results and our guidance for the sectors, as well as cash flow performance and guidance for the year.  As Wes said, it was a good solid quarter, and a good start for the year. EPS growth was 37%, with sales operating improvement and a lower share count being the biggest growth drivers. Due largely to cost caps implemented in 2006, we do not have a charge related to the recent legislative changes impacting the Medicare Part-D subsidies. You all might remember that we indicated in our 10-K that Medicare Part-D subsidies were not significant.  Let’s look at the quarter; starting with sales, a growth rate of 8.5%, which including the impact of more working days in this year’s first quarter. Excluding that impact we estimate that sales growth was consistent with our guidance for the low single digit growth rate.  Operating income increased 24% due to lower net pension expense, higher segment operating income, and lower cooperate allocated expenses. Then the third driver of EPS growth was nearly 8% reduction in our weighted average share count, as a result of our share repurchase program. So let me start with sales then again, and try to put it into a little bit of perspective sue to the additional working days.  Depending on the sector of the impacts, and impacts like the snow on the East Coast that we saw in the first quarter, the additional days ranged anywhere from two to five days, and obviously the impact was not uniform across the five sectors, but I estimated it accounted for about $400 million of this quarter’s year-over-year growth.  Then another $100 million growth reflects the first quarter 2009 step back in sales that we recorded in shipbuilding due to the negative contract adjustments on the LPD and DDG programs last year in the first quarter. So adjusting for those two items sales growth was between 2% and 3%, and as I said, consistent with our updated guidance for the year.  On an earnings per share basis, the additional working days represents about $0.08 per share. So looking ahead, the fourth quarter of 2010 will have fewer working days then last year’s fourth quarter, with the second and third quarter’s having the same number of work days as in 2009. So, let’s spend a few minutes and talk about each of the sectors. Aerospace sales reflect the impact of the extra working days with some modest growth beyond that. For the year we continue to expect stable revenues with some variability depending on the timing of the imposed restructuring. Until that program is restructured we continue to work under our current contract with 2010 first quarter revenues for IMPOSE being comparable to last year.  Aerospace sales performance reflects the overall strength of its portfolio, especially in light of last year’s KEI termination, which represented about $60 million in sales in last years first quarter, that were not repeated this year. Solid sales results were accompanied by the strong 11% operating margin, 50 basis points better than last year, due to improved performance across a number of different programs. For the year we continue to expect a mid 10% operating margin rate, but I think we could essentially do slightly better as well. Electronic sales grew 5%, reflecting the extra days with a 12% operating margin. The lower margin rate this quarter reflects the lower performance on our flat sequencing system program, as well as lower royalty income than in the prior year, and a small provision for work force reduction at some selected sites at ES. They recently announced a small reduction in work force to rebalance the skill mix required for the existing backlog and anticipated new awards. For the year we continue to expect ES operating margin rates in the mid-to-high 12% range.  For information systems, the additional days were not a significant benefit in the quarter, due to the snow days in the East Cost. The decline in stable revenues, which were anticipated or planned, were partially offset by about a 4% increase for our intelligence programs, where we continue to see growth opportunities.  In our defense systems division, revenue was down slightly this quarter, due to the higher volume of in-theater hardware deliveries during the first quarter of 2009. This included programs like the command force platform, trailer mounted support system, counter artillery and motors, and integrated base defense security system. Looking forward, we continue to see good demand in our core chief ISR areas and intelligence, particularly in a number of restricted areas. We do see some pressure on IS sales for the year, but we are also increasing our margin rate guidance for information systems to the mid 8% from lower to mid 8%.  Shipbuilding sales increased 25%. This increase needs to be good in context in terms of what I expect for the balance of the year. $346 million sales growth for the quarter was driven by several factors. First the additional days accounted for about $115 million of growth. Secondly, last quarter’s first quarter sales were reduced by about $100 million step back in revenues for the LPD, DDG, EAC adjustments, and thirdly we experienced some cost growth in LPDs this quarter as we work towards ensuring that we are producing and delivering quality ships.  Looking ahead, shipbuilding sales will be more ratable for the rest of the year due to the redelivery of the enterprise, which contributed about $55 million of revenues in the first quarter that obviously won’t continue for the balance of the year. As Wes said, we expect shipbuilding sales will be approximately $6.2 billion for the year, and are comparable to the 2009 sales level, with margin rate between 5% and 6%.  Technical services had a 21% sales growth and their operating income increased 32% to 6.4%. First quarter sales benefited from the additional days and included higher volume for existing programs like the Counter Narco-Terrorism program, as well as new programs like KC-10 and C-20, which were competitive captures in 2009.  Higher operating income and higher operating rate reflect the volume increases, as well as the more favorable contract mix towards the higher margin life cycle optimization engineering programs. We continue to expect a lower-to-mid 6% margin rate, and sales could be stronger than our original guidance at 2% to 4%, depending upon IDIQ task order levels over the balance of the year.  Turning to cash for the quarter, operations used $571 million of cash and free cash flow. Outflow totaled $669 million for the quarter. As many of you know, the first quarter is typically our lowest quarter, but in addition to the seasonality issues there were several timing issues that impacted our results.  The first was a delay in information systems billings, and collections, which was related to the task divestiture. This along with a decrease in payables negatively impacted working capital by about $425 million. These were timing issues. We are already in process of recovering those issues in the second quarter.  The first quarter also included an additional payroll payment sue to the additional days in the quarter, as well as the higher federal tax payments. These two items represented about $150 million, and so when I consider each of those items, as Wes said, we are comfortable with our guidance for cash flow. We continue to expect cash flow from operations at $2.5 billion to $3 billion for the year, and free cash flow in the range of $1.7 to $2.2 billion before the discretionary pension contributions. Also as Wes mentioned, based on first quarter results we no expect earnings per share from continuing operations to be $5.75 to $6 per share, a new increase of $0.05 for the year, driven by higher sales at shipbuilding, say potentially higher sales in aerospace systems and technical services, with higher margin rates for information systems and potentially slight increase in aerospace systems, I see as the drivers for the increase.  So I would say in summary, a good solid quarter, one that supports our improved operational outlook for the year, and demonstrates to focus that Wes talked about in driving sustainable performance improvement, and that performance improvement yielding results.  So Paul, I think with that we are ready to turn it over for question-and-answer session.
Paul Gregory: Very good. Thanks Jim. Michael I think we are ready to go Q&A.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn of Credit Suisse. You may proceed.
Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse: Good morning.
Wesley Bush: Good morning Rob.
Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse: Wes this topic has been talked about so much, so I thought perhaps you could quickly just walk through your current position on getting back in the tankers as a subcontract, would you be interested?
Wesley Bush : No we have withdrawn completely from the tanker competition. We were I think very clear, very transparent around how we made that decision, and I think we gained to a very timely notification of the defense department, and broadly to the community of our position on tanker after the final RFP was released. So we are no longer participating in the tanker competition.
Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse: Anyway, I guess what I am getting at is, would being the sub de-risk it enough to make sense.
Wesley Bush : No we concluded we were not interested in participating.
Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse: Okay and then for Jim on the shipbuilding revenue flow throughout the rest of year, you just talked about why it's front ended, the extra work days so forth and the delivery of the enterprise. How should we think about the Q2 through Q4 run rate, because it sounds like Q4 will be the lowest or should they be more even than the rest of the business?
Wesley Bush :  I see it as more even over the next three quarters.
Robert Spingarn – Credit Suisse:  With the margins similar?
Wesley Bush :  Well our guidance is 5% to 6% for the year.
Robert Spingarn – Credit Suisse: Understood. So you are going to be lower than this quarter, but will the margins be even throughout as well?
Wesley Bush : We look the margins every quarter and as I said a number of times, I look at this business as a very long-term business and so I don’t pay attention that much to the quarterly margin. I look more at the long-term margin rate.
Robert Spingarn – Credit Suisse: Okay, and then finally, how did the insurance recovery affect the factor?
Wesley Bush : Essentially, as we said we had cost growth and LPDs and then the insurance recovery was essentially a recovery of some of the cost growth that we had previously recognized on LPD. So those items taken together contributed a small or single digit type number to the quarter.
Robert Spingarn – Credit Suisse: In terms of margin and/or cash flow, how should we think about?
Wesley Bush : Positive cash flow from the insurance recovery negative from the cost growth.
Robert Spingarn – Credit Suisse: Okay. Thanks very much.
Wesley Bush : Thanks Rob.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned of Sanford Bernstein. You may proceed.
Doug Harned – Sanford Bernstein: On information systems three years ago there has been a strong focus on growing the top line there, and that lead to the state and local programs that have been pretty difficult, and today when we look at the environment ahead, and I’d say it’s a little bit more challenging, and you’ve shifted away from pursuing state and local outsourcing deals, can you describe what your top line growth aspirations are for information systems; and which business area is you really see offering the most potential for growth?
Wes Bush:  Thanks Doug. This is Wes, let me address that. We have been I think very clear when you referenced it that we have taken a very careful look over the last few years of state and local, just determined that that is not really a very attractive marketplace for us, given the way that we typically bring ultimate value to customers, and so we’ve been backing away from that, and as we said in your remarks, our sales and our civil systems part of IS have been on a plan to decline as a result of those decisions that we made. At the same time, the defense business and the intelligence business had information systems, which together represent right around 75% of our total sales of IS, are strong healthy businesses, and when I went through my earlier remarks and opportunities you probably noticed that there were quite a few of the opportunities that I discussed associated with information systems.  We bring a number of what we see as truly discriminating capabilities to defense and intelligence, ranging from the work that we do in command and control, the work of course that we do ISR where we have some just absolutely permanent positions, and the work that we do in cyber security, which we see continuing to grow quite robustly.  So we are optimistic about the outlook at IS, and both intel and defense. We see sort of a little bit of a longer cycle for civil, largely driven by bringing the expertise that we have in cyber security form intel and defense, into many of our civil applications where we are beginning to see the cyber capabilities as an enabler to go after some of the more sophisticated requirements of other federal agencies. So, we like this business. We think it’s a good business for our future, and we are looking forward to getting to the right place in our balance of the portfolio on civil, and continuing to grow the rest of the business. Let me also give a perspective of how we are thinking about that growth. There are various layers in the information systems market. We are really focusing our attention on the layers where we can bring real value through engineering content, where we have truly differentiated offerings, and where the margin opportunities are consistent with our margin expansion objectives in the company. So we will not be going after opportunities in this space simply because of top line revenue opportunities. We are looking very carefully at the opportunities as to whether or not they support our margin rate objectives.
Doug Harned – Sanford Bernstein: Okay, and then just switching gears for a moment. You recently described your UAV business as generating about $2 billion in revenues. What fraction of that is try to HALE systems, and when you look at other parts of your systems, you mentioned a couple in your opening remarks, how do you see growth proceeding there?
Wesley Bush : Well hour HALE systems represent the preponderance of our sales in UAV. The HALE systems are large platforms, each individually large, and they are large programs such as Global Hawk and BAMS. So naturally they do represent a substantial fraction.  As we look at the emerging requirements, we see a very healthy continuing future for HALE. The idea that you can have an asset at an altitude that affords it an enormous amount of visibility and collection capability and availability over many, many long hour of duration of focus is just a very, very useful tool for the military. With that said, while we are really focused on growing HALE, we are also focused on some of the other applications and there is a long list I could point out, but one in particular is UCAS. The concept of having unmanned operations off of a carrier, will transform a lot of the fundamental concept of operations for force deployment, and we see that as another groundbreaking opportunity in the application of unmanned. We have a lot of other great actions going on unmanned; whether its Fire Scout or even smaller unmanned vehicles, we continue to apply a lot of engineering and innovation to this field. We want to stay differentiated technologically and capability wise, because we see this as a business area that’s got a great future.
Doug Harned – Sanford Bernstein: Very good. Thank you.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo. You may proceed.
Sam Pearlstein – Wells Fargo Security:  Hi, good morning. Can you talk a little bit more about Aerospace. I think you had said in the past that we should see the year fairly stable in revenue. In light of this strong growth this quarter I know that extra days were in there, and so I am just wondering as you think about the remainder of the year, is there anything that should be weakening, that would take the current margin of 11% back down to the mid nines and growth rate a little bit lower?
Wesley Bush :  Sam in terms of revenues as I said in my comments, the biggest variable at this point in time is the IMPOSE program and how its going to be restructured and what work we’ve going to retain on a go forward basis.  So we continue to work with that the customers on that potential restructuring, but at this point its unknown exactly what’s going to happen there, and so I guess maybe I’m a little cautious as to what the future revenue outlook is for that program on a go forward basis. In terms of performance margin rate, absolutely wonderful quarter out of those guys this quarter. 11% margins and as I said the, guidance for the year is still to mid tens with some opportunity I think to increase margins as we go through the year, but probably too early to call at this point in time.
Sam Pearlstein – Wells Fargo Security: Okay. Can you frame in terms of how large IMPOSE was in 2009.
Wesley Bush :  I think what we said in the first quarter call in January, year-end call, was that IMPOSE was kind of about $520 million kind of number for the year, and its pretty ratable over the year.
Sam Pearlstein – Wells Fargo Security: Okay. Thank you, and then actually Jim, can you just talk about some of the below the operating line numbers as we look forward to the year. Interest is certainly higher in the first quarter than I would have expected. How do you think that plays out for the year in the tax rate as well?
Jim Palmer:  Interest; essentially we sold and I guess it was second quarter of last year, $850 million of debt, so that contributed to the additional interest cost of share, as well as some capitalized leases added some interest costs for the quarter.  In terms of tax rate, on a regular basis I would say the kind of the 34.5% is what I would expect on a go forward basis. We do have the potential or the resolution of the 2004 to 2006 IRS exam, which could be favorable to tax rate for the year if resolved in our favor, which frankly that’s our expectation.
Sam Pearlstein – Wells Fargo Security: Okay great. Thank you.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss of UBS. You may proceed.
David Strauss – UBS:  Good morning.
Jim Palmer: Good morning.
David Strauss – UBS: Wes, can you talk about where you are in VITA. It looks like you complete negotiations with Virginia in the quarter. Obviously you took up the IT margin expectation for the quarter. Did resolution on VITA have anything to do with that?
Wes Bush:  All right, it helped a little bit. I think the main perspective on VITA is more forward-looking in terms of where we are going on a contract. We spent a lot of time together with the VITA organization in the commonwealth, and with the administration of commonwealth, really working to get the parties together and focused on how we move the program forward as you know.  The program involves many, many different agencies across the commonwealth, and we were very pleased with the modified agreement, because we do think it brings a lot more clarity into the actual scope and the specific performance expectations, so that we get better alignment between the customer and ourselves around where we are applying the energy to get to the outcomes. So we see it as good stuff forward, but we think the goodness of that manifests in the future as we go forward, largely in the future. So that’s the way I would characterize VITA.
David Strauss – UBS: Okay and Jim, was there any pension contribution in the quarter, and can you give us an update if there any CAS harmonization?
Jim Palmer:  On pension contributions, we had our normal required contributions, and frankly I don’t recall how much that was for the quarter. We did have a voluntary contribution of $30 million related to some of our foreign pension plans. So that was the only unusual item if you want to characterize it that way in the quarter.  On CAS organization, we’re waiting just like all of you are for some indication of how and when it’s going to proceed. I really don’t have any new or more current information David.
David Strauss – UBS: Okay and timing on the $300 million that you’re looking to contribute this year to the country plan voluntarily.
Jim Palmer: Second quarter.
David Strauss – UBS: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel of Jefferies. You may proceed.
Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Company.: Thank you very much. To return to the shipyard Wes, there is obviously a restart that’s going to proceed with the DDG 51. What are you doing to bring this ship into the yard, so that it performs -- the work just gets done a lot better and more efficiently and so on, the planning you are undertaking there?
Wes Bush: Yes Howard, thanks for asking. The DDG restart program is a really important program for our company. It represents as you know, an opportunity to continue a line of ship class that over the years we have demonstrated very, very good performance on. The last few years as we went through some of the struggles in the gulf, that performance declined, but we expect that with the new class of ships we will be able to return to the level of performance demonstrated in the past.  A big part of that is the operating system that we put in place in the gulf, that’s up and running. That’s giving us the type of transparency and the degree to end up understanding that we need to not only better plan the execution, but in real time really see how it’s going. In a shipyard that it’s managing multiple classes of ships compared to the past back in the 90s, when it really was primarily just the DDG program that it was going through. So we feel good about the progress that we’ve made operationally in being able to get that under way.  The other thing I would say though is, we are not yet under contract fully for those DDGs. So we are in a process of working through the contracting of the navy, and we are very focused on making sure that those contracts support our opportunity to perform well. So, we are looking at it both operationally and contracting to make sure that we end up in the right place.
Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Company.: Just to follow, one more item on the shipyard in general. I mean at one point, there was either skill shortages or just other things that just weren’t right. How would you characterize what you’ve done to sort of give you the confidence that when you wake up in the morning you are not going to find something bad happen.
Wes Bush: Well, I would characterize it on just about every front of the operational perspective of our shipyard involved. As you know, we integrated, we brought together the Newport News operations, the Gulf operations under common leadership of Mike Petters at the beginning of 2008. So we are more than two years into that process. By doing that, we have been able to bring a lot of things from Newport News to the gulf and quite frankly vice versa.  We have I think done a very good job under Mike’s leadership. Mike and his team’s leadership of figuring out how to best optimize where we are going, and that means looking at every single aspect. We talked a lot about the operating system and how we actually manage the flow of the work through the yard and the gulf.  Quality was another area where we just put an extraordinary focus on changing the way that we’ve addressed that opportunity. Leadership development, talent development, training of the workforce, you name it, just about every aspect of the operational capacity in the gulf, and then translating a lot that back into Newport News.  So I think while we are clearly not out of the woods, we have a margin rate that we are forecasting in ship building this year. That’s not a margin rate that we would be happy with in the long term, but it does represent a good step up over last year. We still have several programs, primarily the LPDs in the gulf that are operating at low or no margin rate, that will pull us down for awhile on our margin rate improvements curve, but I see us making the solid incremental steps forward to make the ship building business a business that is doing the right things for both our customers and for our shareholders.
Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Company.: Thank you Wes.
Wes Bush: Thanks Howard.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Heidi Wood of Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.
Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley: Yes, thank you. Chairman, a question for you. Can you talk about the F-35, what kind of revenue growth that you have seen year-over-year and what kind of bookings margins that you recognizing now? Wes Bush Heidi, I’m not going to get into individual booking rates on the program. We did say in the fourth quarter that we adjusted our margin rates on the STD program at Aerospace to reflect our expectation for the change in award fee, and to our milestone and cost scheduled perspective. So we basically did most of that adjustment in the fourth quarter.  We continue to perform on across the company, on outlook programs as well as some small amounts still remaining on STD, principally in the information systems area on the CNI suite, but a little bit remaining on the Aerospace on the fuselage program as well. But most of our effort today on F-35 is albeit related, and revenues have an increase over 2009, but I wouldn’t characterize it as that significant at this point in time.
Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley: Alright, thank you. Then maybe a bigger question. Wes you guys have started strong out of the gate this year with a number of bold initiatives. Can you give us some nail about you thinking about potential or further strategic initiatives or changes ahead that we might be anticipating?
Wes Bush: Well, as we go forward and we understand the environment, we are constantly looking at what it might cost strategic initiatives, but I guess Heidi I would continue to focus your attention on the performance activities that we have underway.  Given the portfolio we have, which we think is very, very well aligned with what our customers need, I think our biggest opportunity for shareholder value creation goes to performance improvement; things like margin, rate expansion, and think smart about how we declare our cash. Those are the two things that we are really focused on and driving on as the most near term opportunities for shareholder value expansion.  Now that being said, we of course are looking very carefully at our portfolio, we are looking downstream, but our media focus is on performance, and deploying our cash wisely.
Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley: Alright, thanks a lot Wes.
Wes Bush: Thank you Heidi.
Operator:
t: 
 : 
Cai von Rumohr – Cowen & Company: Yes thank you very much. On the insurance claim you mentioned a single digit net difference. How much was the claim recovery in the quarter and how much could you still recover because your Q indicates you still have some claims outstanding.
Jim Palmer: The recovery on related to Hurricane Ike, this was the last piece of what we would have expected to get. It was $17 million, and the Q essentially refers to the ongoing litigation with FM Global related to Katrina.
Cai von Rumohr – Cowen & Company: Got it, thank you. Then I noticed your cash flow indicates amortization of assets of $39 million, but the Q suggests you will do $65 million over the remainder of the year, which would suggest a big step down and then $57 million next year. Refresh my memory now, why are we seeing that. I mean are those two items correct and why are we seeing that short fall off.
Jim Palmer: I’m sure they are correct. The fall off next year is due to purchase of intangibles, some of the amortization being completed this year. Why 69 versus 39, I’d have to get it through the details. I will ask Paul to give you a call on that one.
Cai von Rumohr – Cowen And Company: Okay, terrific. Thanks so much.
Jim Palmer: Okay.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jo Nadol of JPMorgan. You may proceed.
Joseph Nadol – JPMorgan: Thanks, good morning. Wes on the share purchases, you indicated that it’s going to come off after this quarter, after the past two quarters were at a higher level. If you just look at where your volume in the last couple quarters were relative to where you were before you sold cash, its about $200 million or $300 million per quarter higher, so that gets you around 500 of excess share purchase. Your proceeds are $1.1 billion. Just can you help put into context a little bit, how you are thinking about share purchase the rest of the year and what is kind of the normalized level here.
Wes Bush: Well, we have been careful never to give an exact forecast when we are in the market of how much we are buying or when we are buying. So I wouldn’t want to stare down that path.  The thing I would just point out is when we divested task, we were very clear about our intent to offset the dilution to earnings per share resulting from that divestiture, through the use of the net proceeds you pointed about $1.1 billion, to repurchase shares, so we increased our rate rather substantially there for awhile.  My comments this morning was simply intended to say we essentially achieved that offset, so we are going to go back to what we might view as a more typical level. I think that’s about all the flavor I would give to it.  We do have a fair amount left in our outstanding authorization, and we continually look at what the level of authorization should be that we seek from our board, and I think you can see from our history, we got a pretty good track record of what we call balance cash deployment in our company.
Joseph Nadol – JPMorgan: Is there any color you can provide on how you are thinking about the M&A?
Wes Bush: We are always looking. We participate in that part of the market place very actively. I would say we will continue to be very disciplined in how we look at it. Given that we are quite pleased with the portfolio we have today, I don’t feel a burning need to fill some gaping hole, but that being said, we do look if there are good value opportunities, and we will look at it even more seriously, but right now I would say that we like the way that we have been looking at cash deployment.
Joseph Nadol – JPMorgan: Okay and then just one more for you Wes. On the bookings, you were above 0.8 I guess in Q1 in terms of book-to-bill, and you read about the whole bunch of pursuits this year. I’m wondering if you can put it into context and provide what your bookings target is, or even arrange for the year, where you expect to end the year in terms of backlog?
Wes Bush: No, we typically don’t guide in terms of backlog. The one thing I would say Jo in that regard when we look at our backlog, first off we don’t report in our backlog on the unfunded side, either unexercised contract options or unfunded IDIQ orders, and as time has gone by, we are finding more and more things are getting handled through the IDIQ channel.  So if you look interestingly at our funded backlog for the quarter, which is in the release that we put out, every single one of our sectors grew their funded backlog year-over-year, and that is I think a good place for us to be. We are satisfied with where we are right now in backlog. Of course I’d like to expand it, and we are working hard to expand it. So, directionally I would say our objective is up, but I would shy away from being very quantitative with respect to an outcome for the year.
Joseph Nadol – JPMorgan: Okay, thanks.
Wes Bush: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard of Macquarie. You may proceed.
Robert Stallard – Macquarie: Good morning.
Wes Bush: Hi Rob.
Robert Stallard – Macquarie: Just a couple of quick ship questions. First of all on LPD, you said there was some cost creep in the quarter. Is that just reality protruding out with your estimate cost to complete or is there any new issues here?
Wes Bush: I wouldn’t characterize it as new issues. As we have said, the operating systems and processes that we have put in place gives us greater visibility on a more current basis, and so every quarter we look at the performance in those and other ships and make some small adjustments, and that’s really what we saw this quarter.
Robert Stallard – Macquarie: Then on the submarine front, as you mentioned that so far, what do you think the impact will be on Northrop Grumman as the Virginia class submarine moves to two year, looking at both your revenues on your operative margin.
Wes Bush: That’s out in the 2012, ’13 timeframe Rob.
Robert Stallard – Macquarie: You’ll be getting some long lead items I would have thought and … 
Wes Bush: We are getting some growth in Virginia class between now and then, when it really starts to make a difference is 
Jim Palmer: And it’s a really good program. The program that’s performing very well, so we look forward to that opportunity to increase production.
Robert Stallard – Macquarie: You have at this stage not prepared to scale how big an impact that could be?
Wes Bush: No.
Robert Stallard – Macquarie: Okay.
Wes Bush: Thank you Rob.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro of Access 342. You may proceed.
George Shapiro – Access 342: I wanted to ask a couple of things. The first quarter revenues you commented were about $400 million higher because of the additional days. I assume that that means the fourth quarter will be about $400 million lower.
Wes Bush: Yes, you got it.
George Shapiro – Access 342: Okay, and then normally though from the first to the fourth quarter, the revenue is anywhere from a higher by $1 billion to $1.4 billion. Would that still hold this year or it's only going to be $400 million or $800 million from the first to the fourth quarter, as opposed to being normally a $1 billion to $1.4 billion difference. 
Jim Palmer: George, as I look at my crystal ball I would characterize revenue this year as much more ratable over the four quarters. So what you see in the first quarter is kind of my expectations for quarterly revenues on a go-forward basis. 
George Shapiro – Access 342: Okay, and then just Jim if you could provide a little more details. You had three provisions in electron, or three comments in electronics that caused the weaker margin. Could you break out how much was like the workforce provision verses the other provision. 
Jim Palmer: So the three items are the flat sequencing sewing program, it's operational issues, the lower royalty. Last year royalty income was like $4 million, and then the provision for the work force reduction, which is single digit type numbers.  The way I look at it George is, if I adjust both 2010 and 2009 for the royalty and the workforce reduction, the 80 basis point decline in margin becomes about 30 basis points. So that then says that essentially 90 basis points was due to the flat sequencing sorting program and the others were these two small items. 
George Shapiro – Access 342: Okay, that’s helpful, thanks. Then just one last one; for the second quarter in a row we’ve seen lower cooperative on allocated. I mean is there something going on there or it just how it happens. 
Jim Palmer: It's lumpy.
George Shapiro – Access 342: Okay, thanks a lot. 
Wesley Bush: Thanks George. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the like of Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs. You may proceed. 
Wesley Bush: Good morning, Noah. 
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs: Hi, good morning guys. Back to IS, I think in your prepared remarks you said pressure on IS though the year. It's obviously lower because of TASC, but just want to clarify that you meant organically and if so can you kind of quantify that. 
Jim Palmer: We didn’t change our guidance first of all for the sales in IS, but as we just look at our business, we do see good growth opportunity in intelligence and the defense business, and we expect that civil would be down. Then I look around the industry and I see other guys having concerns about the Information Systems, and so I’m factoring a little bit of that concern into the business that we still see as having growth in DSD and ISD.  So I’m just hedging a little bit based on what others are saying about there business, but on the other hand as Wes said, we see good opportunities in both the defense piece of our business and the intelligent piece of our business and the command control, C4ISR areas and obviously cyber as well. 
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs: So you do still expect organic growth in the business for the full year. 
Jim Palmer: Yes. 
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs: A follow-up on taker; is there any reason you could potently have to take a charge for bid and proposal activity on that program at any point. 
Wesley Bush: I don’t think so, not at all. 
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs: Okay, and one last question. I think we got some more definitised OCI rules recently, and you know a company that obviously knows a lot there, I was just wondering if you can may be comment on whether or not there is anything in there that was surprising and what the impact might be to the rest of the industry that hasn’t already taken a strategic action that you guys did?
Wesley Bush: I do think it will cause the rest of the industry to talk another hard look at their OCI business. I think that the outcome that we saw out of the DOD confirmed our thinking and our divesture very strongly confirmed it.  The rule that came forward if you decompose it really had sort of three basic types of conflicts that it was worried about; cases were there where impaired objectivity. So if a contractor is giving technical advise on a procurement, and the contract also has some form of financial interest in that procurement, that conflict talked about unfair access to non-public information was kind of a broad statement around how you would look at access, and then the per category around the biased ground rules. That’s if the contract happens to be working on one contract, but you are in a position to help set the ground rules for some future acquisition that it might compete for.  These are pretty broad statements about the way that federal procurement officials need to think about OCI and interpret OCI, and our pretty well aligned with the frame work that we saw are largest customers in the TASK business using when they were alerting us last year that we will not be able to compete for the some of the business that we currently had.  So instead of standing by and watching that business dissipate we think we took a very appropriate action both for our customers, and our share holders, to diverts that business, put it in the hands of an organization that did not have these types of conflicts so that it can grow and thrive. I think with these rules it has a good opportunity to grow and thrive and looking at how its situated, relative to the businesses that remain within some of the other large contractors. So I do think it will cause others to stand back and think carefully about what they are doing.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs: Now, that’s interesting. Thanks a lot, and good quarter.
Wesley Bush: Thank you very much. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Troy Lahr of Stifel Nicolaus. You may proceed.
Troy Lahr - Stifel Nicolaus & Co.: Thanks. I’m wondering if you guys can talk briefly about the competitive landscapes in the information systems area and technical services. Are you seeing more competitors out there as pricing pressure is starting to creep in.
Wesley Bush: I would say on information systems, there are two different answers for information systems and technical services. In information systems, we tend to participate in sort of the higher end of the market place, that’s largely engineering driven, and large-scale solutions driven. 
 : In technical services, that area has always been and I think will increasingly be much more price sensitive. We have sort of three major areas in technical services. We do a lot of base arrange in our systems support group. We do a lot of training work and of course we do a lot of operations and maintenance and logistics work in our lifecycle optimization business. All three of those have, I would say, intense price sensitivity, and I think we will continue to have that sensitivity. So, a little bit different flavor for the two different businesses.
Troy Lahr - Stifel Nicolaus & Co.: Okay and then as you ramp up on KC-10, is the profitability and is that program tracking in line with your expectations?
Wesley Bush: We are going through the ramp up phase, and we are working through what I would characterize as the typical transition issues in ramp up. We are satisfied with the trajectory that we see there, and see this as a really good program opportunity for the company.
Troy Lahr - Stifel Nicolaus & Co.: Alright, thanks guys.
Wesley Bush: Thank you. 
Paul Gregory: Michael I think with that we are ready to end the call.
Wesley Bush: Yes, and so I just appreciate everyone’s interest in our call today. As we said, we think we are off to a good start for the year, a lot of work to be done. We are pleased that we could raise our EPS guidance, and look forward to discussing it with you again on our next quarter call. Thanks everyone.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today’s conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentleman and welcome to the Northrop Grumman fourth quarter earnings conference call. My name is Steve and I'll be your operator for today. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later in the call we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator instructions). I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Paul Gregory, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.
Paul Gregory: Great. Thank you, Steve. Good morning everyone, welcome to Northrop Grumman's fourth quarter 2009 conference call. We provided supplemental information in the form of a PowerPoint presentation that you can access at www.northropgrumman.com. Before we start, please understand that matters discussed on today’s call constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Security Laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which are detailed in today's press release and our SEC filings and may cause actual company results to differ materially. During today's call, we'll discuss fourth quarter and full year 2009 results and our guidance for 2010. We'll refer to non-GAAP measures, which are defined and reconciled in our earnings release and the supporting materials posted on our website. I also want to point out that the divestiture of our advisory services business known as TASC was completed on December 18. On the income statements TASC sales, operating income and the net gain on sale are accounted for as discontinued operations for 2009 and for all periods presented. On the call today are our CEO and President, Wes Bush and our Chief Financial Officer, Jim Palmer. So, I think we’re ready to go to Slide Three and at this time, I’d like to turn the call over to Wes. Wes?
Wes Bush: Thanks, Paul. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us. As Paul said, this morning we’ll discuss our fourth quarter and our full year results as well as Northrop Grumman’s outlook for 2010. We had a solid finish to 2009. Earnings per share totaled $5.21 exceeding our guidance of $5 to 5.15 and we had outstanding cash results. Cash from operations and free cash flow were very strong and when adjusted for discretionary pension contributions and the taxes that we paid on the TASC sale were at the high end of our guidance and comparable to last year’s record levels. During 2009 we continued to deploy cash to create value for our shareholders. We raised the dividend by 7.5% and we used $1.1 billion to repurchase more than 23 million shares of our stock including 8.4 million shares repurchased in the fourth quarter. At year end we had $924 million remaining on our share purchase reauthorization. As we previously announced, the most recent increase in the authorization was funded by the net proceeds from the TASC divestiture. Another 2009 highlight is our yearend backlog of more than $69 billion. Total backlog continues to represent more than two years of sales and includes $32 billion of new awards captured in 2009. We’re very pleased that despite delays on several competitions, our book to bill ratio for the year was 96%. We continue to capture high quality competitive contracts. Turning to results for our businesses, Aerospace Systems continues to perform well. Sales grew 7% for the quarter and 6% for the year. Our unmanned and manned aircraft programs along with our restricted work were the drivers for the quarter and for the year. Volume increases on programs like BAMS, Global Hawk, F-35, F-18 and the B-2 have more than offset declines in some of our missile and space programs. We expect continued strength in both manned and unmanned programs. During the quarter we received a $300 million contract for five Global Hawks. This fixed price and Santa Fe contract runs through 2011. We also introduced the first Euro Hawk unmanned vehicle, marking the first international configuration of the Global Hawk. Aerospace also continues to improve their margin rates with expansion to 10.5% for the quarter and 10.3% for the year. Electronic Systems also had a strong quarter in the year. Sales increased 2% for the quarter and 9% for the year was solid margin rates for both periods. During the fourth quarter the Royal Australian Air Force accepted initial delivery of the first two Wedgetail aircraft and we reached agreement on delivery requirements. Final delivery and full acceptance is expected later this year and delivery of all six aircraft is planned by mid 2011. With Wedgetail development complete and agreement reached on the remaining contract requirements, we believe the financial risk on Wedgetail is behind us. For Information Systems fourth quarter sales were comparable to the prior year and full year sales increased 5%. Margin rates for the quarter and the year were impacted by state income taxes resulting from the TASC sale and lower performance on the Virginia outsourcing contract know as VITA. These two items offset the positive margin rate trends generated in our intelligence and defense businesses, which now account for about 75% of Information Systems sales. These two profitable growing businesses are very well positioned in their markets, including cybersecurity and C4ISR. They will be the performance drivers for the sector. As a result of strong business captured during the year, IS grew backlog by nearly $480 million or 6% to 8.8 billion. During the quarter, Information Systems won the five-year $580 million IBCS program, which is the first step toward enabling integrated joint and combined Air and Missile Defense capabilities. In Shipbuilding, we continue to focus on improving performance in the gulf through the new operating system that we put in place last year. We’re making good progress. The new operating system is providing increased visibility in the workflow and it’s enabling us to better sequence work to reduced cost growth that results from work performed out of sequence. Currently, we’re addressing two quality issues that received some attention in the press and I wanted to address each of them individually. Regarding pipe weld, we’ve been working closely with the Navy since last year when it was discovered that some of our pipe joints may not have met specifications. Beginning in the second quarter of 2009, our EACs were updated to include the expected cost to repair the pipe welds. We believe we understand what’s required to correct the piping. Late last year, LPD 21 experienced a problem with its main proportion diesel engines. We’re working hand in hand with the Navy to identify and understand the real causes of the engine problems and to support implementation of the appropriate corrective actions. Based on what we know today, we do not believe that the corrective actions represent significant financial exposure for the company. We’re confident that quality and performance will continue to improve as we refine and mature the operating approach that’s now in place on the Gulf Coast. The new processes providing better information on a more timely basis and have helped us address some of the cost issues that we faced on our Gulf Coast programs particularly the LPD. Today, we’re under contract for four remaining LPD’s which will be delivered over the next three years. As a result of the LPD issues that we’ve described over the last year, we expect minimum margin on these shifts and the pace of our margin rate improvement in shipbuilding will be impacted by the substantial sales volumes on these contracts over the next three years. In Technical Services, sales increased an 11% for the quarter and 10% for the year. And the margin rates also expanded for both periods. Business capture was outstanding this year. TS won some major competitive awards such as the $3.8 billion KC-10 program and at the end of the year they captured the Saudi Arabian National Guard Contract which has a potential award value of $550 million. For the year TS backlog increased by 10%. So now let’s talk about our priorities for 2010. Northrop Grumman has a tremendous range of capabilities that are well aligned with our customer spending priorities and we have outstanding human technical and financial resources. Our number one priority is to achieve sustainable performance improvement. That’s the message I conveyed to our senior management team at the beginning of the year. Our goal is to instill a true culture of performance across the entire organization. This will shape our decision making, the way we set our strategy and the way that we measure and incentivize our team. Our leadership is driving improvement with a real sense of urgency. Change will not occur overnight but we will succeed at this. I’m excited about what I believe the team can achieve in creating value for our shareholders and for our shareholders and for our customers. Earlier this week the administration released its proposed FY ’11 budget and provided details of the QDR. The release of the budget process is a first step and a very long and dynamic process. In general Northrop Grumman programs are well supported which reflects their relevance and importance to current and future national security requirements. In the days and weeks ahead additional budget details will be available and the deliberative process and Congress will begin. As that process moves forward specific program challenges and opportunities will be more clearly defined. At this early point in the process we don’t want to speculate on the final outcome for any individual program, but in the aggregate it appears that Northrop Grumman’s portfolio continues to be well aligned with the nations security needs. We’re well positioned in high priority areas such as unmanned systems, cybersecurity C4ISR, long range strike and logistics, but we recognize that the investment accounts like all government spending will face increasing pressure. In terms of new business opportunities we’re pursuing high quality growth in a disciplined way, our stands on the upcoming tanker competition is a prime example. Among other issues unless the final RFP is restructured to provide a best value competition one that recognizes value for performance that exceeds minimum capability thresholds and one that enables to improve financial terms this program is not an attractive opportunity for Northrop Grumman. Northrop Grumman’s greatest opportunity to generate value for shareholders is by improving our performance. Our primary objective is to create value through bottom line performance and continued strong cash generation. Consistent with this our guidance for 2010 caused for modest sales growth, with an improved operating margin rate. Our guidance for 2010 EPS from continuing operations is $5.70 to $5.95 and primarily reflects a combination of segment margin rate expansion across the businesses, lower net pension expense and continuing share repurchases. Our guidance contemplates that these improvements will be somewhat offset by a higher tax rate. We also expect continued robust cash flows. Cash from operations is expected to range between 2.5 and $3 billion and free cash flow is expected to range between 1.7 and $2.2 billion before discretionary pension contributions. As a management team, we’re firmly committed to realizing positive performance improvements in all of our businesses. So now I’d like to turn the call over to Jim for a more detailed discussion of our 2009 performance and our 2010 outlook. Jim?
Jim Palmer: Thanks Wes and good morning ladies and gentlemen. My comments begin with Slide Four. I’ll discuss our 2009 results and include some detail on the financial impact of the TASC sale and then update you on the trends, underline our 2010 guidance including pension. I would echo Wes’ comments regarding 2009 performance and add that on a pension adjusted basis, earnings per share from continued operations increased 24% year-over-year, after adjusting for the goodwill impairment charge in 2008. Cash generation was also very strong, essentially comparable to last year’s record levels, when you consider the impact of the discretionary pension plan contributions and the taxes paid on the past divestiture. As you know in 2008 we had outstanding cash results that were driven by substantially reduced working capital while sales in 2008 increased by 6%. This year’s cash results before taxes related to the TASC sale and the voluntary pension contributions reflect relatively stable working capital while sales again grew by 4.5%. So the positive trend in cash management were maintained in 2009 allowing us to continue a balance cash deployment strategy that calls for returning cash to shareholders investing in the business and funding our pension plans. The strong financial results were accomplished well addressing several major operational initiatives. First was the realignment of the seven sectors into five business sectors last January. In addition, to establishing a more customer focused business structure the consolidation also allowed us to reduce overhead and to streamline operations. We have also expended a tremendous amount of effort to improve our Gulf Coast operations with the new operating system that Wes discussed in his remarks. And obviously the TASC sale was successfully executed, this activity was initiated in response to our customers changing initiatives on – all operational conflicts of interest OCI and require considerable effort in achieving a very good market price for the business while at the same time ensuring a successful future for the business. When we announced the sale we indicated that TASC's operating results for 2009 will be reported as discontinued operations in our 2009 and prior financial statements. Not all of the analyst estimates on our financial results were updated to reflect that accounting treatment that was reported today. So in order to help you reconcile your models to our reported results we provided a Pro forma reconciliation. That’s on slide five. It reconciles are reported results with the Pro forma results if TASC had been part of continuing operations for the entire year. The highlighted top row shows consolidated Pro forma results and then under the discontinued operations caption the first row shows TASC operating results that are now classified as discontinued operations. Through December 18th the date of the sale TASC had sales of 1.536 billion and operating income of 147 million, which translates into $0.28 of earnings per share that will move from continuing to discontinued operations. The next line is simply the net gain on the sale which totaled $0.05 per share. Moving to the continuing operations captions state income taxes directly associated with the sale totaled a $106 of which 87 million were directly allocable to our continuing operations. Of that amount 50 million impacted sales and 37 million impacted Information Systems operating margin. The 50 million is recoverable under our cost type contracts and is therefore recognized the sales, while the 37 million was allocated to fixed price contracts and directly impacted that has reduced the IS operating margins for the quarter and the year. These onetime state income taxes reduced earnings per share by $0.08. Finally, in 2009 we paid $508 million for federal and state taxes on the transactions. So cash from operations and free cash flow were reduced by commensurate amount. However, for financial reporting purposes these taxes are recognized as cash from operations in the cash flow statement while the cash proceeds on the sale are recognized in the investing activities section of the cash flow statement. So adding back the taxes to the reported free cash flow, gives us a free cash flow number of $1.9 billion for 2009 that essentially our businesses generated from "its normal operations". This 1.9 million is or has been reduced by the $462 million of after-tax effect of the additional voluntary pension contributions to our plans, pension plans in 2009. Now, I'd like to take a few minutes and talk about 2010 guidance on slide six, we expect to 2010 sales of 34 to $34.6 billion. Our sales guidance reflects growth for Electronic Systems, Information Systems and Technical Services in the range of two to 4% each. Stable revenues for Aerospace Systems and a three to 4% revenue decline in shipbuilding as a result of lower carrier repair and overhaul volume in 2010. Our outlook for Aerospace Systems does contemplate our understanding of the potential restructuring of the NPOESS and F-35 programs. We have not received any formal contractual direction on either program at this point, but for inflows our customers has access to participate in a restructuring other program and the path forward will involve over the next several months. For the F-35 we anticipated a potential change in the program fee structure in the fourth quarter and we adjusted our financial assumptions accordingly. We expect 2010 segment operating margin rate to improve to the low 9% rate from this year’s 8.7%. The improvement will be driven by margin rate expansion across the businesses. In shipbuilding, we are currently booking minimal margins on the LPD program as Wes mentioned and we expect shipbuildings 2010 margin rate to be in the 5 to 6% range. This represents a modest incremental improvement from 2009, but in my view it’s the right level of expectation given where we are in the LPD program. Until we see that our operating systems improvements are generating sustainable performance improvement and that our program mix improves as LPD revenue contribution declines from the delivery of these ships currently under construction margin rate improvement in shipbuilding will be gradual and modest. In the appendix of today’s presentation we provided 2010 sales and operating margin rate guidance for each of the five businesses, for your information. For the company in total we expect 2010 operating margin rate to expand to the mid 8% range from 7.4% in 2009. This reflects the operational improvements that I just described above as well as the substantial improvement in the net pension adjustment. Our earnings per share guidance also assumes a lower share count which is offset somewhat by the higher estimated tax rate of 34.5% for 2010. Moving to cash metrics, as Wes mentioned, we expect cash from operations at 2.5 to $3 billion and free cash flow of 1.7 to 2.2 billion. Both of these estimates are before the impact of planned discretionary pension pre-funding. And on Slide Seven, we provided a bridge from our 2009 earnings per share from continuing operations through our guidance for 2010, so that you can see proportionally on an EPS basis where the improvements are coming from. The largest improvements are operationally driven and from lower pension expense are somewhat offset by lower other net items and then the higher estimated tax rate for 2010. And finally our guidance includes a reduction in the average shares outstanding as we use the proceeds from the past sale to repurchase our stock. In summary, we expect 17 to 22% increase in our earnings per share from continuing operations for 2010. Slide eight provides some additional detail regarding pension accounting. We expect 2010 net pension adjustment to be in expense of approximately 35 million or $0.07 a share. This is an improvement of about $275 million over 2009 and the year-over-year improvement is detailed on the chart and driven by several factors. In 2009 our plan assets earned more than 15%, substantially higher than the 8.5% projected long term rate of return. In 2009, we also made $800 million at discretionary contributions to the plan. So the combination of these two factors significantly reduced our projected FAS expense for 2010 and in addition, our CAS recovery improves by about $25 million in 2010. Those positive factors were offset by 25 basis point reduction in the discount rate from 6.25 to the 6%. And our assumed long-term rate return on plan asset is unchanged at 8.5%. You can also see on the chart that the funded status of the plans improved to 88% at the end of 2009 compared to 84% at the end of 2008. The improvement reflects the cash contributions to healthy plan returns and some adjustments to our actuarial assumptions. And those positive impacts were partially offset by the lower discount rate which increased our year end pension obligation by approximately $700 million. For 2010, we have a $57 million of mandatory funding requirement and our current cash deployment plans call for approximately $300 million a discretionary pension funding in 2010. So, Paul, I think with that introduction, we're ready for some Q&A.
Paul Gregory: Outstanding, thanks Jim. Steve, I think we're ready to go to Q&A.
Operator: Yes sir. (Operator instructions) And your first question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS. Please proceed sir.
David Strauss – UBS: Good morning.
Wes Bush: Good morning Dave.
Jim Palmer: Good morning Dave.
David Strauss – UBS: Wes, you noted the long tail you have with LPD 17. Given that, can you just talk about the upside opportunities there is that ships over the next couple of years?
Wes Bush: Certainly, as you know our shipbuilding business has two major components to it, one is the nuclear business and Newport News and the surplus business in the Gulf. Now, clearly LPD presents a challenge as I mention earlier and as Jim also described in his remarks as we go forward. But when we look more broadly across the portfolio there are also good opportunities that we’re addressing. For example, the increase in the submarine procurement to two per year, starting fairly soon. That is well supported in the budget that will represent very nice opportunity for our Shipbuilding business. And I would say broadly as we looked at the budget coming through earlier this week the Presidents recommending a good strong support for shipbuilding. So as we look out on the horizon we do see our nation continuing to recognize the imperative or strong able cost structure and given our position in shipbuilding that should represent a good opportunity for our business over the longer term. But all that being said I would reinforce what we communicated during our remarks that given that we do have a substantial sales volume on LPD at a very low margin rate it will represent a downward turn on the rate at which we can improve margin rates here over the near term.
David Strauss – UBS: Okay. That’s great color. And then as my follow-up could you just address the outlook on the Information Systems side, obviously the President has talked about freezing non-defensive discretionary spending what kind of impact do you think that could have on the business? And then also where you are today with VITA and how does that run out from here?
Wes Bush: Yes, let me take the first of those and Jim you might want to give a little financial flavor on VITA. With respect to the positioning of our Information Systems business, as I mentioned in my remarks the defense and intelligence components of that business today represent about 75% of the sales. And as you could see and looking at the budget request those areas are very, very well supported with respect to what the administration is requesting and quite frankly we believe with respect to what the Congress will support going forward. The other roughly 25% of the sales is the area that we describe as civil business within Information Systems that is a mix of Federal civil business and state and local. We’ve been fairly clear in our prior communications that we are stepping back from the state and local IT outsourcing market the market that we are not deemed to be particularly attractive. And as a result that is causing that aspect of the business to reduce over time. The civil federal market the market in which we participate continues to represent some very good opportunities for the company. So while our overall civil business is not looking at substantial growth because of the purpose and reducing our exposure in state and local IT outsourcing the component of that marketplace that deals with other departments of government beyond defense and intelligence, we continue to see as representing good opportunities for us going forward.
Jim Palmer: On the financial side, the VITA contract represents a drag on our earnings at this point. As you know we’ve from all press reports we’re have been in conversations with the state or Commonwealth over potential changes to the contract that we think are warranted those conversations continue. I wouldn’t want to speculate on what that outcome might be in terms of the operational activities we continue transitioning a number of the agencies and we continue having conversations with the Commonwealth about whether certain agencies should be a outside the scope or have a different scope associated with their transformation. From a exposure, financial exposure perspective I mentioned in the past that I see this type of contract having two major elements of exposure one is the cost of transformation at this point I think we have a fairly good handle on that subject to resolving the exact scope of some of the agencies. On the other issue associated with these types of programs is the future revenue stream associated with the total contract life. At this point, I would characterize that is the largest variable in our thinking about this program. But I think our financial assumptions at this time are reasonable and reflect that variability as well.
David Strauss – UBS: All right, thanks for the color.
Wes Bush: All right.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies & Company. Please proceed.
Howard Rubel – Jefferies & Company: Good morning. Thank you.
Wes Bush: Hi, Howard.
Howard Rubel – Jefferies & Company: Good morning gentlemen, thank you. First just a follow-up and try to translate Jim's comments on VITA is that mean you are losing money on the contract today?
Wes Bush: We are losing money today Howard.
Howard Rubel – Jefferies & Company: And there is probability you can at least get to break-even or something better than that?
Wes Bush: We're clearly working very hard to achieve that yes.
Howard Rubel – Jefferies & Company: And then and just to go to your outlook for one moment when you talked about stable for Aerospace and modest growth in some of the other categories, could you sort of highlight a couple of puts and takes that get you either – get you to where you are and where we might see some upside or some risks?
Jim Palmer: Let me start with Aerospace and Wes you could jump at anytime you want. Our forecast is for stable revenues in Aerospace. And clearly, as you know, it's a portfolio and so there are a number of programs that are growing. And there are another set of programs that are actually shrinking. So, on the growing side, we see programs like F-35, the F-18 bands and some of our restricted activities continuing to grow. And then on the downside, programs like KEI and TASC that we're capable obviously have smaller or no revenues in 2010 when they had revenues in ‘09. The E-2C is essentially transitioning and completing much of its production activities. And the E-2D is on the front end of the ramp up in production. And so, there is an evolution or decline in E-2 revenues in total. And then UCAS has some lower revenues in 2010 as compared to 2009. Shipbuilding is largely, the decline is largely driven by the amount of carrier overhaul work that we anticipate in 2010 compared to ‘09. And then the technical services growth is largely related to the successful new awards that they won in 2010 or 2009 rather. Information Systems the growth largely is coming out of the intelligence and defense divisions which continue to grow with the civil division actually shrinking somewhat on a year-over-year basis and then the Electronic Systems, just the growth is across the portfolio with again some programs up and others down, but on an overall basis a very well diversified portfolio with growth.
Howard Rubel – Jefferies & Company: Thank you very much. It’s great, thanks.
Jim Palmer: All right.
Wes Bush: Thanks Howard.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed.
Wes Bush: Good morning Doug.
Jim Palmer: Hi Doug.
Doug Harned – Sanford Bernstein: Good morning. Just following on that, on the Aerospace side. I’m interested in understanding the puts and takes because the programs you outlined. If I were to go to 2010, taking care your ICSat out you’re in the transition on E2, I mean this to me and I can’t see into the restricted programs in the space, but it seems to me you’ve got a pretty strong growth trajectory coming out of 2010. Is that fair? And also it seems to be shifting towards production from development at the same time.
Wes Bush: Doug is your question in 2010 or coming after 2010?
Doug Harned – Sanford Bernstein: No, no, no. The 2010, the flatness in 2010 appears to be due to some things. These aren’t secular trends; these are things that are changes that won't be repeated in ’11. On the downside, on the upside actually may get better?
Wes Bush: Yeah I think.
Doug Harned – Sanford Bernstein: Sure.
Wes Bush: Good reflection of the situation Doug.
Doug Harned – Sanford Bernstein: Yeah.
Wes Bush: The other down in Aerospace is the Missile program IPIC [ph] and those kinds of right.
Jim Palmer: Okay. KEI and I pick together in terms of the missile areas represent a meaningful down, but as you point out if you look at the portfolio and the areas where we see the administration recommending continued investment and broken investment the unmanned platforms are certainly an area of substantial focus. The manned platforms that we built had to do away a lot of work in ISR in particular and we see those being very well supported. And of course as we look across the whole set of restricted activities there is some nice opportunities there as well. So I think you’re, in fact it is right the puts and takes always very familiar with the budget ups and downs. But when we look at the, through an Aerospace we are quite pleased with what we have.
Doug Harned – Sanford Bernstein: And then just as a follow on you talked about the tanker and the position you are taking with respect to the structure of the contract and then if it’s structured in unfavorable way with too much risk, that’s not something you will want to pursue. Now, you’ve announced that you’re going to compete on the re-compete on Ground-based Midcourse Defense. I’m curious how you look at that one given that there is an incumbent to obviously has a lot of knowledge about a very complex program. How are you looking at competing on that one in terms of the risk you would take and the kinds of structure that would be acceptable in that kind of bid?
Wes Bush: In fact let me give you reflection on tanker first to make sure that the full picture is well represented. We of course have provided the departments a lot of commentary around the financial terms and conditions that were resident in the draft RFP. And they were a variety of issues there that we identified that represented a risk profile that we did not find acceptable to support our bid. There are other issues associated with tanker beyond the financial terms. As I indicated in my remarks, we're also quite frankly displeased with the approach where value beyond the threshold requirements is not really well recognized in the scoring methodology for the proposal. So as structured it really does not represent a meaningful competitive opportunity for our offering, which inherently is a larger aircraft and inherently provides more capability, but a bigger airplane inherently cost little bit more. So, without that value recognition methodology in the final RFP, we are fundamentally disadvantaged in the source selection evaluation process. So, there are variety of factors that go into our conclusion that unless we see some major restructuring in this final RFP this is simply an unattractive proposition for our company to pursue bidding on. So, that’s a perhaps a little bit broader picture on tanker than just the financial terms and conditions. But certainly the financial terms and conditions are very, very important and every single one of the new activities that we're going to assess bidding upon, we're going to take a very careful look at the financial terms and we are going to be very candid with the procuring organizations as to our perspectives on those. We're early in taking the look at GMD. We are not particularly concerned about competing against incumbents. We have been quite successful at doing that in the past or simply because there is a long entrenched incumbency does not necessarily meaning that you cannot have a very effective opportunity. We’ve demonstrated that last year in our win of the KC-10 Contractor Logistics Support Competition. So GMB is one that we’re taking a very careful look at and we are certainly going to be highly engaged in working with Missile Defense Agency in assessing the procurement terms and giving them our feedback, I believe that they are looking for a good robust competition here and we’re quite interested in that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Please proceed sir.
Robert Spingarn – Credit Suisse: Good morning.
Wes Bush: Good morning.
Jim Palmer: Hi Robert.
Robert Spingarn – Credit Suisse: Just to stick with Aerospace for a moment and some of the moving pieces in there. Can you give us a little better fidelity on what kind of revenue you're flowing on Joint Strike Fighter this year and NPOESS at the same time as well?
Jim Palmer: Yes, our plan would call for JSF revenues or F-35 revenues to be up, maybe a couple $100 million over the 2009 level across the total company not just Aerospace.
Robert Spingarn – Credit Suisse: Right.
Jim Palmer: But Aerospace Electronic Systems and Information Systems. So a few $100 million associated largely with the (inaudible) portions of Joint Strike Fighter as opposed to the STD portion of F-35.
Robert Spingarn – Credit Suisse: And with that total Jim?
Jim Palmer: Pardon.
Robert Spingarn – Credit Suisse: With a couple 100 million out, what kind of total we were looking out there?
Jim Palmer: We really haven’t talked about the total let's just say we are up a couple 100 million.
Robert Spingarn – Credit Suisse: Okay.
Jim Palmer: And on NPOESS our plan is kind of the $0.5 billion range for NPOESS.
Robert Spingarn – Credit Suisse: Okay. And then maybe this is for Wes, on Global Hawk Wes we’ve seen unit funding come down over the past year or two in the budget, at least in the base budget. We did seven a couple of years ago; we’re now doing four, what’s the long-term trend here?
Wes Bush: I think we’re going to see it fluctuate a little bit year to year, it varies across these blocks as each of the blocks has a different configuration with respect to the mission capabilities. We see Global Hawk continuing to be very well supported, continued demand for it in theater and we also see continued new applications. We announced last year that the BACN capability these battlefield communications network nodes were added to Global Hawk and we’re going to be putting BACN on two of the Global Hawks going forward. So we see it well supported, I think we will always see some ups and downs year-to-year and the minute count depending on the block capabilities.
Robert Spingarn – Credit Suisse: Okay and then just moving over to ship building particularly new Newport News. You talked about some of the movement; you or Jim talked about the carrier overhaul diminishing a little bit in ’10, but based on the funding that we just saw on Monday, should we expect a reversal in ‘11 there. To me that looked like very solid carrier funding across the board, new and overhaul.
Jim Palmer: I basically see our shipbuilding business is about a $6 billion business for the next few years.
Robert Spingarn – Credit Suisse: Okay.
Jim Palmer: Put and takes…
Robert Spingarn – Credit Suisse: Would you say that you, how did you react to the funding that you saw on the carriers?
Jim Palmer: Positive.
Wes Bush: Yeah.
Robert Spingarn – Credit Suisse: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Access 342. Please proceed sir.
Jim Palmer: Hello George?
George Shapiro – Access 342: Hello, how are you doing Jim?
Jim Palmer: Pretty good.
George Shapiro – Access 342: First question for you, what caused the big drop in on unallocated expense this quarter versus last year also versus the 55 million in third quarter?
Jim Palmer: Every quarter we take a look at a bunch of different accruals and we've adjusted those accruals and so it's just that normal accrual process of looking at environmental accruals and the true up of prior overhead rates and just a number of those different factors, George. I wouldn’t characterize there is anything unusual and essentially are unallocated in total was pretty much as we thought it would be for the year in total.
George Shapiro – Access 342: Okay. And then just maybe a more general one for you or Wes. How do you contrast such different performance in the sales side now in your shipbuilding business versus General Dynamics shipbuilding business given there are some common programs?
Wes Bush: Yeah, George this is Wes. What I would reflect on there is while there are some common programs there are also some very, very different mixes, certainly we share production if you will on the DDG class and we have some obviously a partnership on Virginia class. But we have some very big programs in our portfolio not in theirs and vis-à-vis. We are the ones that build the carriers we do the Expeditionary Warfare ships the LPDs, the LHAs. So that, those are big differences and contribute to a different outcome with respect to what's getting budget year-to-year and what the magnitude of the future profile is going to look like. So, the common part is important, but certainly not the majority by any stretch of the total sales.
Jim Palmer: In fact I would that, I would expect that there the GDs revenues on DDG-1000 for example are ramping up, ours or not?
Wes Bush: Right.
Jim Palmer: LCS is another one of those differences; there are a number as Wes said a number of meaningful differences in programs on a company-to-company basis.
George Shapiro – Access 342: Okay. And then Jim just a simple one, what were the share the fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of the year?
Wes Bush: 302.
Jim Palmer: It’s in the release I hope.
George Shapiro – Access 342: Yes it’s in the release? Okay. sorry.
Jim Palmer: In the release.
George Shapiro – Access 342: I'll look in the release then?
Jim Palmer: 315.
George Shapiro – Access 342: Well, that was the average, was that also the end of the quarter?
Jim Palmer: I think, I guess we will have that at the K release.##
Wes Bush: Yes, we will see it in the K actually.
Jim Palmer: So that should be out soon.
George Shapiro – Access 342: Okay. Thanks very much.
Wes Bush: Thank you, George.
Operator: Your next comes from the line of Myles Walton with Oppenheimer. Please proceed.
Wes Bush: Hi Myles.
Myles Walton – Oppenheimer: Hey, good morning guys. I was hoping you could perhaps a little bit on the Electronic Systems. And so first on the sales growth side, could you reconcile the kind of outlook for three to 4% growth but funded backlog that’s kind of on at least in near term down trend line. And secondly, could you talk about the international piece of that business, where it is today and where do you think it will be next couple of years?
Wes Bush: International pieces always very lumpy. That’s part of the downward trend that you observed, we were continuing to work a number of major international opportunities they always take quite a while to bring home and so the timing of when they occur will effect that revenue or – both the revenue and the backlog profile. We continue to – as you know the Electronic Systems continues to be the portion of our business that has the most international revenues we really see a relatively stable international profile for that business over the next few years.
Myles Walton – Oppenheimer: Okay. Can I squeeze one in on…
Wes Bush: Sure.
Myles Walton – Oppenheimer: On tax – tax rate you said 34.5%?
Wes Bush: Right.
Myles Walton – Oppenheimer: Does that include R&D or not?
Wes Bush: Does not include R&D, the possibility of a, the R&D credit being reinstated.
Myles Walton – Oppenheimer: And what is the impact again.
Wes Bush: About $16 million tax credit, so about $0.05 a share.
Myles Walton – Oppenheimer: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen And Company. Please proceed.
Cai von Rumohr – Cowen And Company: Yeah.
Wes Bush: Hi.
Cai von Rumohr – Cowen And Company: How are you doing guys, if I could follow up on George's question I mean, I guess some of us missed on unallocated and if it hits you plan, it was certainly down year-over-year, as we model 2010, what sort of a number should we use for general cooperate on unallocated?
Wes Bush: I’m just going to continue with the guidance I gave that top level, I didn’t get into the line by line detail, so I think it's pretty much consistent with that.
Cai von Rumohr – Cowen And Company: It is consistent with that but the problem is that a couple of bps is a big pretty number and this is one presumably you should have some visibility, I mean if we model it about a 150, is that or is it 200 or a 100, because it was about, it was closer to a 100 in 2009 that the…?
Wes Bush: Remember Cai in 2009, we had the resolution of the HPT and the settlement of the TSSAM claim which had an impact, favorable impact in unallocated of about, as I recall $60 million in the second quarter.
Cai von Rumohr – Cowen And Company: Okay.
Wes Bush: So, that’s not going to continue obviously in 2010.
Cai von Rumohr – Cowen And Company: I’m pushing you here so. In fact you are saying it should be closer to the 200?
Wes Bush: I’m not going to give you a number.
Cai von Rumohr – Cowen And Company: Okay. Okay. great. And you mentioned the F-35 you know adjustment in the fourth quarter and the adjustment for next year, specifically could you give us little more color on what the adjustment was and what you are assuming on the F-35 for 2010 and for any cost sharing that you’ll be asked to do?
Wes Bush: Yeah, as I try to say in my comments we anticipated a restructuring of the fee in our fourth quarter close. So we did reduce our recovery assumptions on SDD. As we may know we share fee on SDD in Aerospace Systems not in the other two operations of the company that have F-35 work. And largely our activity in 2010 is associated with growth activity as opposed to SDD activity. So we lowered our fee assumption where we think is appropriate and reasonable at this point in time. I don’t know that we have a lot of exposure going forward.
Cai von Rumohr – Cowen And Company: Excellent. And then you know you have a very broad range of cash flow 500 million range for 2010. Why was that range so broad and what has to happen to go to the upper or lower end of that?
Wes Bush: The range is the same range we had at the beginning of this in terms of cash flow. The big variable is working capital. And we work really hard to manage working capital as I said in my comments we've had two really good years of working capital management but frankly that comes down to the last couple of days of the year when some customers both the government and other primes decide whether they are going to pay us in December or January. So it’s the variability largely around working capital that is accounted for in that range of up of cash flow.
Cai von Rumohr – Cowen And Company: And you said you would use all the proceeds of the sale of TASC to buy back stock is that the after-tax proceeds and because I assume you would bought stock excluding TASC so as we think about this year how much should we think in terms of how much stock you're going to buy?
Wes Bush: Well essentially on the chart that walks from 2009 earnings to 2010 earnings I had given you an estimate of that earnings per share impact for the repurchase program of 30 to $0.35. If we go back at when we announce the TASC sale, we increased the share repurchase authorization by $1.1 billion essentially the net number and so all of our guidance reflects that consistent operation of that information.
Cai von Rumohr – Cowen And Company: Okay. Hey thank you very much.
Wes Bush: Okay.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo Security.
Wes Bush: Hi, Sam how are you?
Sam Pearlstein – Wells Fargo Security: Good how are you? Just a couple of things one is on that corporate over headline I just wanted to ask a question about the move of the headquarters from California to Washington how are you thinking about any one-time charges that are getting absorbed within the 2010 guidance that don't recur in 2011?
Wes Bush: Yeah, I think in terms of one-time cost related to the move since the move is plan to recur in 2011, I think that’s more on an issue for 2011 and 2010 I don’t know that we’re going to incur a lot of cost on the move in 2010.
Sam Pearlstein – Wells Fargo Security: Okay. And then, can you just talk about the order outlook in 2010, do you assume that your book-to-bill will be above one and what are some of the major competitions that you’re going after this year that we should see?
Wes Bush: Sam, let me address that in terms of the major competitions, they’re a couple of that are in process right now where we hope to hear the outcome later in the first quarter. One is the GPS OCX program out of our information system sector and the other is also out of IS CANES [ph] program and both of these cases we’ve had a proposals and been working through the final proposal update processes and I believe that the government is on track for awards later in the first quarter. There are several others that we’re focusing on that appear to get continuing good support in the budget process. We talk about GMD a little bit earlier just kind of add to some of our earlier discussion on that as you know we have been the IPIC contractor for over 50 years. And so, we have a tremendous legacy of excellence and supporting the sustainment and continued evolution of those weapon systems. We believe that brings a strong competency to compete on GMD. So, we’re looking at that one very, very carefully. The EMALS [ph] program, which is another one of the ISR platforms intended to provide more near terms support in the battlefield there is an area that we’re also focusing on but we have a number of strong capabilities with position as well in the EMALS. Chase back is another good example that’s their joint space operation center. We’re taking a careful look at that. We here again have a very substantial side of capabilities and managing space systems and also in large scale operation centers and we’re looking at that and very careful. So if we look across our businesses, we see a wide variety of opportunities and as the administration is continuing to focus in the ISR arena, C4ISR and more probably, certainly in Cybersecurity and some of the other areas that I mentioned in my remarks earlier. So, it is unmanned. We see a very robust side of opportunities. I would say though just put a little bit of flavor on that we are driving a degree of discipline into our system around the evaluation of opportunities that not until beyond where we have been. And so we’re going to be looking at each one of these very carefully to make sure that successful capture of the opportunity supports our objectives or improving our margin rates, continuing to drive the overall performance of the company. So, when we look at the opportunities, we’re not thinking about scale. We’re thinking about performance.
Sam Pearlstein – Wells Fargo Security: Okay. thanks. And just one last quick one for Jim, when you think about the progression of earnings in 2010, is there anything unusual in terms of how much we see in the first quarter versus the other quarters?
Jim Palmer: I think on a quarter – from a quarterly profile perspective, what we’ve seen in the past which is essentially builds as we go from first quarter through the year is what I would expect. We would have again in 2010. So first quarter would lower revenues and then lower cash obviously and then building as we go through the year.
Sam Pearlstein – Wells Fargo Security: Okay. Thank you.
Wes Bush: One more question if we could.
Operator: Sir, your last question will come from the line of Robert Stallard with Macquarie.
Robert Stallard – Macquarie: Good morning.
Wes Bush: Good morning, Robert.
Wes Bush: Good morning.
Robert Stallard – Macquarie: Quickly, pension Jim. There is a big drop obviously in 2010. If you would hit your target discount rate didn't move, you have these assumed payments this year. Where do you think pension could hit in 2011 directionally or what that number?
Jim Palmer: I thought nobody was going to ask that question?
Robert Stallard – Macquarie: Let's try.
Jim Palmer: Here is everything you want to know about pension. In 2010, again the details in the presentation is as I look forward and Rob you are right. You are going to make a lot of different assumptions but assuming we hit our 8.5% long-term rate return. The discount rate doesn't change. We fund what we anticipate. I would see in 2011, relatively constant FAS expense. Our cost accounting, our CAS expense goes up significantly, so that the net difference improves by about the same amount as the 2010 over 2009. That increased in cost accounting, our CAS expense is largely reflecting for CAS the amortization of the 2008 losses and so it's been reflected in our CAS expense as we go forward. And in terms of funding in 2011 and probably a comparable level including the voluntary amounts at least at this point to, to what I anticipate in 2010 and then if I carry that forward one more year probably CAS and FAS stays fairly constant and cash probably goes up, I don’t know 3, 4, $500 million that kind of range.
Robert Stallard – Macquarie: Okay. And there is follow up, just a final question you mentioned in the press release that you have included some contingency for program performance risk and opportunities. I was wondering if you give us an idea of how big that contingency might be.
Jim Palmer: I'd say I have a similar amount as I had in the prior year at the beginning of the year of 2009, that so CAS following question that is part of my unallocated at this point in time.
Robert Stallard – Macquarie: Okay. That’s great. Thanks Jim.
Jim Palmer: All right.
Paul Gregory: Okay. Thank you very much. That concludes our call. Thank you for your participation. Have a good day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen that concludes today conference. Thank you your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.

Operator: Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Northrop Grumman third quarter 2009 earnings conference call. My name is Lacy and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer portion at the conclusion of the presentation. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today’s call, Mr. Paul Gregory, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.
Paul Gregory: Great, thank you Lacy. Good morning everyone and welcome to Northrop Grumman’s third quarter 2009 conference call. In support of today’s call, we’ve provided supplemental information in the form of a PowerPoint presentation that you can access at www.northropgrumman.com. Before we start, please understand that the matters discussed today constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to Safe Harbor provisions and Federal Securities Laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which are detailed in today’s press release as well as our SEC filings, and may cause actual company results to differ materially. During today’s call, we’ll discuss third quarter 2009 results and guidance for the year. We will refer to non-GAAP measures, which are defined and reconciled in our earnings release and supporting materials, which are posted on our website. On the call today, are our Chairman and CEO, Ron Sugar; our President and COO, Wes Bush; and our Chief Financial Officer, Jim Palmer. At this point, please go to slide 3, and I’d like to turn the call over to Ron. Ron.
Ron Sugar: Thanks Paul and good morning everyone and thanks for joining us today. We are very pleased with this quarter’s performance, which was driven by 4% sales growth, a solid 9% segment operating margin rate, strong cash flow, and continued share repurchases. Earnings per share from continuing operations are slightly higher than last year despite our pension headwind. Adjusting for pension, underlying EPS growth was approximately 22%. As a result of improved operating performance and lower tax rate we are raising our 2009 EPS guidance from a range of $4.65 and $4.90 a share, to $5 to $5.15 a share. Third quarter new awards were quite strong at $10 billion, or a book-to-bill ratio of 115%. Based on the strength of new awards, our backlog increased to $71.5 billion, which does not include the substantial backlog represented by our many IDIQ awards. Third quarter cash from operations and free cash flow were also robust, and based on that we continue to execute our balance cash deployment strategy during the quarter. Cash deployment actions included discretionary pension contributions totaling $586 million and share repurchases of $227 million. During the third quarter we repurchased another 4.7 million shares of our common stock, bringing year-to-date repurchases to nearly 15 million shares. At the end of the third quarter, we had approximately $280 million remaining on the authorization. I want to spend a moment on sales, which grew by more than 4% in the quarter and for the year-to-date by more than 5%. These trends continue to reinforce our confidence in the strength of our program portfolio, and our strategic alignment with our customers needs. We continue to see solid market demand in areas like unmanned aircraft, C4ISR, the F-35 program, Cyber Warfare, restricted programs and logistics and sustainment programs. One of the best examples of the strength in our C4ISR positioning is our Battlefield Airborne Communications Node or BACN capability for the air force. This new revolutionary data gateway was created, demonstrated and fielded as a rapid response to challenges faced by the war fighter Insider. The BACN capability will be integrated on to our Global Hawk platform to provide around the clock critical communications capability to our troops on the ground. Insider commanders in Afghanistan and Iraq have identified BACN as an urgent operational need. This is a game changing technology for our war fighters and we are working closely with the air force to rapidly deploy this capability as quickly as possible. As I mentioned earlier, third quarter new business awards totaled about $10 billion and included a contract for the refueling and overhaul of CVN71, the USS Theodore Roosevelt. This contract is valued up to $2.4 billion. We were awarded $300 million for continued development of the army’s distributed common ground system and $150 million for lightening, targeting and sensor systems. Year-to-date, we booked more than $24 billion in new awards. We also won several significant ID/IQ awards that were substantiables in dollar and strategic importance, but won’t show up in the backlogs until individual task orders are received. For example, the air force rays the ceiling of our ID/IQ contract for B-2 modernization and sustainment activities by more than $3 billion. The army selected us to supply Lightweight Laser Designator Rangefinders under a five year ID/IQ contract with an estimated value of $600 million. We also received an ID/IQ contract from the army for laser and target locator modules. This award has an estimated value of $400 million over five years if all the contract options are exercised. And just after the close of the third quarter, we won the competition to provide contract logistic support for the air forces fleet of KC-10 Extender refueling tanker aircraft. The capture of this nine year ID/IQ contract with a $3.8 billion ceiling further solidifies Northrop Grumman’s position as a premier provider of air mobility solutions. We also have near term competitively of opportunities upcoming like the Navy’s Consolidated Afloat Network and Enterprise system or CANES, the air force’s GPS OCX contract and of course the aerial refueling tanker. As you know, the air force released the draft RFP last month. Our team is evaluating the RFP and we are in the process of providing our comments to the customer. Looking ahead, the fiscal 2010 appropriations contracts, the conference is well underway, the quadrennial defense review of QDR is progressing, and the 2011 budget process has also begun. I believe our portfolio will continue to be positively aligned with national security needs. So in summary. At Northrop Grumman, we continue to focus on managing risk improving operating performance and position the company for growth. We just completed a strong quarter which allowed us to raise our 2009 EPS guidance. Our balance sheet is solid. We have an exceptionally strong management team in place. We have a program portfolio correctly aligned with future defense needs and as we drive operating margin improvements, we have the opportunity to create substantial future shareholder value. Finally, in on a personal note as all of you know, I will be retiring as Northrop’s Chairman and CEO at the end of this year, so this will be my final conference call. It has been a privilege to leave this remarkable company since 2003, and I’ve thoroughly enjoyed my interactions with each of you and the investment community along the way. Wes Bush will take the reigns of Northrop in January and there is no one more capable or fully prepared to do so. I expect this company will reach new heights under his able leadership. So with that Wes, now over to you.
Wes Bush : Thank you very much Ron. Good morning everyone, my comments today will briefly touch on the operational highlights for the five businesses. Beginning with aerospace systems on slide four, we had a particularly strong quarter with 5% sales growth and 10.5% margin rate. Year-to-date sales and operating margin are on track with our expectations. Growth continues to be driven by restricted programs, unmanned aircraft systems like Global Hawk, BAMS the Navy UCAS and manned aircraft programs like the E-2D Advanced Hawkeye, B-2 and the EA-18G. Aerospace highlights during the quarter included the launch of two Northrop Grumman build demonstrator satellite for the Missile Defense Agency, space tracking and surveillance system. These satellites will demonstrate the inherent advantages space sensor ranked persistent missile tracking and engagement. This quarter we also concluded a serious of test that validated the design and structural integrity of the X-47B Navy UCAS. The test confirmed that X-47B meets the Navy’s requirements for a jet powered fighter sized aircraft to demonstrate carrier-based autonomous launches and recoveries. This is a major milestone in preparation for first flight later this year. Aerospace systems ended the quarter with a $25 billion total backlog, about the same as the end of the second quarter. New business in the quarter included, low rate initial production awards for the F-35 and Global Hawk. New awards for restricted programs, and several follow on awards for space and manned aircraft programs. On slide five, electronic system sales grew by 2%. You’ll recall the last quarter; we indicated their double digit growth phase would not continue in the third and fourth quarters. So this quarter sales growth is on track with our expectations. This quarter’s lower operating income and rate reflects the $40 million patent infringement settlement we had in the third quarter of 2008 and lower performance for government systems programs this quarter. Electronic systems remains on track to achieve a mid to high 12% margin rate for 2009. Ron mentioned some of the electronic systems third quarter program awards and at the end of the third quarter, ES had a total backlog of nearly $11 billion. Information systems on slide six had a solid quarter. Sales increased 4%, operating income increased by 32% and operating margin rate improved to 8.2%. Sales growth for information systems continues to be driven by growth in our intelligence and defense businesses. On a combined basis, intelligence and defense grew by approximately 7% this quarter and are up by more than 10% year-to-date. During the quarter our cyber security team is awarded the army information operation contract at Fort Belvoir, Virginia to provide secure and efficient network operations and to share information superiority. This contract has a ceiling of $430 million. We have also won five companies, the army selected to provide automatic identification technology hardware, software and engineering services. This contract has a maximum value of $419 million. Information systems total backlogs totaled more than $10 billion at the end of the third quarter. In our state and local business, we’ve made progress on the Beta program and we are on our way of putting the program back on track. In the third quarter we provided a corrective action plan to the commonwealth of Virginia. We’re working to that plan. For example, more than 80% of the transformation activity and more than 90% of contract milestones are now complete. In addition, we’ve instituted a number of improved processes for open and frequent communication between the partners. Northrop Grumman, VITA and the various agencies of the commonwealth to ensure rapid and effective resolution of issues. Our plan cost for completion of transformation activities by June 30 of 2010. We are confident that the corrective action plan is the path to success. Moving to ship building on slide seven sales increased 14% and operating margin declined 4% representing an operating margin rate of 6.8% for the quarter. Last quarter I outlined the components of the performance improvement plan that we’re implementing on the gulf coast. We are making progress in the implementation of the plan and while we still have work in front of us to fully implement it. We believe this approach will drive consistent sustained improvement on these large multiyear programs. Margin improvement in shipbuilding remained one of our largest opportunities to create value. Third quarter operating highlights in shipbuilding included the redelivery of CBN-70, the USS Carl Vinson after a successful three and a half year refueling a complex overhaul. We delivered two ships out of the gulf coast the DDG-105 or Dewey and the LPD-21, the New York. And our second national security cutter the Waesche successfully completed acceptance trials in October, marking the final test before delivery in November. And at the end of the quarter, shipbuilding’s backlog stood at more than $21billion. So all in all it was a pretty solid quarter for shipbuilding was stable performance. Moving to slide eight, technical services had another strong quarter. Sales increased 4% and operating income increased 5%. However, as Ron mentioned the real highlight for technical services occurred just after the quarter ended when it was announced that we’ve won the KC-10 contractor logistics support program. Coming on the heels of key A-10 and C-20 wins, this nine year $3.8 billion KC-10 competitive win demonstrates our progress in expanding our presence in the key logistics and sustainment market. We’re very proud of the technical services team and their success in capturing and executing new business. In summary, we remain intensely focused on managing risk, improving performance and driving growth. This quarter’s solid performance demonstrates that we’re making progress on all three fronts. And with that, I will turn the call over to Jim.
Jim Palmer: Thanks, Wes. Good morning ladies and gentlemen. My comments begin on slide nine and we will focus on third quarter performance, the expectations for the rest of 2009 and some thoughts on value creation on a go-forward basis. Overall, it was a good solid quarter with mid single digit sales growth, and a 9% segment operating margin rate. Although, not at our long term objective we view this rate as satisfactory at this point considering where we are in the improvement program at shipbuilding that Wes outlined. Earning per share of $1.52 were slightly higher than last year despite the negative year-over-year pension impact and quite a bit better than what you may have been expecting based on a consensus. The third quarter did include a $75 million tax benefit which improved earnings by $0.23 per share. Before that, our earning per share would be $1.29, a very strong performance considering the pension headwind we faced in the quarter. Net pension cost reduced third quarter EPS by $0.15 per share compared to a benefit of $0.13 in last year’s third quarter. So on a pension adjusted basis, our third quarter earnings per share increased by 22%. Based on year-to-date results, we are raising our EPS guidance to a range of $5 to $5.15 from the prior guidance range of 465 to 490. The reduction in third quarter segment operating income to 9% from 9.2% last year is principally due to the lower operating income for electronics, and the primary driver for lower electronics margin was the $40 million of royalty income associated with the patent infringement settlement that occurred in last year’s third quarter. We generally had solid or expected performance in the four other businesses. There are also some items below the segment operating income line that are worth noting. Unallocated expenses increased by $35 million and that increase principally relates to higher environmental accruals. This reduction was essentially offset by $41 million in other income. Now, other income typically includes a number of reoccurring items such as interest gain or loss on assets sold reoccurring royalties and returns on assets held to fund our nonqualified plans, in excess of the nonqualified plan expense. However, for the third quarter the largest item in other income relates to a gain of $18 million from a operating joint venture whose performance improved resulting in a recovery of a loan that we had previously reserved for. Turning to slide 10. Third quarter 2009 cash performance was strong; through the nine months before discretionary pension contributions we generated $1.8 billion in cash from operations and $1.3 billion in free cash flow which keeps us on track for our guidance for the year. On a year-to-date basis both cash provided by operations in free cash flow are slightly lower than in 2008, which principally reflects higher working capital needs as you all remember, we just had an outstanding working capital performance last year so that really is the change in the working capital. Year-to-date we have made discretionary pension contributions of $800 million which has turned out to be a very strategic use of capital. Through the end of the third quarter investment returns in our pension plans are about 13%. And at this point, I don’t anticipate any more discretionary contributions this year. Now I know all of you are anxious for 2010 guidance regarding the financial accounting or FAS and cost accounting CAS pension expense. But as you know, we really won’t have fidelity on this until the books are closed at the end of the year, and that the 2010 cost will be based on actual plan returns for 2009. The discount rate as of the end of the year as well as demographic and other assumptions. However, to help you think about trends for next year, our FAS expense sensitivities are about $35 million for every 100 basis point change above or below the 8.5% long term expected investment rate return. And then $75 million for every 25 basis points change in the discount rate. And based on what I see today, our pension position is relatively strong going into 2010, but it is too early to quantify our net FAS/CAS pension adjustment with any degree of certainty. At this point, it does look like investment returns relative to assumptions will be positive, however the discount rate could turn out to be a major driver for 2010 FAS expense for everyone with large pension liabilities. But, again, I believe our relative position is quite good. As you know, we’ve been very focused on managing our pension liabilities, I’m especially mindful of the potential growth in required funding that may occur in future years due to the magnitude of planned losses in 2008. Our goal in voluntary contributions is to reduce that volatility of those future funding requirements that would otherwise be associated with our plans and to better match the reimbursement for pension cost under our contracts over a multi year basis to our funding requirements. All done in a tax efficient manner while improving our cost competitiveness. So, even though the vast majority of our pension expense is recoverable through our contracts, we are striving to be as competitive as possible in an environment where the customer is becoming increasingly price sensitive. In addition to make in pension contributions we used cash to purchase four point million shares for approximately 227 million which leaves us, as Ron mentioned with about 280 million remaining in our current authorization. Year-to-date we bought about 15 million shares and since the beginning of 2007 we reduced our shares outstanding by about 9%. Turning to the quarter or doing the quarter, we also took advantage of favorable conditions in the corporate debt market and raised $850 million of long-term debt and we used about $400 million of that on October 15 to retire the 8% senior notes that matured at that point. So, in summary a good solid quarter. One in which we continue to focus on proactively managing risk and improving performance. Looking ahead, as you know we’ll provide specific 2010 guidance on our year end earnings call as our customary practice, but I do want to make the point today that we have substantial opportunity to create shareholder value. Even in a constrained budget environment where top line growth will likely slow we have a tremendous opportunity to improve profitability principally in ship building and in parts of our information systems business. Relative to our peers we should be in a good position regarding the net pension cost. We continue to expect that we will generate robust cash flows that should allow us to effectively manage our liabilities, fund share repurchases, increase the dividend and invest in the business. So, Paul, with that I think we are ready to turn it over for questions and answers.
Paul Gregory: Terrific. Lacy, if we could go to the Q-and-A session, that would be great.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.
Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo: Good morning. I guess the first question; I just want to confirm you didn’t mention anything about revenue or cash flow guidance for this year. I just wanted to make sure that has changed on that front.
Jim Palmer: Yes Sam, on cash flow nothing has changed. As I said, I think Ron tracked for that. In terms of revenue, at this point I’d probably be looking maybe at 34.9 versus 34.5, and in terms of how that might be reflected in the segments, I would think aerospace at this point is on the top end of the range, maybe even $100 million better. Electronics is probably in mid range in terms of the guidance, information systems is probably on the low end, shipbuilding is probably on the high end, maybe even a little bit better and technical services I would say is in the mid range.
Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo: Okay, and then can you just talk specifically about electronic systems, just if I look at Q2 to Q3, you had a sequential down tick in terms of sales and pretty I guess big change in terms of margin. I don’t know, is that some benefits that you had in Q2 or is there something else in terms of the mix in Q3?
Ron Sugar: In terms of sales, it really is just the timing of contracts and revenue recognition. As you might remember in electronics, that is the part of our business that has the majority or a large percentage of contracts that are accounted for on a units of delivery basis, and we traditionally find in the third quarter lower deliveries in that business. So that is one of the revenue impacts. In terms of margins, it really comes down to individual programs. As Wes mentioned we did, as our normal practice look at EACs on a number of our major programs. We did have one program that had some cost growth, and so we’ve also decided to add some additional time to the implementation systems for the system, so we reflected that in our cost assumption and adjusted earnings on that. Now, I think that part of those costs should be recovered from our customer, but since we are on the very front end of those kind of conversations, we reflected the cost in our assumptions, but we haven’t reflected any recovery in our EAC assumptions.
Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo: How big is that cost?
Ron Sugar: We don’t really talk about individual programs, but essentially as we said in the press release, again, on a year-over-year basis, the largest change in electronics was the one time royalty payment that we had last year. When you adjust for that, you had 11.7% margins this year versus kind of 12.4 last year, and I’m not really that significant I think in the overall margin trend.
Jim Palmer: Ron, I think you were continuing to support the projection for electronics for the year in the mid to high 12%.
Ron Sugar: And on a year-to-date basis in terms of earnings this year versus last year, the margin rate in electronics, again adjusting for the one-time royalties that we’re in last year is exactly right on top of each other at 12.4%.
Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo: Okay, thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein; please proceed.
Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein: Good morning. I’m interested in ship building. My understanding has been in the gulf, that you’re basically adding to the management team, you have been bringing people over from Newport News, and also putting operational metrics in place that perhaps are more rigorous than where they are before. Could you talk about how that process is proceeding where you stand now, and when you think you will be where you want to be in terms of having that organization and the management processes all set?
Wes Bush: Yes Doug, it’s Wes, let me kind of take you through that a little bit, and if you reflect back on some of my comments from the last quarterly call, I would say things are on track relative to what I delineated then, but if you would kind of turned the clock back a little bit it was the beginning of last year, the beginning of 2008 we announced that we were going to be integrating the two previously separate ship building businesses into our new ship building sector, with Mike Petters as our Sector President. Mike and his team went through a very thorough organizational process last year, during the year 2008, to identify the right organizational structure and then the right people to populate the structure. It did include moving select individuals from Newport News down to the gulf to take some of the key positions. It also included identifying many of the very, very capable leaders that we already had in the gulf for important positions in the new organizational structure. We largely went through that process last year, and at the end of the year if you look back on the senior leadership positions, about three quarters of the senior leaders were in different roles. So that was really our focus last year, making sure we had the right people in the right roles, and we continue of course as in any business we continue to fine tune that, but I feel good about the leadership profile in the Gulf coast operations. Getting that leadership team in place was critical, because as we have worked to define and now implement the new operating system with what you mentioned the metrics, but as or perhaps more importantly, a different focus on how we are actually managing the progress of construction. We wanted ownership, we didn’t want this just to be something that was invented at some senior level, and then new folks brought in trying to figure out if they could implement. Instead, we used the team that we have worked to establish last year, to together design and build this operating system, and really began I would say, the aggressive implementation of that operating system over the course of this year. As we did that, it reflected in changing the profiles for how we were getting ships done, we talked a little bit about that last quarter that those changes rippled through the schedules and costs and that showed up in our earnings in the first two quarters. That operating system, I went through it in some detail on the call last quarter in terms of the work that we’re doing with phase implementation plans or we are breaking things down in the finer gated decision blocks for each of the ships. It is taking hold and I would say that even though we are very early in the implementation of a very substantial change to the way we’re driving the operations. So far, the results indicate that it’s doing what we intended. The nice thing, the better thing I would say about this approach to running the business there is it really gives us earlier visibility of cost and schedule variations, and that gives us time to get out in front of those things when inevitable execution issues arise. I think the most important thing is the rigid adherence to this billed sequence that we defined in the Gulf, really drives problem resolution to the left in the process, instead of lighting things slip to the right and in aggregate and become bigger problems downstream. We’re also adhering to the class build plans that I talked a little bit about last quarter, and we are beginning to see that they really should drive substantial benefits and zero production. So I would give us the grade of in process right now. As we’ve been indicating now for some time, we need to get some runtime on this operating system, we need to iron out the bugs that inevitably arise, as you better connect the planning process with the program execution process, with the labor management process, all those different processes operating together in a system takes a little bit of time to wring that out, and it’s my expectations as we get into the early part of next year, we’ll be able to really give you some indication of the stability of what we have been able to accomplish for the operating system. So that might have been more of an answer than you wanted, but I thought it was important to take you through it since we are doing a lot of work down there.
Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein: No, that’s helpful and as the follow up, on the state of Virginia you talked about going to June 30, 2010 now as the target for this transition date. Now let’s say that happens; will you be able to basically work through that point, go into operation and feel that you’re not going to have to take a charge given that you essentially add the year to the entire development period for this.
Jim Palmer: Doug let me walk through wider a little bit, and as you know these large IT outsourcing programs such as VITA are essentially characterized by two types of risk. The first is the cost of transition from the old legacy competing environment to the new environment, and then once you have completed that transition, it’s the future revenue stream and the cost to provide that future revenue stream. And at this point in time the cost associated with the transition are being deferred, and then amortized against both current and future revenue streams. So at this point as Wes said in his comments, we’re about 80% complete with the transition, so a big part of it is behind us. We do have some agencies to complete, that will take us into a kind of mid next year, but we have made substantial progress on transition. We’ve been working diligently not only to complete the transition, but also to drive down the cost of providing the services that we performed currently, as well as in the future. We’ve made good progress on both of those, and for certain we do have to complete the transition, but at this point from my perspective, I see the largest variable in this equation to be the future net revenue stream, particularly in a budget constrainted economic environment as we are now experiencing. The key will be whether that future net revenue stream was sufficient to fully offset the unamortized transition cost, which frankly at this point, I think is probably at the high point. Clearly, we have some more cost to incur on transition, but we will also have some amortization, so I’m really looking at this point kind of in the water mark in terms of those unamortized cost, and so the key role, as I said that future revenue stream and whether it’s sufficient to allow us to recover those unamortized cost, and if it’s not, we could have some impairment of that unamortized costs, but the good news if you will, is that it’s a non cash item at that point.
Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein: You want to add much visibility into that it sounds like, until you get well into next year.
Jim Palmer: Well we clearly have a future revenue projection and a cost projection, and it’s based on what we see as the requirements and the need, based on the two years that we’ve been already providing services, but I think any of us in our own businesses only have to look at what happens to the appetite for IT services overtime. They tend to grow as apposed to shrink and so the key will be as I said, that future revenue stream in total over the remaining seven, eight years of the program. At this point, we feel pretty good about our forecast for future revenues and future costs, but it is as I said a variable.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of Myles Walton with Oppenheimer & Company
Myles Walton - Oppenheimer & Company: Hi, thanks and good morning. Ron it’s been a pleasure working with you in the last couple of few years, five years now. Wes, you are getting handed to the keys just as a spending cycle is kind of running on a gas, there is few ways you can mange a business in a constraint or maybe even declining revenue environment on the future. I’m curious, as you look out, do you anticipate shifting the company in terms of the way you will manage Northrop, whether that’s through acquisition, the best strategy, overall capital deployment or just your thoughts if there it will be a change and kind of where on the margin you anticipate that happening?
Wes Bush: Yes, thanks Myles. When we look at the environment, clearly at the national level there are different pressures today than there have been over the last few years. On the flip side of that, we all know national security spending is more responsive to what’s going in the world around us necessarily as to individual annual budget cycles and so we continue to see a lot of issues. In a broad sense when you think about global security, that the nation is simply going to have to address, and we’ve architected this company to be in an absolutely stellar position I believe, to address that global security challenges and more simply need to navigate our way through the budget issues over the next few years as we continue to expand our way of thinking about addressing those global security challenges. This is a great company. It has just a tremendous side of capabilities and I gave first Ron an enormous amount of credit for what he has done in assembling the capability that we have today. So I’m excited about the future, and now it’s not the time I would choose to go into lots of thoughts about all of the things that might be on our mind for the future, but I would that we believe we’re incredibly well positioned and it’s really up to us to take advantage of what we have in the corporation to fully address the emerging environment that we see in front of us.
Myles Walton - Oppenheimer & Company: And Jim, I guess on the 2010 outlook, I know you don’t want to talk too much about it, but given the moving parts in the portfolio, would you expect sales growth in ‘10 to be above or below what you are seeing in ‘09?
John Palmer: Myles, I’m going to wait till January, as is our traditional plan on guidance. We’ll just leave it at that.
Myles Walton - Oppenheimer & Company: All right, John.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of George Shapiro with Access 342. Please proceed.
John Palmer: Hello George.
George Shapiro - Access 342: How are you doing Jim? Lots of luck to you Ron after all these years, and good luck to you Wes.
John Palmer: Thanks George.
Wes Bush: Thanks George.
George Shapiro - Access 342: In shipbuilding, you said that you might be a little bit above the high end, but the reality is even if you did 59, you see a substantial drop in shipbuilding revenues in the fourth quarter, and usually the fourth quarter is your strongest revenue quarter. So could you kind of explain what’s going on there, or are you really going to be very conservative in terms of what sales are going to be?
Jim Palmer: Yes George, the variable always in these big contracts is the cost input at the end of the year. As you know we use percentage of completion; it’s based on cost, and so how much cost are you going to get from various suppliers is a key in determining the revenue forecast, so that’s the big variable at this point in time. We have a good handle obviously on how much labor we think we’re going to expand, but the variable is always that cost input from the supply community, and I wish it were easier to forecast than it is.
George Shapiro - Access 342: But Jim, as you go back to like the last three or four years, the fourth quarter revenues have been traditionally the highest of the year. So I was just wondering what in the mix of business might be substantially different this year that would cause this year’s fourth quarter to be a lot less than the highest of the year.
Jim Palmer: George it really is just that cost input that as I said it occurs in the quarter, and when I look at the fourth quarter, you are right, this quarter is above that forecast, but the fourth quarter for example is above the first quarter. So there are quarterly variations in the revenue dependent upon that cost input, variability that goes with the various programs.
George Shapiro - Access 342: Okay, and then one quick follow up; have you seen any difference in terms of the F-35 sales projection that you are looking at over the next several years?
Wes Bush: No, not from what we can see at this point George. We make our own assessments of that in our long range planning. We obviously take into account what we believe are the budget plans, and also frankly the realities we’ve seen over the years of the inevitable changes in the production quantities and what have you, but we’re not seeing any changes from our planning standpoint.
George Shapiro - Access 342: Okay, thanks very much.
Wes Bush: Thank you, George.
Operator: And your next question will come from the line Joe Campbell with Barclays Capital. Please proceed.
Joe Campbell - Barclays Capital: Hi, good morning and I’d like to echo everybody else’s sentiments. Ron we are going to miss you. Good luck in whatever you choose to do and Wes I don’t know about an MIT guy running a California company, but best of luck.
Jim Palmer: Well I can thank you Joe, he may not.
Joe Campbell - Barclays Capital: I have a kind of bean countered question about cost accounting standard outlook. I know the FAS is pretty volatile with all these discount rates and lots of variable, but what’s the outlook for the way the ability to build the pentagon is going to go under the class of accounting standard, and if you have any update on what it is that the government is doing under the PPA mandated harmonization of CAS and FAS that would be great as well?
Wes Bush: Okay, good questions Joe. On CAS harmonization, well let me backup. First of all PPA is a funding mechanism which really drives how much we have to fund into our plans. It has nothing to do with FAS or CAS.
Joe Campbell - Barclays Capital: Except that there is the PPA mandates, that cost accounting board to harmonize the PPA minimums in CAS?
Wes Bush: So we had essentially as I said three requirements or three regulations, FAS, CAS and funding. You are correct, that there is a move under put to try to harmonize CAS to PPA. It’s unclear exactly what that will mean. I don’t expect that it will mean they will be exactly the same. The industry saw a draft of proposed CAS harmonization about a year ago. We’ve made some comments to that and we haven’t seen anything since then. So at this point as I said, we saw a draft a year ago. That draft as I said, partly closes the gap between what PPA would require you to fund and what you are reimbursed under your contracts for under cost accounting standards, but it does not entirely close the funding or the difference in funding in CAS. Exactly where it will end up is kind of anyone’s guess at this point in time, until we again see the next version of the proposed regulations. I do think it’s fair to say George or Joe, that the CAS harmonization should result in an acceleration of the recovery of cost under the cost accounting rules, but again, I don’t expect that it will be fully on top of the funding requirements.
Joe Campbell - Barclays Capital: Okay, and what about what’s going to happen to CAS in say, ‘10, ‘11, ‘12?
Wes Bush: Well a lot of variables, but I think probably the best way to talk about it is to hold all the variables constant. So if I hold investment returns at 8.5%, the discount rate constant all the other assumptions essentially, I’ll talk about what I see for FAS or CAS or the net FAS/CAS difference and then for funding. If I look at 2010 and ‘11 for example, I would expect that FAS expense stays relatively constant. Some fluctuation around $850 million number, essentially where we are for 2009, but with some fluctuation around that, maybe a $20 million type number. The net number, net FAS/CAS number I think in 2010, under that set of assumptions improves maybe $50 million bucks and improves more in 2011, significantly more and that is without a CAS harmonization assumption. When I look at my funding going forward, under that set of assumptions, I’m fairly confident that my recoveries under CAS would exceed all of my required funding amounts for 2010 and ‘11 and if I chose to do voluntary contributions, let’s say at the same combined level as I did in 2009, I still ought to be somewhat cash positive from total recoveries versus total funding. So that’s kind of how I see that landscape at this point in time, but as I said in my prepared comments, there is a whole lot of variables at this point in time, and I only have point to last year, that these calls last year where some of us in the industry were projecting kind of 7.5% discount rate, and when we got the year end and it was back down in their low sixes. So there can be a lot of variability between now and the end of the year frankly, both in discount rates and potentially in investment returns, although we have had a good market so far this year.
Jim Palmer: But it sounds like under most circumstances your CAS is going to be big enough, so you’ll recover everything you have to put in and CAS is rising, so whatever. When FAS just feels like let’s say staying the same, it could also rise, but in any event, whatever pension shortfalls they are it feels like in your case at least the government will be providing, sounds like all of the funding, and on an improving and accelerated basis without harmonization, and with harmonization it would be even better.
Wes Bush: I think that is a fair assumption.
Jim Palmer: I know what you can’t know what the discount rates are going to be, so terrific thanks very much and good luck to everybody.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Please proceed.
Wes Bush: Hey Howard
Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Company: Good afternoon gentlemen. You’ve been pretty straight forward with your share repurchase program and you continue to have a fairly conservative balance sheet. Is there an effort here to change the debt to capital ratio, and now that you have completed some of your near term funding requirements on the debt side?
Wes Bush: No, I don’t think so Howard. We are continuing to manage balance cash deployment. What you see is what you get, and these days it’s not a terrible thing to be a little conservative.
Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Company: No, I appreciate that Ron. Then just to follow up a little bit on the conservative side, it appears as if two of the more highlightable contracts that have now been put into the marketplace, the LCS rebid and the tanker, both have fixed price elements to it. Could you explain how you’re going to run the business or operate it, so that the risk isn’t unmanageable?
Ron Sugar: Let me take a first cut and probably more important here is what Wes has to say, but LCS we’re not directly playing in that at the moment. Tanker, obviously on that when we have a competition underway we have an RFP on hand, we are evaluating the draft RFP which has certain conditions in it, and we are in the process of having our discussions with the government, so it would be pretty immature for us to say much about that. I will say overall though, as we look going forward, we have to be extraordinarily mindful of the risk reward for all contract bids, and if we see conditions and terms that don’t make a lot of sense for us on some future opportunities, we will look at those very carefully before we would actually go bid them or we bid them on conditions we felt would be sensible for our shareholders. I think that’s the way we are approaching it, and frankly I can’t speak for the whole industry, but I’m certain that other folks have similar views.
Wes Bush: Yes Howard, its Wes. I guess the thing I would add, and just to amplify really what Ron was saying, we certainly intend to be very disciplined in our approach to this market place. All of us have lived through the other side of this experience on fixed price contracting and so, some major investments were made, and we hope to learn from those investments if you will. What I would also though say, and I think it’s important part of the thought process here and as we work to engage with our government customer; I think there is a good understanding or an emerging understanding that fixed price doesn’t really bound or appropriately manage risks for the government in all cases, particularly when you are talking about the development side of things. When I asked the contractors to fix our pricing, and there is a reasonable expectation of volatility of requirements or of funding profile or other types of external inputs beyond what the contractor can control. The contractor has to price that risk, and he has to price the risk in a more conservative way than the government should be able to price that risk, by managing the risk appropriately on their side. So my outlook is to the extend that we see the inappropriate use of fixed price activities, spike in development where true development to be done, the government is going to find itself actually paying more to get things done, because I believe as an industry not just Northrop Grumman, I think as an industry we are generally much more disciplined about our approach to pricing risk today than the industry may have been a decade or so ago. So I think hopefully we will able to gender the discussion with our customers. That really reflects that reality of how risk has to be priced. If they are try and put it all the way over on the shoulders, the contractors who really don’t control the majority of the sources of volatility.
Ron Sugar: And again Howard, I think that this differentiating of fixed price development is a different animal than fixed price production; for something the government we know exactly, out of bill. Again fixed price production contracting has often turned out to be a win-win, and it’s usually a win-win, particularly with multiyear funding, and we’ve been very pleased with many of our multi year fixed price production contracts. They give us better margins, better predictability. It’s the development that is more problematic.
Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Company: I mean Ron, like F18 is a great example on that end, but I just am concerned that the government doesn’t understand that you don’t repel the law of physics by this thing on it. I mean, the two of you should know that better than anybody.
Ron Sugar: Well again Howard, you run experiments till you show to yourself that it doesn’t work.
Wes Bush: You said it well Howard.
Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Company: All right, thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of Kai Van Ruhl with Cowan & Company, please proceed.
Kai Van Ruhl - Cowan & Company: Yes, let me share the nice comments for Ron.
Ron Sugar: Thanks Kai.
Kai Van Ruhl - Cowan & Company: Well done. Hey Jim a question. You gave us the sensitivity to cash to the P&L, but what is the sensitivity to the pension benefit obligation of a 25 bid swing approximately?
Ron Sugar: Kai, as I remember, a 25 bids swing on the obligation side on the discount rate is $700 million.
Kai Van Ruhl - Cowan & Company: Okay, which would say that even if the discount rate is down 50, is 50 bips lower, it would look like your total pension benefit under funding at the end of the year given the good performance should be comparable to the end, what you had going into the more or less slightly better discount rates or closer. Is that a fair guess?
Ron Sugar: Yes, I would say today being 9:30, with no change in assumptions and then the actual performance, we essentially cut in half the under funded situation in the plan at that point in time. Now if discount rates move by 25 basis points, as you suggested that affects that funded amount by that roughly $700 million for every 25 basis points. But I think as I said, given the performance in the plan, as well as our funding situation this year, at the beginning of the year, we had roughly $3.6 billion unfunded situation and at the end of September, that’s probably a little bit under $2 billion. So, really good progress, both from a contribution side, as well an earnings side.
Kai Van Ruhl - Cowan & Company: Right, so to my point in terms of forgetting exactly when you are required to put the money in via Alissa harmonization, you are going to be relative, if you kind of hit your 8.5%, you probably don’t have to continue to fund at the levels you did in 2009, it looks like.
Ron Sugar: My required contributions, under those scenarios that I talked about would Joe, 8.5% no change in discount rates, my required contributions next year at this point are probably a $100 million.
Kai Van Ruhl - Cowan & Company: But forgetting your required, if we think out over four to five years, you’re under funding situation, its really not that bad, because at some point I think everything is (Inaudible). So it’s not like you are having a great big monster there.
Ron Sugar: I agree with you, as you know, in our investor conference, we had a chart in our presentation, which essentially showed that our funded situation was the best of the major peers. I think we’ve only added to that situation as we’ve gone through the year.
Kai Van Ruhl - Cowan & Company: Terrific. Thanks so much.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of Robert Bengon with Credit Suisse, please proceed.
Robert Bengon - Credit Suisse: Ron, let me echo the comments, congrats on the retirement.
Ron Sugar: Thanks Robert.
Robert Bengon - Credit Suisse: A couple of things; Jim, you talked about segment guidance from a revenue perspective and I think that Wes talked about electronic systems; anything else that you can add for us just going to the final quarter from a margin perspective along the segments?
Jim Palmer: Yes, Rob the best way for me to think about segment operating margin at this point is, I’m nine months into the year. I look at my nine month rate and I think my year end rates are going to be kind of 10 or 20 basis points around, we’ll have that for nine months. I think it all stays as opportunity to do a little bit better, I think electronics as well, ships I am expecting a 5% margin, but essentially from a individual segment, I would look largely at where I am at today and then I am going to have a little bit of fluctuation around that for each of the segments.
Robert Bengon - Credit Suisse: Okay, and then more specifically couple of things, first of all on the KC-10 sustainment, no one’s protested that at this point.
Ron Sugar: Well, right now we are not aware of any protest. There was one other competitor, we will wait and see as the period expires and deal with that when it comes.
Robert Bengon - Credit Suisse: Okay, and then with the two satellites that you delivered in the quarter, the STSS satellites you talked about earlier, does that present any kind of revenue headwind in the next year in aerospace?
Ron Sugar: Actually this year well it was a fairly low burn rate on those satellites because it was primarily wrapping up for delivery and time spent at the launch site, so no, we really don’t see that as a headwind for us.
Robert Bengon - Credit Suisse: Okay, and then just the last thing on the ship building side, there’s been talk about the submarine program and some issues there on the welds and so forth, where does that stand, and are there forward issues?
Ron Sugar: We really don’t see those as forward issues for us. I give a lot of credit to the New Port News. Whenever there is anything on the quality issue, they jump on it very aggressively and very transparently, a very open engagement with the customer. We are making very good progress on repairing the issues that you have seen reported that had been found. I don’t see that impairing our ability to meet our delivery commitments and more importantly, I think we feel that the customer is pleased with the aggressive approach that we are taking to both identify and resolve the issues, as well as our approach to continuous improvement to make sure our processes preclude future or currents of similar issues. So I see us making good progress there.
Robert Bengon - Credit Suisse: Okay, and then I guess one last one, Wes or Ron, is there anything coming up in the next quarter or two from an award perspective that you would want us to focus on?
Ron Sugar: Well, I think we did mentioned in my initial remarks. Kanes, OCX are two examples of that. Anything involving refueling tankers is obviously way out, probably into the latter part of the next year, but what is interesting is that while we don’t see that many competitive awards up for grabs in the next couple of quarters, we do have a very, very robust amount of follow on business to existing contracts, and frankly that’s very good business for us, because that’s business we get from performing well. A good portion of our backlog as you know, probably the overwhelming majority of it for the next year is pretty much already in the $71 billion that we have got now. So nothing else that I can think of off the top of my head if you guys have any other ones. Lots and lots of little ones; literally 1000s of individual awards, but nothing that would kind of rise to a big or shattering opportunity.
Robert Bengon - Credit Suisse: Okay. Well, thanks very much.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of Joe Nadol with JP Morgan, please proceed.
Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan: Congrats to both of you guys as well from my end, and that’s actually my first question; is during the transition process over the next two and change months, could you give us a view into what you guys are doing differently from last month or two months ago, how are you handling the transition. Then any thoughts on the sustainability or the duration of the split CEO Chairman role? Is this like a one year thing? is that the anticipation here or is it undetermined?
Ron Sugar: Well Joe, one thing that I think is pretty evident is that we take management succession very seriously here at Northrop. We have been involved in this for quite a number of years and the board has obviously been very much involved in it. So, I would say that what you are seeing is the combination of a gradual process, in which management duties have been shared and expanded. Wes and I as I think has been obvious to most of you have been running this place as a team. So I wouldn’t think for the last two and a half months you are going to see a whole lot different. Obviously, with the future commitments we are talking about and some of the future issues Wes, what needs to take the lead there because he owns them, but the official change of command will be at the end of the year. As far as the split Chairman CEO role, the board has always at Northrop reserved the right to make the decision that is appropriate for the company at the time. In this particular case, that it was the boards’ decision that the split role would probably be the right way to go and that will be the way we’ll go, until the board makes a decision to change that.
Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan: Okay, and then second question is for Jim, just on the cash flow. So just to be specific, I know you said that we are still on track. The guidance you had given before was $1.9 to $2.4 free cash flow before pension, that’s now 800, so am I correct in saying it’s after pension we are talking about $1.1 to $1.6?
Jim Palmer: Yes, some tax effects on that the benefit of the contributions, but yes.
Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan: Okay, and then on the working capital use this year, $400 million it looks like to date. Where do you anticipate finishing the year on that and how much of that is VITA for any other big specific pieces?
Jim Palmer: Almost as hard as projecting the supplier cost input at the end of the year is the cash collections. You might remember Joe at the beginning of the year, we talked about not having the working capital performance in 2009 that we had in 2008. I did expect that it would be negative. I still expect that it would be negative. However, I am also mindful of our organizations zeal for going out and collecting cash at the end of the year. It is something as I think you know is part of our annual incentive, and so there is a clear incentive on the part of the management team to go get as much cash as we can and so at this point in time, the guidance is the best number I have. As you said the $400 million down are working capital to-date. My guys, our guys are going to be really incentivized to bring that number down. I don’t think we’ll bring it totally down to zero.
Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan: Are you seeing Jim, any changes in the collectability of some of these things; is it getting tougher? It just seems like the working capital, maybe is going to the other direction for several companies and maybe it was last year, two years three years ago.
Jim Palmer: It is getting tougher Joe that the industry as a whole has had some issues with electronic billing and DCAA audit of electronic billing, which has resulted in some delays in collection. Obviously we still collect, it’s just how soon. The industry is dealing with that situation right now. It has been a drag this year on collections.
Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan: Okay. Going forward you don’t really have a sense as to whether that’s going to persist in the 2010 yet, it’s my guess?
Jim Palmer: Collectively the industry has an issue, there has been a change in approach by the DCAA on electronic billing and we are trying to resolve it, but it’s not resolved yet.
Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan: Okay. Thank you guys. Congrats again Ron.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of Robert Stallard with Macquarie, please proceed.
Jim Palmer: Okay. Rob, this is supposed to be our last question.
Robert Stallard - Macquarie: No problem, I’ll just keep it quick. Jim on the ship building you had commented three months ago that you said there was a risk of further operating charges, they haven’t mentioned that today. Has this situation changed, do you think there is now a lower risk of having to take further cumulative cash term adjustments there?
Jim Palmer: Rob, I would say as Wes said, we are in the middle of this transitioning to the new way of managing the business, the metrics, we are in the midst of that. I don’t think I would say it’s any more or any less.
Robert Stallard - Macquarie: Okay. Best of luck for the future Ron.
Ron Sugar: All right.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question and answer portion for today. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Wes Bush for any closing remarks.
Wes Bush: Thank you, Lacy. Before we wrap up the call I want to thank you all for joining us on Ron’s last conference call. I know I speak for everyone at Northrop Grumman, when I thank Ron for his leadership during an absolutely critical period of integration and growth for our company. Now on a personal note, I am telling you it’s hard to express how much I’ve sincerely appreciated Ron’s trust and his guidance. I know that many of our employees are listening in on today’s call, and I certainly know I speak for all of them in wishing Ron the very best. So thank you Ron, and thanks everybody for joining our call today.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today’s conference. This concludes your presentation. You may now disconnect. Good day everyone.

Operator: Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Northrop Grumman second quarter earnings conference call. My name is Glenn and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. (Operator instructions). I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today’s call Mr. Paul Gregory, Vice President of Investor Relations at Northrop Grumman. Please proceed.
Paul Gregory: Great, thank you Glenn. Good morning everyone and welcome to Northrop Grumman’s second quarter 2009 conference call. In support of today’s call, we’ve provided supplemental information in the form of a PowerPoint presentation that you can access at www.northropgrumman.com. Before we start, please understand that the matters discussed at today’s call constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities Law. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which are detailed in today’s press release as well as our SEC filings, and may cause actual company results to differ materially. During today’s call, we’ll discuss first quarter 2009 results and guidance for the year. We will refer to non-GAAP measures, which are defined and reconciled in our earnings release and supporting materials, which are posted on our website. On the call today, are our Chairman and CEO, Ron Sugar; our President and COO, Wes Bush; and our Chief Financial Officer, Jim Palmer. Please proceed to slide three. And at this time, I would like to turn the call over to Ron. Ron?
Ron Sugar: Thank you Paul and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us. My comments will address our second quarter results, year-to-date cash deployment, guidance for the year, the market environment and our new business pipeline. Overall, our portfolio performed well in the second quarter. This quarter’s results reflects higher pension costs as well as the aggressive actions we are taking on the Gulf Coast shipbuilding programs to improve performance. Year-to-date, we are on track and we are confirming our 2009 guidance. On a consolidated basis, second quarter sales grew by approximately 4%. Year-to-date sales have grown by nearly 6%, led by our highest margin business electronic systems with second quarter sales growth of 18% and a year-to-date increase of 17%. At the midyear mark, we are on track to achieve our sales guidance of $34.5 billion for the year. Operating performance is in line with our expectations for the year. At our May investors conference, we indicated that we might have additional bumps in the road in shipbuilding, which were considered in this year’s EPS guidance. Second quarter results for shipbuilding reflect the cost to drive continuing improvement in our Gulf Coast operations. Wes will provide more insight into our improving actions shortly. While GAAP EPS shows a year-over-year decline, principally driven by the change in the net FAS/CAS pension expense, our pension adjusted EPS increased 7% to $1.36 versus $1.27 last year. As I said on last quarter’s call, pension adjusted EPS is a better measure of our underlying operating performance. On a year-to-date basis, our pension adjusted EPS of $2.68 is 40% higher than last year. We are confirming our 2009 GAAP EPS guidance of $4.65 to $4.90. Cash from operations in free cash flow were solid, allowing us to continue executing our balance cash deployment strategy. During the quarter, we increased our dividend by 7.5% and we repurchased nearly 5.8 million shares of common stock. Year-to-date, we repurchased nearly 10 million shares, leaving us with a remaining authorization of slightly over $500 million. For the year, we continue to expect cash from operations of $2.7 billion to $3.2 billion and free cash flow of $1.9 billion to $2.4 billion, both of which are before $500 million of discretionary pension plan contributions. New awards for the quarter totaled $7.5 billion and this doesn’t reflect potential backlog and revenue from large ID/IQs such as the A-10 program, the Technical Services won this quarter and the VIS-X program that Electronic Systems won. These billion dollar plus contracts have minimal initial impact to new awards and backlog, but will generate income as we receive task orders. Year-to-date, we have booked nearly $15 billion in new awards, which is consistent with our expectation for the timing of awards this year. Total backlog at the end of the second year was slightly more than $70 billion after adjustment for the KEI termination. Looking ahead, Northrop Grumman continues to be strongly positioned for a future national priorities. We have a robust opportunity sets that includes near-term competitive opportunities like the Navy’s CANES acquisition, the Air Force’s GPS OCX contract, the Navy – the Army’s Aerial Common Sensor and of course the Aerial Refueling Tanker. Looking at the defense and national security spending environment, the administration has made some definitive program decisions in their 2010 budget proposal and now Congress is weighing in. The quadrennial defense review and the FY ’11 budget processes are well underway. The results of these efforts will give us a better understanding of the administration’s longer-term priorities and plans. It will be a balancing act between addressing dangerous national security threats and fiscal spending constraints. We believe that there will be strong demand for Northrop Grumman’s products and services in this evolving national security environment. These include unmanned aircraft led by Global Hawk, BAMS the Navy UCAS program and Fire Scout. Manned aircraft with continuing production of the F/A-18 and growing production of the F-35 and the E-2D Advanced Hawkeye, there will be electronic sensors, C4ISR, and other intelligence capabilities and finally hybrid security solutions. In summary, our primary focus continues to be on reducing risk, improving performance and positioning for growth. We believe we continue to have tremendous value creation opportunity for our shareholders. And now before I turn over the call to Wes for additional discussion on Northrop Grumman’s operations, let me mention that this month marks the anniversary of two very important historical events involving our company. 40 years ago, the Grumman Lunar Module safely transported humans to and from the surface of the moon. And 20 years ago, the Northrop B-2 Stealth Bomber made its first flight, dramatically advancing America’s global strike capability. The 120,000 men and women of Northrop Grumman make enormous pride in the contribution that this company has and continues to make for our nation. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Wes.
Wes Bush: Thanks Ron. Good morning, everyone. This quarter the company demonstrated solid operating performance in our Aerospace, Electronics, Information Systems and Technical Services sectors. As we described at our investors conference a couple of months ago, we are in the process of making major improvements to our operating approach in our Gulf Coast shipbuilding operations. This quarter, we have reflected cost impacts on the LPD and LHA programs that result from the deliberate actions that we are taking to drive improvements in our Gulf Coast design, engineering, production and quality systems. The changes we are making began with an absolute commitment to the quality of the ships that we are delivering from our yards. Over the past several years, we have experienced a series of quality related issues with related financial impacts and all of the changes that we are making from design and engineering through production and testing are grounded in a firm commitment to product quality. This means that some processes will cost more than when they were initially estimated. For example, we have instituted a 100% inspection regime on piping and electrical work and we will maintain this degree of quality oversight until we have objective evidence that our manufacturing and production processes warrant a reduced inspection approach. But the implications of these fundamental commitment to quality go far beyond inspection. We have implemented a shorter cycle build sequence management approach for all of the programs in the Gulf. Every major program phase is subdivided into shorter phases, each with strict entry and exit gate criteria that must be reviewed by management. This approach forces strict management decision making on each sequence of the build cycle and it drives work to be completed within its defined phase of the sequence. This approach should dramatically reduce the downstream impact of quality issues and the related rework implications, a progressing work that is not ready to move to the next step. The process of changing the program execution plans to this new approach will illuminate actual cost and schedule variances earlier in the program lifecycle than would have been visible in the prior production system. Incorporation of this management approach has increased the EACs for all of the LPDs that we have under construction. This gated decision making approach also includes assessments of engineering readiness. In fact, our cost growth on the LHA 6 is driven by our assessment that we need to delay the delivery schedule on this ship to enable the engineering work products to reach a higher degree of completeness before moving into substantial production. In addition to our commitment to quality, we have also transformed our operating approach to build our program execution around class build plans that enables a full benefit of serial production. We have also instituted improved production management tools that provide an increased visibility into the impacts of labor resource sequencing across the entire Gulf Coast operations. These changes taken together have resulted in substantially improved execution plans for the ships under construction in the Gulf. The increased costs of these plants are reflected in the charges taken in both the first and second quarters. We have now reviewed all of the major Gulf Coast programs. Although, we may still have challenges on these multiyear programs, we have taken a big step forward in managing future program risk and variability. A changed process of this magnitude is a marathon, not a sprint and we expect there may be additional challenges as we are now with this new operating system. But we expect to begin to see reduced variability in our program execution as we proceed into next year. The bottom line is that we are taking deliberate and proactive steps to improve performance and predictability in the Gulf. Our 2009 guidance contemplated the potential for additional risk on the Gulf Coast and we are on track to achieve this year’s guidance for the company. As a management team, we are committed to proactively managing risk and getting out ahead of issues, both operationally and financially. We are positioning Northrop Grumman to power through program challenges while continuing to deliver solid financial results. There were several key deliveries and milestones our shipbuilders achieved this quarter. We delivered the George H. W. Bush, the nation's newest and most advanced nuclear powered aircraft carrier. We also delivered the Makin Island under LHD 8, which by all accounts is getting very positive reviews from our service men and women. The Aegis-guided Missile Destroyer Dewey, the DDG 105, successfully completed her combined super trial on the Gulf of Mexico, paving the way for delivery for the Navy later this summer. And on June 27, the USS New York or LPD 21 built with steel from the World Trade Center was put to see for builder ship trials. We are confident that despite our challenges, we have an incredible amount of opportunity here to improve returns as we turn this business around. So now let’s talk about the operational performance of our other businesses. Beginning with Aerospace on slide five, we had another strong quarter with solid 8% year-over-year sales growth and a strong margin rate. Growth continues to be driven by our industry-leading position in UAVs, our position on mature manned systems like F/A-18, E-2C, Joint STARS and B2 and the transition to production on programs like the F-35. We also saw solid growth on our restricted programs. During the quarter, we delivered the final center fuselage for the SDD phase of the F-35 program and we delivered the first center fuselage for the production phase of the program. We also introduced the Black 40 Global Hawk and we delivered the first center an aft/fuselage for the F/A-18F Super Hornet for the Royal Australian Air Force. Another highlight was the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite which was launched by NASA in June and is well on its way to collecting data that will indicate whether there is water on the moon. Looking forward, Aerospace Systems backlog remains robust at nearly $25 billion. New business award highlights included the $432 million award for the E-2D Advanced Hawkeye production as well as the key win of the Navy’s Maritime Laser Demonstration program. This is an important Northrop Grumman technology that we hope to leverage for future growth. One slide six, Electronic Systems posted another truly outstanding quarter with 18% sales growth and 25% operating margin growth. We continued to see strong demand across the board for our electronics products. New business capture during the quarter included a $400 million follow-on award for Sivers, as well as the competitive $2.4 billion VIS-X ID/IQ win for our joint venture with Cobham. One of the losing VIS-X competitor subsequently filed a GAO protest and the GAO has until October 28th to issue a decision. Information Systems on slide seven had a solid quarter, particularly in the area of new business and positioning for growth. For the second consecutive quarter, we had terrific revenue growth in our intelligence and defense businesses, 15% and 10% respectively, while maintaining operating margin rates. The growth in these two core businesses reflects our strong position in the ISR and cyber security markets. Sales for state and local programs declined, which reflects the wind down of programs like New York City Wireless and a more disciplined approach to new business pursuit in this market. The Virginia IT outsourcing program, or VITA, has been in the new quite a bit recently. As we have executed the transformation program, it has become clear that the scope of the effort is substantial greater than initially planned. We are working closely with the Commonwealth to address growth in contract scope and to improve the working relationships with the many state agencies involved in transformation, some of whom have previously been reluctant to engage in the transformation effort. While transformation is not yet complete, we are making progress and many agencies are already enjoying the benefits of working in this new environment. The new business outlook in IS remains excellent. In June, the Air Force awarded Northrop Grumman, a $276 million contract for a fielding and operational deployment of the Battlefield Airborne Communications Node, or BACN, an airborne communication system that provides war fighters with critical, real-time battlefield information. The tasking includes installing BACN on two Global Hawk Block 20 unmanned aircraft. There are also several major opportunities that IS is pursuing including GPS OCX, CANES and ACS. Moving to slide nine, second quarter performance in our Technical Services sector was very strong with double-digit sales growth for the second consecutive quarter. A highlight for the quarter was being one of three contractors selected for the A-10 Thunder Bolt lifecycle support contract. We continue to weigh the Air Force award of the KC-10 contract or logistic support contract which is now expected in the fall. So in summary, my key operating priority is superior execution across our 20,000 programs and we are taking the deliberate actions that are necessary to improve performance across all of our businesses. And with that, I will turn the call over to Jim.
Jim Palmer: Thanks Wes. Good morning ladies and gentlemen. My comments focused on the second quarter performance and our guidance for 2009. As both Ron and Wes have mentioned, overall, it was a solid quarter. The quarter of our aggregate results somewhat mask by the aggressive actions we are taking in the Gulf. We had excellent sales and income performance particularly in Aerospace, Electronics and Technical Systems. And what I would characterize is essentially on plan performance in Information Systems. Based on our year-to-date results, we are on track to meet our overall 2009 guidance. I continue to be pleased with our top line performance. All of the sectors with the exception of shipbuilding had positive sales growth for the quarter. Information Systems grew at 3%, but I want to reiterate what Wes said about the combined growth rate for our intelligence and defense business. These two businesses combined grew in the range of 12%, much higher than the overall growth rate of IS, all while maintaining their margin rate in the combined businesses. The demand for our core operands in these markets continues to be strong and demonstrates the strength of our defense and intelligence position. The consolidated growth rate does include lower state and local revenue in keeping with our more selective approach to that market. Second quarter fully diluted GAAP EPS decreased by $0.19 from 2008. However the primary driver of the EPS decline is the year-over-year change in net FAS/CAS pension cost, which totaled $145 million or $0.28 a share. Pension adjusted EPS increased by $0.09 or about 7%. And year-to-date, our pension adjusted EPS is up 40%. The other EPS drivers for this quarter were the $0.21 shipbuilding charge and the $0.13 legal gain. Second quarter operating income was 8% compared with 9.1% last year. The reduction is primarily due to the shipbuilding charge, so without the shipbuilding charge, segment operating margin rate would have comparable to last year, reflecting the strong performance in the rest of the portfolio. We did have strong margin performance in Electronic Systems, Aerospace Systems and Technical Services. In Information Systems, margin rate was a bit lower than last year, but that is primarily due to the lower margin rates in the state and local programs that were recognized in the prior year period. Turning to slide 10, second quarter 2009 cash performance was strong. And we are right about where I expected to be through the first six months. And on the year-to-date basis, both cash provided by operations and free cash flow are comparable to where we stood at the six month mark in 2008, one adjusted for this year’s discretionary pension and pre-funding contributions. Collections were strong this quarter and we made good progress in improving our working capital from where we stood at the end of the first quarter. And as I said last quarter, I expect that 2009 cash from operations will be once again weighted towards the second half of the year and I again would remind you that our cash flow guidance for 2009 is before the discretionary prefunding of our pension plans. We continued to execute our cash deployment strategy. Ron mentioned the share repurchases that we made this quarter, 5.8 million shares that have cost of about $273 million. And on a – and we have about $500 million remaining on our current authorization. We also continued to effectively manage our liabilities. In the first quarter, we made a discretionary pension contribution of $214 million and in July, we contributed an additional $286 million with obviously will be reflected in third quarter results. By making these discretionary contributions, we are reducing future funding demands and building on our industry-leading pension position. Now let’s move to guidance for the year which remains at $4.65 to $4.90 on a GAAP EPS basis. When we established our 2009 guidance, we clearly communicated that we considered risk and opportunities in establishing that guidance. For example, a potential shipbuilding charge in the magnitude of the second quarter charge was considered in our overall corporate level guidance. Looking ahead, we still have risk and opportunities. Clearly there are some areas where operational performance can be improved essentially reducing ongoing risk, particularly in the Gulf and on the VITA contract. These are the remaining no one operational risk have been considered in our overall guidance for the year. The actions and associated charges we took in the Gulf in the second quarter have reduced our sales expectations for shipbuilding to the lower end of our lower guidance range we provided in May and I now expect a margin rate of about 5% for shipbuilding for the year. Until we consistently see the benefits from the operating system we have put in place in the Gulf, some operating risk remains. However, on a longer-term basis, a turnaround of these operations represents our biggest opportunity. On VITA, Northrop Grumman and the Commonwealth of Virginia are working to resolve contract requirements growth to reduce cost and to complete the transformation across all of the agencies. We anticipate that these effort will succeed, but if we aren’t able to make substantial progress on these fronts, there is some financial risk on the contract. As the management team, we continue to be keenly focused on aggressively addressing risk and proactively managing it as we go forward rather than taking a wait and see attitude. I should also mention that there are opportunities that we have considered in our guidance including the continued strong operating performance particularly in Aerospace and Electronic Systems as well as the potential for lower tax rate this year. So in summary, a good quarter, one in which we continue to focus on proactively managing risk and improving performance. Paul, I think with those comments, we are ready to turn it back over for Q&A.
Paul Gregory: Very good. Thank you, Jim. Let’s go ahead and begin. So Glenn, if you could queue up some questions.
Operator: (Operator instructions). Your first question comes from David Strauss from UBS. Please proceed.
David Strauss – UBS: Good morning.
Ron Sugar: Good morning, David.
Wes Bush: Good morning, David.
David Strauss – UBS: Look, Jim – looking at your sales guidance, it looks like that you are assuming flat to slightly lower sales in the second half. Is that right? And if so, what’s driving that?
Jim Palmer: Good morning, David. Essentially the strong – really strong sales growth that we have seen in electronics for the first half of the year, I don’t know that – I expect to continue at about the same level. If you look at last year, we had very strong sales growth in Electronics in the second half of the year which continued into the first half of this year and then into the second half of next year, so – second half of this year. So essentially, we are catching up with the growth that we have experienced last year and continuing into this year and then continuing for the balance of the year, but the rate of growth will slow.
David Strauss – UBS: Okay. And then on, by segment, I have been hearing updates in terms of your margin guidance and specifically looking at ships I think you had said previously that 7% will be a good performance. Obviously with the charge now, it is going to be tough to get there. What should we kind of look for out of ships on the margin side for the full year now?
Jim Palmer: Yes, David, maybe I have missed it in my comments. But I had about a 5% margin rate for shipbuilding as my thoughts about guidance for them for the balance for the year.
David Strauss – UBS: Okay. I made a mistake. I apologize. And then Jim, just an update on pension, kind of year-to-date performance and maybe if you could some sort of – some sort of help in terms of how we should think about it for 2010.
Jim Palmer: Through June, we are positive to 2%, 2.5% and that kind of range in terms of pension performance as – so that the issue is essentially in thinking of that pension expensive in 2008 go to performance on the plan and about a 100 basis point move in performance versus the 8.5% long-term assumption is about kind of $35 million impact on 2010 expense. And the other big variable is the discount rate and a 25% -- a 25 basis point rather move in the discount rate generates about a $75 million change in pension expense. So if I would have look at where we were at the end of June, 2.5%, because there is some exposure to expense in 2010 based on the variance between 2.5% and 8.5%. And likewise the discount rate, if we were setting rates at the end of June, we probably move up 25 to maybe even 50 basis points in terms at a discount rate, so that tends to offset some of that variability. But essentially as you know, all of this is conjecture at this point, we set the number at the end of the year based on actual returns and actual discount rates at the end of the year.
David Strauss – UBS: And then (inaudible) you are just speaking from the FAS side, right?
Jim Palmer: Right.
David Strauss – UBS: All right. Thanks.
Jim Palmer: Yes, all right.
Operator: The next question comes from Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo. Please proceed.
Sam Pearlstein – Wells Fargo: Good morning. Wanted to some kind of dig into ships a little bit more, I think Wes at the analyst meeting you talked about that after going through the performance this year you hope to have the business in shape going into 2010 to be stable as you exit the year. I guess, one is, do you still feel that way? And then if I look at just this quarter ex the charge, you are doing margins on the order of 7.8%. So trying to figure out why we are not going to see that kind of performance even in the second half of this year.
Wes Bush: All right, Sam. Let me talk a little bit about first your question on the timing the stability. And – as we said at the investors conference and the story is still the same that we are working hard to drive these improvements in our Gulf Coast operation. It really does take a little bit of time to change the processes that we are utilizing that really mirror a lot of the very successful processes that we have instituted in programs where we have real class build activities underway like Virginia class. And I do continue to expect that it will take us through the reminder of this year to really get these new operating systems ironed out and up and running and I think it will be into the beginning of next year before we can really make that solid assessment on stability. But as I said in my remarks, we do see the actions that we have taken here in the first two quarters is a big step forward in driving that stability, ironing out the variability and really getting our arms around the risk profile. But I am still in the same place I was at the investors conference. And then with respect to the margin rate, I think Jim addressed that very directly with respect to what our expectations would be for this year. Overall, our booking approach in ships, I would characterize as a more conservative booking approach and we are not at a point of giving an outlook on that for next year quite yet. But I think you will continue to see us reflect that more conservative style and the way that we are thinking about our programs in the Gulf.
Sam Pearlstein – Wells Fargo: Okay. Thank you. And then just a follow up with Jim, if sales for ships are going to be towards the lower end of the range and the margin is going to be about 5% I guess. Can you talk about the other segments in terms of what’s going to be the offset to that in order to continue to hit the overall sales and the earnings guidance?
Jim Palmer: Sam, as I said in my closing comments, I expect continued strong performance out of both Electronics and Aerospace in particular. In terms of margin rate and I think our range had been – guidance range had been mid-to-high 12%. I feel good about where they are in terms of ability to meet that guidance range. In Aerospace, about 10% has been our guidance and again I feel good about that. There maybe a little bit of upside to that depending about the various programs for the balance of the year. But essentially that’s the swingers as I look at the balance of the year.
Sam Pearlstein – Wells Fargo: Okay, thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Doug Harned from Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed.
Doug Harned – Sanford Bernstein: Good morning.
Wes Bush: Good morning, Doug.
Jim Palmer: Good morning, Doug.
Doug Harned – Sanford Bernstein: On ships, Wes, when you walked through some of the things that you intend to do, the improvement in processes and taking some of the lessons learned from Newport News to the Gulf. I am trying to understand how they get confidence in there. And Mike Petters has been leading this organization for about a year-and-a-half now and you’ve brought in Irwin Edenzon, have you brought in other people from Newport News. In other words, how are you getting the talent leadership in there to make sure that these kinds of changes and really take hold?
Wes Bush: Doug, it’s – we talked a little bit about this in the investors conference, but I think it’s probably an appropriate time to give a little bit of a broader perspective. We have been making changes across the board in the Gulf Coast operations and it’s of course much more than Mike and Irwin Edenzon, although it’s critical of course to have the right leadership at the top to really drive the improvement programs and I am very pleased with the work that both Mike and Irwin doing in driving. But beyond that, we have restructured the overall leadership approach, both organizational structure in terms of how we are driving the programs as well as the functional organization and the people. And if you look at the top player management, these changes have impacted about 75% of the senior management positions in the Gulf Coast and that means both the arrival of talent from outside of the Gulf Coast as well as the redeployment of some really good leadership talent that we have in the Gulf Coast. So it’s been a restructuring of the approach that that we are taking. Those – that set of change has really occurred over the course of last year as we were getting our arms around how we wanted to execute the business and restructure the operating approach and getting those people in place, getting the organizational approach in place last year. They have enabled us to use that team to define this operating system that I was just describing earlier to really move out and implement this little bit different way of doing business. And so we not only have a team in place, we have ownership of what we are doing that I think is just going to be absolutely critical to the success for making progress. You asked about how can we tell if we are making progress, we are going to be talking to you about this every single quarter, you can bet on that as we go forward. But beyond, obviously our communications with all of you, I am spending a lot of time on this, Jim is spending a lot of time on this in detailed reviews both at the program level as well as I would say some other leading indicators that we look at in terms of the front-end work and the quality indicators. One of the things I talked about at the investors conference was the time it takes to really turn things around in a broader quality perspective. And it’s reflected a lot in the changes that we are making on this, driving the rigid adherence to sequence controlling the programs. When you think about where we are on many of the programs that are reflected in the charts that we took in the quarter, many of those activities have a status of production that’s well downstream. And so issues that may have been manifested by virtue of earlier decisions on sequence control, we are having to work our way through those today with the team is in place. And so we have got a little bit of work still in front of us to really get our arms around all of those activities and get them operating the way we really wanted to operate. So it’s a – it is a tops to bottom set of changes that we are making and I feel very good about the progress, but again, Doug, we are going to be talking about this every quarter, because we understand that it’s an area of intense interest to many of you and you need to see the progress as well.
Doug Harned – Sanford Bernstein: And I want to ask a follow-on on IT, I just can’t, I mean the LHA 6 is, I mean this – this – you were cutting metal of the beginning of ’08 when you made the management team, so this one doesn’t have to seem as much legacy issue in it.
Wes Bush: Yes, Doug, the focus on LHA 6 has really taken a lot of the lessons learned from a number of programs including LHD 8, where it’s very clear that we need to make sure that the engineering products are at the level of completion that enable us to move in to substantial production with confidence that we are not going to be having to rework as we finish up some of the other engineering activities. Earlier this year, when you said cutting metal, we were at a very, very low level of early production. So this is the right time to really drive home the engineering completeness before we move out.
Doug Harned – Sanford Bernstein: And then on – on VITA, you talk about – you talked about two issues, one, contract requirements growth and then, getting a better relationship with the agency in the state. But if you look at the issues that have come up earlier in the audit and a lot of the things that have been politically charged I would say within the State of Virginia, those don’t appear in the service of me at least to be contract requirements growth, a lot of them are back to this building the relationship with these agencies and the difficulty it appears that you have had in getting traction with those agencies and that may not be at all your fault. But you have had a fair amount of time to be down there. I mean how do you see this unfolding? What can you actually do to get the agencies on board, make sure you are going to be paid and then how much risk is associated with this if that doesn’t work out until right at the transition?
Wes Bush: So, Doug, let me give you a perspective on VITA that I think is difficult to get from media reports. Media reports give you a very narrow window into a view of a program of dis-complexity. They’re really usually focused on quotes from individuals that are looking at the program in a certain way.
Doug Harned – Sanford Bernstein: Well, I am talking about – also the transcripts of hearings audit documents.
Wes Bush: All right. So let me give you a broader view. We’re undertaking in Virginia a major IT transformation activity that spans across many, many different agencies, each with their own operating culture, each with their own history of how they have used IT systems. And as you think about the cultural complexity of going through that amount of transformation, there are a lot of human dynamics involved in it. And so separating the issues out into narrow buckets of, well, this was a building issue or this was a issue around inventory, they turn out to be highly interrelated. Where we see the status on the program and the issues on the program, be very direct about it, there is a lot of issues to go around. We’ve not been perfect in our execution and we’ve had a number of issues and working this with the state and the variety of different agency involved. And we are having to work the resolution of all of these things very closely with the Commonwealth, despite perhaps the negative tone that shows up in many of flash to your media reports. And we see this on a path of constructive resolution. But it’s going to take more than just Northrop Grumman doing all the things that we can do to make this work right. As you know, there has been a fair amount of recent attention by the General Assembly, I guess that is called and the Governor’s office highlighting the fundamental governance challenge, given that VITA reports to an Independent Board and various agencies that are undergoing transformation, all have very different reporting structures. We are glad to see that getting highlighted. We think it’s important that that issue get out on the table and it gives us some confidence that the governance will get addressed as a part of the overall resolution in getting to closure here. So there are contractual changes that need to occur, there are governance changes that need to occur and there is programmatic changes that need to occur. And we are working all of those fronts to make sure that we get there. The issue obviously is getting through the transformation phase and migrating into the ongoing managed services phase. That’s going to take a little bit longer to get through the transformation phase. We are working with the state to define that timeline. But from what we can see so far at the working level of all the folks that we interfaced with, there is a recognition that we got to work this together to get it done. It’s the best interest of the state; it’s the best interest of the company.
Doug Harned – Sanford Bernstein: And can you dimension the risk on this as you see it going forward?
Wes Bush: It’s a contract like any other contract, we – if you’ll think about it broadly, we have gone through our thought process on the range of risk we have contemplated that in our guidance approach. So I wouldn’t try and quantify any particular contract risk as we typically don’t do that with others.
Doug Harned – Sanford Bernstein: Okay, well, thank you.
Wes Bush: Thanks Doug.
Operator: The next question comes from Joseph Nadol from JPMorgan. Please proceed.
Joseph Nadol – JPMorgan: Thanks, good morning.
Wes Bush: Hi Joe.
Joseph Nadol – JPMorgan: Wes or Jim, could we walk through four different programs, I am sure you know which ones they are already. And just go through the contract types and where we are if they’re fixed price, are we in a loss position, just to help us gauge maybe a little bit more carefully what the incremental risk might be. DDG 51 which you were clean on this quarter, but you had charges last quarter, obviously the LHA 6, LPD 17 and then VITA?
Wes Bush: VITA is essentially, we characterize it as a fixed price contract. The fee for service rates are determined, then so the key will be future revenue streams resulting from volume compared to actual cost of providing that – DDG 51s are fixed price incentive, LHA 6 is a fixed price incentive, and I forgot the fourth one Joe.
Jim Palmer: LPD.
Wes Bush: LPDs.
Jim Palmer: Fixed price incentives.
Wes Bush: Fixed price incentives.
Joseph Nadol – JPMorgan: So all three of the ships are fixed price incentives. Are there any kind of cost shares in any of those are they simply just –
Wes Bush: No, they’re a – fixed price incentive means that there is a incentive sharing of cost above or below a target cost to a point of ceiling or total assumption.
Joseph Nadol – JPMorgan: Right. So is there any share left on any of those three, are we in the 100% fixed price mode at this point?
Wes Bush: On depending upon which ship, so each of these are essentially different contracts. There is not one contract, for example, for LPDs. There are a series of contracts for LPDs. So depending upon which ships there are – some cases, essentially fixed price. In other case, they are fixed price incentive with ceiling production still remaining.
Joseph Nadol – JPMorgan: Okay. So there is no way to characterize which we have more room to go on – on generally speaking – and do you have a multiyear on DDG 51 anyway? Is that really more than on contract?
Wes Bush: No, we are under contract for the two remaining ships, DDG 51s to be delivered. One off – I guess it’s three. 105 is being complete, it’s on its sea trials, 107 and 110.
Joseph Nadol – JPMorgan: Okay. And then – just in that, you mentioned tax rate Jim, you may have opportunity there. What’s embedded in your guidance right now and has that changed and how much opportunity in there?
Jim Palmer: Actually Joe, in the Q, we disclose that there is the potential for about $50 million reduction in taxes this year as a result of – if we are able to bring the closure, the resolution on an IRS dam. That equates to about $0.15. And I thought about my risk and opportunities, I weigh both the risk and opportunities and come up with that overall range.
Joseph Nadol – JPMorgan: Okay. So it’s factored and maybe partially is the way to think about it.
Jim Palmer: Yes.
Joseph Nadol – JPMorgan: Okay. All right, thank you.
Jim Palmer: Thanks.
Wes Bush: All right.
Operator: (Operator instructions). Your next question comes from Howard Rubel from Jefferies & Company. Please proceed.
Howard Rubel – Jefferies & Company: Thank you very much.
Ron Sugar: Good morning, Howard.
Howard Rubel – Jefferies & Company: Gentlemen. Thinking about the cash deployment and what you’re going to do all the opportunities. Do you – as you look out, do you just continue to see the best opportunity as share or continue to do balance of share repurchase and dividend increase. And where do you think you would look for an optimal capital structure, because clearly, you are in a great position today relative to where you have been?
Ron Sugar: Howard, let me kick that off. This is Ron. And first of all, we are interested in building this company and building the shareholder value with it. We do have the balance cash deployment strategy we have been very faithfully executing probably for the last five years or more. And we have, you are correct, put ourselves in a very strong balance sheet position, strongest in our company’s history actually. We see balance to deployment with share repurchase dividend increase, capital investment. As we have also stated at the investor conference, we are on a look out for opportunities to improve our portfolio where we see opportunities, particularly in areas that we have discussed such as C4 ISR, cyber, unmanned, and things that we think we are going to be faster moving currents in the future defense environment. We have been pretty disciplined to this point in time. As you know, we are going down a few of these things a year, they have been fairly small. But the ones we have done we think have had significant impact, for example, the scale composites and the SX. So looking forward, I would expect, Howard, not see a whole different strategy, I think more of the same to some extent opportunity driven with discipline. But we like where we are sitting and we like the options we have. Jim, do you want to add anything on –
Jim Palmer: Ron, I just confirm your comments and confirm that we are happy with our balance sheet structure, capital structure today. We think it’s really important in today’s economic environment that we have the capital structure that we do have. We expect to continue with the rather conservative capital structure in today’s economic environment. I really don’t see a change in our balance cash deployment strategy on a go-forward basis, so continued investment in the business, whether through acquisitions or CapEx, balancing or managing the liabilities, funding the pension plan and returns to the shareholders will be primary emphasis as we go forward.
Howard Rubel – Jefferies & Company: And then just one follow-up. Ron, I am sure you really enjoy getting deep inside the head all the time by all these great shipyard questions. Is there a real consideration at some point, because you do characterize the rest of the portfolio is really being very good and results really standout. I mean, like we are in a business sometimes for managing portfolios to of – you know where this is going. Have you – have you – the thought about saying, you know guys, if you don’t ship up; we are going to ship you out. And put something there that’s a real metric and I mean, I know this is a quarterly call as opposed to a strategic discussion, but there sort of comes a point where you got to realize that how many times do you want to get surprised.
Ron Sugar: No. Well, Howard, obviously this is a portfolio and we are where we are at this point in time. Our focus is pretty much on fixing the business we have. We see this as the most significant improvement opportunity for shareholder value. That’s what we are focused. Obviously from time-to-time, we always consider future options to the company. We don’t comment on those publicly. But our focus is on improving shipbuilding. And I would point out that the surprise question, we did contemplate this in the guidance at the beginning of year. Jim Palmer and Wes and our team took a careful look of where we thought we would be. We wanted to make sure that we provided you an overall assessment of what your investment we will be able to do this year. We put the guidance forth on that and that’s where we are today. And as you pointed out, every business has portfolio issues from time to time. We were pleased with the over performance we are seeing in several of businesses and we are going to work as hard as we can to make sure they are all extended over time.
Howard Rubel – Jefferies & Company: All right. I can see, I am not going to get a complete answer on it, but I understand it.
Ron Sugar: Thanks Howard.
Operator: The next question comes from Brian Ruttenbur from Morgan Keegan. Please proceed.
Brian Ruttenbur – Morgan Keegan: Great. Thank you very much for taking my question. I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about revenues and margins broken out between the next two quarters, for third quarter and fourth quarter, if you can talk a little bit about revenues and margins and walk us through how you get down to earnings for the next two quarters?
Jim Palmer: Brian, we really don’t go through quarterly forecast. We’ve never have given guidance on a quarterly basis in the past and I don’t think it’s a good practice to start that at this point.
Brian Ruttenbur – Morgan Keegan: Okay. Is the third – the fourth quarter is going to be weighted heavier than the third quarter like we have prudentially seen?
Jim Palmer: What am I going to say? I just said, I am not going to give quarterly guidance.
Brian Ruttenbur – Morgan Keegan: I was just digging trying it from a different angle and okay. Any expected charges in your guidance that you have for the next two quarters?
Jim Palmer: Brian, as I said, I look at the risk and opportunities, I weigh them and come up with the overall guidance and I am comfortable with that $4.65 to $4.90 GAAP earnings per share guidance.
Brian Ruttenbur – Morgan Keegan: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question comes from Cai von Rumohr from Cowen & Company. Please proceed.
Cai von Rumohr – Cowen & Company: Yes, excuse me, if this has been asked. I was on another call. But have you talked about pension, your pension performance year-to-date and any kind of color on how we should think about pension next year?
Jim Palmer: Yes, I did have a few comments. But I know it’s an important topic that all of you are interested in, so let me just repeat. Through the – through June, we have pension returns in the – about 2.5% range for the six months. As you know, our long-term earnings assumption is 8.5% and every 100 basis point move or difference between our actual and that long-term rate of return assumption is about a $35 million impact on 2010 FAS expense. Likewise, discount rate has an impact. The two biggest impacts on going forward, pension cost or the discount rate, and the actual versus the long-term rate of return assumption. If we were looking at discount rates at the end of June and setting discount rates then, we would probably have an increase in the discount rate by 25 to maybe even 50 basis points. A 25 basis point move in the discount rate is about a $75 million change in the 2010 FAS expense. So those are kind of the broad parameters at this point in time. And again, we got six months to go, none of these rates are established until the end of the year, it’s actual 2010 investment performance and actual discount rate at the end of the year that establishes what the FAS expense will be in 2010.
Cai von Rumohr – Cowen & Company: And what’s your strategy in terms of pension contribution?
Jim Palmer: We, as you know, I think and we have disclosed a – obviously, we fund the required amount of pension plans and we had planned for another $500 million of discretionary contributions, all of which have now been made, we made $214 million in the first quarter and then in my comments, I mentioned that we made the balance, the $286 million shortly after the beginning of the third quarter here, so that will be reflected in the third quarter results.
Cai von Rumohr – Cowen & Company: Okay. Terrific. Thank you.
Jim Palmer: Thanks Cai.
Ron Sugar: Thank you, Cai.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ron Epstein from Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.
Ron Sugar: Hello Ron.
Ron Epstein – Merrill Lynch: Hi, good afternoon. Just to kind of beat the same dead horse here on shipbuilding. Ron, when you look back at that business, and really what’s been the biggest challenge in terms of getting it right, right? I mean it seems like it’s been a bit of bugaboo to get it to where you wanted to be and what’s been the biggest challenge?
Ron Sugar: Well, Ron, first of all, let’s partition the business. This business comes in two pieces, one is the Newport News piece, which is focused on nuclear shipbuilding carriers and submarines and the other piece and roughly divided in half is in the Gulf Coast building surface combatants and amphibs. I would say that the experience at Newport News since the acquisition of that piece of the business has been very solid. We have seen good performance there. It has in all businesses there are some cycles, but in general, there has been a higher level of predictability there both in terms of the products of the demand curves that’s come from the customer and our ability to put in place the kind of processes and quality methods that are needed for those kind of ships. In the Gulf Coast, we have seen a much different situation. We have seen a number of very extreme exogenous issues coupled with some internal issues. Exogenous issues have been a very dramatic variability in the predictability of the actual demand of ships down there both in terms of numbers, the different kinds of ships, the number of first-of-class ships that have been required, the number of the schedule those ships in the funding. Of course, the hurricanes have been just significantly disruptive and much more so than I would say than any of us including I really ever realize. And then I would finally say that, our experience has been to a maturity level of some of the processes and systems at the Gulf, even prior to the hurricanes and prior to the volatility in the demand, market demand have not been in the same level as we have seen in Newport News. So we made the decision, as you know, a year-and-a-half or two years ago, to put the businesses together, a combined management. We have a superior shipbuilding management team running this business. We are putting the right talent where we needed. As Wes indicated, we have made significant changes and structure process and people. This is long-cycle business. It’s going to take a while to work our way through this. But we do believe that with some stability in the shipbuilding plan and we have some reason to believe there could be some of those coming forward and the ability to get some traction as we are going, we should see a tremendous shareholder value improving opportunity over the next couple of years.
Ron Epstein – Merrill Lynch: Okay. And then maybe more specifically on the Kinetic Energy Interceptor, with that program effectively going away, does that open up other opportunities for Northrop in terms of what’s going to replace it?
Wes Bush: Yes, Ron. There is a very, very serious mission requirement in missile defense to hit enemy missiles early after launch before they are able to get too far down range and deploy potentially multiple warheads or do maneuvering. So if you don’t want to hit in the boost phase, that is when it’s powered, you do want to hit in the ascent phase shortly after the engine cuts off. And we believe that Northrop has a very significant set of expertise in terms of the command and control of a system that would do that. I think Missile Defense Agency is now contemplating perhaps a different interceptor vehicle, but that is only one piece of the overall system. The challenge is as much related to the sensing and the command and control and directing of the interceptor as it is in building the interceptor. So as the Missile Defense Agency develops its next steps here, we will be working with them very closely.
Ron Epstein – Merrill Lynch: And when would you expect us to get clarity on that?
Wes Bush: We are kind of watching the system develop. I am sure sometime in the next year that’s going to start sorting itself out.
Ron Epstein – Merrill Lynch: Okay, great. Thank you.
Paul Gregory: Thank you. I think we are ready for one more question and then we will be out of time. So last question, please.
Operator: The last question comes from Robert Stallard from Macquarie. Please proceed.
Robert Stallard – Macquarie: Good afternoon.
Wes Bush: Hi, Rob.
Robert Stallard – Macquarie: Hi, just a quickie, on your service side, haven’t you seen any delays in funding for any of your programs due to the change in administration?
Ron Sugar: Not due to the change at administration, Rob. But we have seen a long protraction in the award of a number of very large competitive logistics and support contracts. For example, the C-20 program which we had won and went into protest and the KC-10 program which is very large. KC-10, as you know, is one of the two tanker types which is currently being flown by the fleet and we are in a competition for that one and the competition down select date continues to ship to the right and does have some impact in terms of our ability to forecast, hopefully improved revenues and margins there. And we are a pretty much at the mercy of the procurement process for that.
Robert Stallard – Macquarie: Okay. And just quickly on the UAVs, Ron, you mentioned this is an area of potential growth going forward. How has your performance been versus cost and execution and timing on Global Hawk and BAM so far?
Ron Sugar: I think they’ve been very good. There was a little bit of buzz in the process probably about six months ago about, some concerns about Global Hawk and it was unfortunate that it was a letter that related to issues that were at probably about a year-and-a-half or two years old. The fact is that the – the operational performance of Global Hawk in combat has been outstanding. The demand for the system with additional sensors on the airplanes has been very, very strong from the operational commanders. We have a very, very good production line going now. We are off to a very good start on BAMs, so I think this is a very good program. One of the challenges we’ve run into with our partners the Air Force has been their ability to schedule adequate test time for the machines as we take them off the assembly line, but we are working with them to accelerate that process. But overall, this is a program, which has enormous impact for the future and one I think we are making very progress on.
Robert Stallard – Macquarie: That’s great. Thanks very much.
Ron Sugar: Okay. Well, very well, let me just wrap up the call then by just reiterating, it was a solid quarter overall. We had very strong performance in four of our five businesses. We are taking aggressive actions in the Gulf Coast and we appreciate your interest and concern there and we will keep you posted every quarter after this on how that’s progressing. We do see this as our most significant opportunity to improve shareholder value. But if I step back from that, our overall strategic position as we see the emerging defense budgets, we believe is strong and we think that we are going to be well set in the future environment. So I would like to thank all of you for joining us. And we will talk to you next quarter.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today’s conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Good day.

Operator: Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Northrop Grumman First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. My name is [Francis] and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question and answer session towards the end of this conference. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today’s call Paul Gregory, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.
Paul Gregory: Great, thank you [Francis]. Good morning and welcome to Northrop Grumman’s first quarter 2009 conference call. We’ve provided supplemental information in the form of a PowerPoint presentation that you can access at www.northropgrumman.com. Before we start, please understand that matters discussed at today’s call constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities Law. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which are detailed in today’s press release and our SEC filings, and may cause actual company results to differ materially. During the call we’ll discuss first quarter 2009 results and 2009 EPS guidance. We will refer to non-GAAP measures, which are defined and reconciled in our earnings release and supporting materials, which are posted on our website. On January 7th, we announced a realignment that impacts several of our businesses. The realignment is reflected in our first quarter 2009 results and we have provided a schedule in our press release that presents historical results in the new structure. On the call today, are our Chairman and CEO, Ron Sugar; our President and COO, Wes Bush; and our Chief Financial Officer, Jim Palmer.  Please go to slide three. At this time I would like to turn the call over to Ron.
Ronald D. Sugar: Thank you, Paul. Hello everyone and thanks for joining us this morning. Northrop Grumman is off to a solid start in 2009. Sales increased 8%, segment operating income is substantially higher, and GAAP EPS from continuing operations increased by 54% to $1.17 per share. For the first quarter, our pension adjusted EPS totaled $1.32 per share versus $0.64 last year. As I said on last quarter’s call, for 2009 earnings we think that pension adjusted EPS is a better measure of the operating performance of our five sectors. Therefore we will also be providing pension adjusted metrics throughout the year.  In addition to significant year-over-year improvement in shipbuilding due to last year's charge, all five of our businesses generated higher sales and operating income. The major EPS drivers were sales, operating income, and reduced share count due to our continuing share repurchases. Based on our outlook for the rest of the year, we are increasing our GAAP and pension adjusted guidance for 2009 EPS. We now expect GAAP EPS of $4.65 to $4.90 and pension adjusted EPS of $5.30 to $5.55.  Turning now to backlog, it was a solid quarter for new business awards. Following the fourth quarter record in new awards, we captured more than $7 billion in new business awards in the first quarter of this year, and we maintained a very robust backlog of $77 billion. We had many operational successes in the quarter highlighted by LHD 8, which we delivered to the Navy last Thursday meeting the milestone schedule we laid out for you last year. We also redelivered the USS Toledo submarine and accomplished a delivery of our 400th fuselage section for the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet for the Navy. For the Army, we provided the 500th Command Post Platform shelter system. We also delivered the payload for the third Advanced Extremely High Frequency or AEHF satellite. Shortly after the end of the quarter, we reached settlement on two significant legal matters. This joint settlement ensures to capture a present value on our long-standing TSSAM claim against the United States government, and at the same time removes the risk overhang on the company from the government’s microelectronics claim. The values assigned to each claim offset each other. Now, I would like to take a moment to comment on the new administration’s stated budget priorities for 2010 and beyond. We believe that Secretary Gates’ 2010 budget proposal represents a good starting point for this year's Congressional Budget deliberations. While we don't have clarity yet on many details, we believe that Northrop Grumman is very well aligned with the priorities that Secretary Gates outlined on April 6, and that the administration had previously articulated. First, no major prime Northrop Grumman programs were recommended for cancellation. Just as important there will be greater emphasis on areas where Northrop Grumman has extremely strong positions. We’re well positioned to support emerging initiatives in cyber security, intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance, command, control, and communications, and in unmanned air vehicles. We also remain well positioned on F-35 and other key programs, such as the Air Force’s aerial refueling tanker.  We look forward to responding to the Air Force’s forthcoming tanker RFP, and competing again for this program. As we have said before, we believe the most capable, best-value tanker won the competition last year, and we expect to win again. Regarding shipbuilding, while there are a number of puts and takes, Secretary Gates clearly understands the need for industrial base stability. We believe the swap of the DDG-1000 and DDG-51 destroyer work is a good outcome for all parties. We look forward to finalizing the contractual details this year.  We believe the swap supports our strategy to improve shipbuilding execution by allowing us, and the Navy to capture the value of serial production of ships in economic order quantities. Bath Iron Works will now become the prime yard for all three DDG-1000s and Northrop Grumman will continue to perform significant work share on the program. We will provide the composite sucker structure; the composite hanger and the peripheral vertical launch system for all three ships. The swap also supports stable continued construction of the LPD class. We will have more detail for you on budget implications for Northrop during our upcoming Institutional Investor Conference to be held at our electronic systems facility in Baltimore on May 5th.  So, in summary we are off to a strong start. Our focus continues to be on reducing risk, improving performance and positioning for growth. And our strong financial position allows us to continue to execute our balanced cash deployment strategy. Now, I'll turn the call over to Wes, for an additional discussion on Northrop Grumman’s operations. Wes?
Wesley G. Bush: Thanks, Ron. Good morning everyone. Overall the company is performing well. This quarter we had strong performances from information systems, aerospace, electronics and technical services, and where we continue to have program risk, primarily in ship building and information systems, management is keenly focused on retiring it. Beginning with Information Systems on slide four, much of the heavy lifting associated with combining the former IT and the MS sectors is now complete, and Linda Mills and her team are moving out aggressively. The combination of these businesses into one market focused enterprise benefits us in many areas, particularly in cyber security. The majority of our cyber efforts are now centralized under one management umbrella, which will enhance our business capture efforts in this growing market. Information systems had a strong quarter for both sales and margin, led by growth in the intelligence business, which was partially offset by lower state and local business. As we mentioned in our fourth quarter call, we except to see lower sales this year in state and local, as we are now approaching this market on a much more selective basis. Our state and local watch list programs continue to perform within their EACs and we’ll continue to focus a great deal of management attention on them as we move forward. Information systems continues to have a rich opportunity set, as our capabilities in this sector align particularly well with the emerging global security needs in both cyber security and C4ISR. During the quarter we received an increase to our contract sealing for the Blue Force Tracking system. The Army increased the contract sealing from $574 million to $908 million. A validation of the positive impact this product is having on the Army’s efforts to address new irregular warfare challenges. Moving to Aerospace Systems on slide five, we’re also very pleased with a successful standup of the aerospace system sector. The combination of our airborne and space capabilities is impressive, and it positions us well for integrated ISR activities across the aerospace continuum. Sales growth continues to be driven by unmanned platforms, restricted programs and manned platforms like the F-35. Operating income also remains strong. There were several program highlights this quarter. We delivered the third advanced EHF Military Satellite Communications payload. This delivery was ahead of schedule and it marked the third second consecutive early delivery of advanced EHF hardware and software. And I would add that we’re expecting that two more payloads will be required for this program.  Shortly after the end of the first quarter, we accomplished a successful ground systems test for the KEI program, and we also demonstrated the nation’s most powerful electric directed energy laser. On slide 6, Electronic Systems also had an outstanding quarter with double-digit sales growth and solid growth in operating income. We continue to see strong demand across the board for our products as demonstrated by this quarter’s 16% sales growth. The strong performance we’re seeing is a result of focused efforts over the past two years on sharpening our business development, by extending our products on to new platform types and moving our sensor technologies into adjacent markets.  We also continue to make good progress on watch list programs. On Block 60, in the first quarter, we completed a flight-testing of our most recent software delivery, and we’re working the updates generated during that flight-testing. We’ve one more key software delivery to complete the Electronic Warfare Capability. This team is focused on executing the closure plan and delivering a very capable weapon system. Regarding Wedgetail, ground testing has been completed and [antenna] range testing is approximately 60% complete. Formal aircraft ground testing started in the first quarter and we had our first flight test on April the 1st.  Looking at Electronic Systems overall, as the sales growth and margin rate indicate, we are performing very well. We look forward to seeing many of you at our investor conference in May, where we’ll provide a more detailed look at this business. Now, I would like to move to Shipbuilding on slide seven. We achieved our first quarter LHD 8 milestone with the completion of successful acceptance trials. And now that the ship has been delivered, our second quarter milestone is also complete. Based on the success of the first quarter acceptance trials, we were able to recover some of the previous provision for the ship. Offsetting this were EAC adjustments on the DDG-51 program and on the LPD 22 Expeditionary Warfare Ship. The adjustments reflect cost growth due to substantial out-of-sequence work on these ships, as well as, the transfer of craft personnel from these ships over to LHD 8 and the DDG 103 prior to its first quarter delivery. We have learned a lot of lessons over the last 15 months from the LHD 8 experience and the consolidation of the shipyards. Our Gulf Coast shipyards are most successful when we have serial, uninterrupted production. Key to success in this environment is a class build plan that has followed rigorously, so that every ship in the class is built in the same manner, with discipline, completion of planning packages to minimize out-of-sequence work, and a 100% quality inspection in critical areas such as pipe and electrical. These are the actions that we are taking across all of the ships in process on the Gulf. The DDG swap is well aligned with these objectives and it facilitates what we are working to accomplish at the Gulf coast. We have more to do to improve our processes and results, and until we see sustained improvement and efficiencies, we plan to take an approach to the Gulf Coast fee booking rates that more fully anticipates the risk profile, particularly early in the design and build base. Moving to slide eight, first quarter performance in our technical services sector was very strong, with double-digit growth in both sales and margin. One of the primary drivers for sales growth was higher volume for Hunter logistics, our program to operate, maintain, train, and sustain the multi-mission Hunter unmanned aerial system and to deploy Hunter support teams. So, in summary, as I said last quarter my key operating priority is superior execution across our 20,000 programs. We continue to retire risk on our key watch list programs. As this quarter demonstrates our operating performance is on a path of improvement.  And with that I will turn the call over to Jim.
James F. Palmer : Thanks Wes, and good morning ladies and gentlemen. My comments will focus on first quarter performance and our updated earnings per share guidance for 2009. As the press release mentioned we will be providing additional guidance detail at our Investor Conference on May 5th. Overall it was a good solid quarter. Our 8% sales growth is the highlight, reflecting particularly strong sales results for electronic systems, information systems, and technical services. However, the 8% growth needs to be put into a little bit of a perspective. You may recall that sales in the first quarter of 2008 were reduced by $134 million due to the shipbuilding charge, so adjusting the first quarter 2008 for that amount gives us sales growth of about 6%, which is really more representative of the trends during the quarter. First quarter segment operating income was 9.5% compared with 5.9% last year due to the $326 million shipbuilding charge, but I should also remind you that last year's first quarter benefited from patent infringement settlements of $19 million that increased royalty income in electronic systems. Other than in shipbuilding, margin rates for all sectors were in line or better than our guidance for the year. EPS on a GAAP basis grew by 54% on a year-over-year basis, and on a pension-adjusted basis, EPS more than doubled from $0.64 to $1.32. Turning to slide 10. First quarter 2009 cash was a use of $172 million, to compare to last year though I would adjust that use of cash for the $214 million discretionary pension pre-funding this quarter. This provides a more useful comparison of $42 million for the first quarter of 2009, versus $194 million in the first quarter of 2008. As shown on the slide, the increase in trade working capital is the biggest driver of the year-over-year change. The increase is due primarily to two factors.  First, last year’s trade working capital was reduced by the accrual for the $326 million shipbuilding charge and also by $150 million of higher level advances in aerospace and electronics than we had this year. Partially offsetting those items were billing delays experienced as we transfer to new systems. So, adjusting last year for all of these items the increase in trade working capital in last year's first quarter would have been about $725 million rather than the $450 million shown on the chart.  The second factor in the working capital growth is the timing of cash collections, principally between the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of this year. Compared to our fourth quarter 2008 plans we pulled forward approximately $200 million of collections into the fourth quarter. This is one of the reasons that that quarter’s cash from operations reached the billion-dollar mark, a remarkable accomplishment that represented about a third of the $3.2 billion of cash from operations in 2008. So, as I analyze cash flow results for the quarter, there is nothing that particularly concerns me about those results and how they affect our cash from operations and free cash flow guidance for the year. As I said last quarter, we anticipated that cash from operations in 2009 would once again be weighted towards the second half of the year. And I would remind you that our 2009 cash flow guidance is before our discretionary pre-funding of our pension plans.  Let’s move now to earnings per share guidance on slide 11. We’re increasing our 2009 GAAP EPS guidance by $0.15 to a range of $4.65 to $4.90 from the prior guidance of $4.50 to $4.75. We’re also increasing our 2009 pension adjusted EPS guidance by the same amount to a range of $5.30 to $5.55 from the prior guidance of $5.15 to $5.40. The increase reflects our solid first quarter performance, as well as, the expected net pre-tax gain of $60 million to $70 million resulting from the settlement of the Microelectronics and TSSAM litigation.  Our 2009 guidance reflects the learning that we’re still experiencing at the Gulf Coast shipyards as reflected in our updated DACs. The uncertainty around the timing of any potential program impacts related to Secretary Gates’ 2010 budget recommendations and the continued uncertainty in the capital markets, which could impact future pension cost. During 2009 we do plan to continue our balanced cash deployment strategy as demonstrated by our first quarter share repurchases of $150 million and the discretionary pension pre-funding of $214 million.  We’ve the financial strength and flexibility to do so, and as I said I see nothing in the first quarter results that changes my outlook for Northrop Grumman’s 2009 cash flows. We have approximately $780 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization and as I indicated in last quarter’s call, we are contemplating discretionary pension pre-funding of approximately $500 million for 2009. This is over and above our required 2009 pension contributions of $126 million.  So, in summary it was a very solid quarter, one in which we continue to focus on risk reduction, performance and growth. And Paul with that I think we are ready to turn it back over for Q&A.
Paul Gregory: Okay. We are ready. So [Francis] we will begin the Q&A session.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our first question is from the line of Robert Stallard from Macquarie. Please proceed.
Robert Stallard – Macquarie: Good morning. Hello
Ronald D. Sugar: How are you?
Robert Stallard – Macquarie: Hi, Ron. First of all, I’d like to ask you about what Secretary Gates said the other day about insourcing? And the attempt by the administration to perhaps bring more work back in-house versus putting it with contractors. As you look to the long-term what sort of impact do you think this could have on Northrop Grumman?
Ronald D. Sugar: Well Rob, this is Ron. It’s not clear yet. What he did say was that he was looking at adding something between 10,000 and 20,000 new positions in acquisition in the government. To put that in perspective, probably 8 or 10 years ago the government had about 0.5 million acquisition folks. Over the years they reduced that to 200,000 or so. What he is talking about is adding 10,000 to 20,000 back to that 200,000. Anything that strengthens the acquisition capabilities of the defense department we see is very positive for us as well as for the government. In terms of insourcing, there is a significant amount of work that we and others do. Some of it may go back to the government and frankly there is going to be an enormous need for the kind of capabilities that industry has in addition to whatever it is done there. Don't particularly see that as a threat at this point in time, obviously we'll learn more details as the year progresses.
Robert Stallard – Macquarie: Okay, as a quick follow up, actually on the shipbuilding side, we’ve seen General Dynamics and Lockheed Martin sign up to fixed-price incentive fee contract on a couple of programs in recent months. Do you anticipate future shipbuilding programs for Northrop Grumman following a similar trend?
Ronald D. Sugar: Well Rob, we do have a fixed-price contracts on ships that are in serial production where there is maturity in the learning curve and in fact that’s often where we can make very good margins. So, I would expect that overtime with the ships that are in serial production. At the present time we don't have any contractual agreements or relationships on the [swap] destroyer work and obviously through the course of the year we are going to sit down and make sure that we work out a business arrangements here that make a great deal of sense for us, as well as, the Navy and for our shareholders. So, at this point in time it's to be determined to the form of those contracts is going to take.
Robert Stallard – Macquarie: And these contracts are actually signed up in relatively early stage of development. Do you see that as a trend to look to in the future as well?
Ronald D. Sugar: Well, obviously it's a negotiation. Our general view is that early ships are not appropriate for fixed-price development, because of the uncertainties associated with them. We think that, that doesn't usually work to the advantage of the government as well. Clearly as we go forward if we restart the DDG-51 destroyer line, that's the ship we certainly know how to build, that maybe a different situation than some of the initial work on the three new DDG 1000s.
Robert Stallard – Macquarie: Okay. Thanks very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr from Cowen & Company. Please proceed.
Cai von Rumohr – Cowen & Company: Yes, thank you. Could you give us a little more color on the reserves you took on the DDG-51 and LPD 22 in terms of the size of those and the size of the reversal? Jim Palmer
James F. Palmer: Yeah Cai. On the DDG-51 it was $38 million of P&L impact in the quarter and a similar amount on LPD 22. And then offsetting that [Myers] will get all the questions answered at the same time offsetting that was about a total of $48 million on LHD 8, $30 million from return of risk reserves, and about $18 million from price escalation adjustments. 
Cai von Rumohr – Cowen & Company: Okay, terrific. And, so could you go through a little more detail why we have on DDG-51, which is a mature program, why it happens there?
Wesley G. Bush: Yeah, Cai it’s Wes, let me take that one on with you. There are several perspectives that would offer to help frame the action that you saw in the quarter on these ships. First, all of our ships on the Gulf Coast as you know are long cycle programs, it takes many years to build these ships and it takes time for improvements to show, particularly after we’ve gone through a period of substantial disruption. We are very confident that we are making the right improvements across the board in the shipped construction activities. It’s taking some time for all of those things to pull through. And if you reflect back to the first quarter of last year we took a charge in the first quarter of ’08, that reflected our view of the direct impacts on LHD 8 for the additional cost that we would incur there as a result of many of the things that we found, but it also selected at the time our expectation of impacts on the other ships in process in the Gulf. As it has turned out the impact on LHD 8 was somewhat less, but the impact on the other ships was somewhat greater. And Jim just went through with you kind of the numbers on how that looks to be balancing out. The third perspective I would offer to put some color on the numbers in the quarter is as I said in my remarks we’ve decided to reflect in our fee booking rates, a broader anticipation of the risk profile on these ships. We’ll certainly be happy overtime to increase the booking rates on those ships if we successfully mitigate [as part of you] of the risk, particularly as the ships mature over the phase of construction. But we’ve taken a view here that I think is the right approach given the lessons learned that we’ve had over the last year and a half.
Cai von Rumohr – Cowen & Company: Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Myles Walton. Please proceed.
Ronald D. Sugar: Hello Myles. 
James F. Palmer: Miles, we can’t hear you.
Ronald D. Sugar: Must be on mute.
Myles Walton – Oppenheimer & Co.: Apologize. Can you hear me now?
Ronald D. Sugar: Yes, we can.
Myles Walton – Oppenheimer & Co.: Great. Question for you on shipbuilding again and trying to interpret some remarks made by Secretary Young on the fixed-price, both for the 1000 and the 51. In his recent remarks he talked about a $2 billion per hull number for the 51, which seemed a little high, and so, I was trying to interpret that, is that a cost of restarting the line or is that in anticipation of adding capability to the 51? And if you are adding capability to the 51, is this really a serial production that you’d sign up to a fixed-price basis on.
Ronald D. Sugar: Well, let me take that one Myles. First of all I’m not quite sure of what Secretary Young factored into his $2 billion hull. My guess it’s not just the hull, but also the topside in the weapon system as well. There are going to be some improvements in the 51, many of those will be in the form of the topside, which we’re not directly involved with, some of them will be involved in the missiles and the communications electronics, but the fundamental hull will probably be the same. One of the plans that we’ve discussed with the Navy is that before actually constructing the next tranche of DDG 51s. We will do a careful engineering planning activity, which will be funded to get a scoring on that to make sure that we fully understand what changes are going to be made, but incremental and evolutionary changes are very different than starting a brand new first-of-class ship. So, I think as we go through the year we will see what the exact plan looks like and clearly we will enter into contract negotiations very prudently.
Myles Walton – Oppenheimer & Co.: Okay. And then with respect to the 1000, I guess the U.S. is looking to press GD into the fixed-price for their portion, but obviously your portion would be [GFE], would you anticipate that they’ll be asking you to sign up for a fixed-price as well on your topside portions.
Ronald D. Sugar: Myles at this point of time, I have no idea, obviously GDE is having its own discussions with the Navy on its piece, our piece would be separate to the Navy.
Myles Walton – Oppenheimer & Co.: Okay, okay. Fair enough, thanks. 
Wesley G. Bush: Thank you Myles. 
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Ron Epstein. Please proceed.
Ronald Epstein – BAS-ML: Good morning guys.
Ronald D. Sugar: Hey Ron.
Ronald Epstein – BAS-ML: Another ship question for you, kind of it’s harder. There has been some discussion that the catapult on CVN 78 having some issues, I guess the Navy has been talking about that for a while. How should we think about that? I mean if there is a delay in exit, the subcontractor on that were General Atomics, how does that impact the program and how could that impact you guys?
Ronald D. Sugar: Well Ron, first of all, that contract is being run separately by the Navy with another contractor, General Atomics. The current program of record is the EMALS, Electromagnetic catapult is baselined into the ship. We’re proceeding with that assumption, we are working with the Navy and the General Atomics to accommodate the catapult into the ship and as we see at this point in time we are going to proceed with that plan. Clearly if there is an impact on our ship we’ll consider that and discuss with the Navy what that impact would be. At this point in time we and the Navy are making every effort to go forward.
Ronald Epstein – BAS-ML: Now, 78 is cost plus ship, so if there was some sort of delay or change that would passthrough?
Ronald D. Sugar: That is correct. It’s a cost plus ship and if there are any change in scope to the ship or impact as a result of government furnished equipment that would be contractually remedied.
Ronald Epstein – BAS-ML: Okay. And then in Secretary Gates’ remarks like four weeks ago, he did mention that he wanted to review the L series of landing ships. What impact do you think that could have on your business? I mean do you think it will want to pullback the L series ships, and if so what does that mean for the Gulf Coast shipyards?
Ronald D. Sugar: Well I think in the near-term that is the next couple of years I don’t see much of any impact. I think as part of the destroyer swap, one element of it is continuing with the serial production of LPDs, is are turning out to be a wonderful class of ship for the Navy. When you talk about L series, you are thinking about all kinds of classes here, LPDs, LHDs, LHA and also some of the LMSR or potential future pre-positioning ships, which are not currently in construction. I think the real question will be how does the Navy think about its amphibious strategy going forward and what mix will it need. At this point in time, we also know that there is a strong desire to have common hull forms wherever possible. And it turns out that the LPD hull form is emerging as a very, very useful hull form not only for the [Korean] the current amphibious ship, but also for potentially other users. I will see how that all develops during the QDR process. I think the near-term impact in the next few years is not clear there is going to be any.
Ronald Epstein – BAS-ML: Okay, great. Thank you.
Ronald D. Sugar: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Joe Nadol with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
Joseph Nadol – JPMorgan: Thanks. Good afternoon now. I hate to do this to you, but on shipbuilding again, I actually got punted off the call before, and I’m looking at the transcript here. I missed some of these numbers live, but at least what it shows in the transcript is that the reversals, the gains were larger than the P&L negative impact from the LPD in DDG 51, is that right?
James F. Palmer: That's not correct Joe. The two negatives, DDG 51, $38 million; LPD 22, another $38 million, total of $76 million, positives LPD or LHD 8, $48 million net of $28 million negative.
Joseph Nadol – JPMorgan: Okay. Okay, so where I was going with it is. What is this? You’re going to book these ships more conservatively from hereon out. What is the implication on the guidance for the year? What’s the normalized run rate at this point?
James F. Palmer: Joe I was obviously anticipating this question, and I really going to get into details at the investor conference, but I think on ships, it is important that we talk about the view for the rest of the year. And frankly from my perspective having the chain down there focused on improving the processes, executing the plan that Wes outlined for you and achieving a 7% margin for the year that would be good performance. 
Joseph Nadol – JPMorgan: Okay.
James F. Palmer: So that's what we’re fully focused on for those guys.
Joseph Nadol – JPMorgan: Okay. And then just one more longer run on the carrier. What exactly is your understanding of where Secretary Gates is looking to go with the carrier build rate? Going to ‘10, but talking about 2040 and what’s the impact over the next five, six, seven years.
Ronald D. Sugar: Well Joe obviously we’re trying to understand the details behind that. Our current read is that for the next several years there will be virtually no impact on our current plans, and that's because of the work-in-process. There has been discussion of pushing CVN 79 hard start to the right by a year from 2012 to 2013, but the fact is we're already at work on CVN 79. And there is no real magic event that occurs as a moment of funding approval, but we already are under pre-construction work now. I think that overtime we’ll see with the retirement of the enterprise, some pressure on the number of ships in the fleet, but I would point out that the retirement of the enterprise will very likely involve significant work for our shipyard as we dismantle that ship, that’s a complex ship with eight nuclear reactors. There is a lot of work to do there. And frankly a lot of additional work for the current carrier fleet on refueling and overhauls that will continue during that entire timeframe. So, as I stand back and look at the comments on carrier, I don't see in the next couple of years a significant change to our plans or workload.
Joseph Nadol – JPMorgan: In the Ohio class replacement, is that an opportunity for you?
Ronald D. Sugar: Yes, it is and we’re already working with General Dynamics our partner and the Navy on some advanced planning for that boat. That would be a helpful upside opportunity. And frankly the two submarines [Carrier] and Virginia-Class is coming along. I don't think there is anything that we heard in the Secretary's comments that would say that’s not going to happen. And I would point out that that shipbuilding program is probably about as well run as anything we've seen in the industry. Both companies are making great progress. We’re profitable and the Navy is getting good ships for lower prices.
Joseph Nadol – JPMorgan: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed.
Douglas Harned – Sanford C. Bernstein: Good morning.
Ronald D. Sugar: Good morning Doug.
James F. Palmer: Hey Doug.
Douglas Harned – Sanford C. Bernstein: On ships again, in the Gulf, now that you’ve delivered the LHD 8, how was that change or has it changed your ability to deliver on the LPD 17 and the DDG 51s?
Wesley G. Bush: Hi, Doug it’s Wes. Clearly it’s a positive development. The craft resources are largely free from that intense focus we’ve had on LHD 8, but I think the important thing to pull the string on here, it’s not so much the craft resources, it’s the learning that’s occurred over the past 15 months or so, as we have dug in on LHD 8 to really understand that full set of issues not just the immediacy of the issues, but the longer-term events and decisions that led to the issues. And as we are incorporating those lessons learnt into the LPD series and the DDG series, I think we’re on the right track. We’re making some very good improvements in the way that not only we are performing the work, but the way that we are making decisions on how we perform the work. So, there are a variety of positives that come out of this. And as I said in my earlier remarks, it will take a little bit of time to see all of that manifest, but we’re convinced we’re on the right track with it.
Douglas Harned – Sanford C. Bernstein: And then separately on information technology, you mentioned that you have had a little bit of a hit on your margins due to the state and local activity. Could you talk about what that is, because if I look at it, if you’ve come down a little bit in revenue on those and you are still fine on the EAC, how are those programs going, I’m assuming San Diego, Virginia, New York, I mean how are those three playing out right now?
Ronald D. Sugar: Yeah, Doug all three are performing within their EACS, so we are satisfied with where they are now. We are watching them closely. These programs have been areas that have cost us a little bit of a ripple in the past, so they’re getting an extraordinary amount of management attention. I did note in my remarks that we are seeing the sales in state and local part of our business decline, because we are being much more selective about what we are going after in that area. Jim did you have any thoughts to add on Doug's question? 
James F. Palmer: Yeah Doug, I just point out that, as you know we took some adjustments in the latter half of 2008 on some of those state and local programs. So, if you look at margin rates today, EACS are less talked about versus the first quarter. Essentially there is a lower margin coming out of those programs quarter-to-quarter than it was last year and that accounts for roughly 30 basis points or so of the margin change. 
Douglas Harned – Sanford C. Bernstein: Is there a milestone here where you think you will have retired a significant amount of risk, such as the Virginia, I mean you’ve got a transition scheduled to coming up in Virginia for example.
Ronald D. Sugar: Yeah, we see a lot of that risk getting retired over the course of this year.
Douglas Harned – Sanford C. Bernstein: Okay. Okay. Thanks.
Ronald D. Sugar: Okay. Thanks Doug.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies & Company. Please proceed.
Howard Rubel – Jefferies & Company: Thank you very much. Two things. First Jim, when you downsized from seven business units to five, could you help us understand a little bit of what kind of cost savings you got and probably Ron or Wes talk a little bit about sort of how you’ve gotten maybe some benefits in terms of just other operating synergies.
Ronald D. Sugar: Well first of all, Howard our focus was on creating business units, which were more agile in the marketplace, which allowed us to bring together capabilities to be able to more aggressively compete will be more competitive. Certainly there is a benefit of cost savings and as proceeding we haven't been terribly public about what that is, that comes along with it, but our primary focus has been marketplace competitiveness. And for example if you take a look at areas like cyber security where we had two fairly large sectors pursuing that in the market we’ve now put that together and organized the pieces, so that the predominant portion of that market area is in one business unit within the new sector run by Linda Mills. And we’re finding that there are significant benefits, synergies, and we are also seeing that we’re able to apply bidding resources more aggressively on the major pursuits which sometimes would not have been possible, we had smaller business units. So, all in all I think we’re pretty pleased with the strategic value of putting these things together.
James F. Palmer: I’d add that we clearly have cost reduction targets for each of those consolidations, they are executing on them. The primary focus though as Ron said is achieving those cost reduction objectives, to enhance our competitiveness on a go-forward basis. There will be some cost to implement those to the extent that they are employ related, but on a net-net basis we're going to be better off for all of those activities.
Howard Rubel – Jefferies & Company: It's not wrong now to think that with the 700 people or more or less that we’re looking at, it could be anywhere from $50 million to a little over $100 million of which probably keep a reasonable amount of that although some goes back to the customer.
Ronald D. Sugar: Well lot goes back to the customer and you know while we’re taking out significant number of people in terms of announced reductions of overhead folks, we’re hiring that many people and more as direct people on new contracts. So, you could also think of this Howard as stiffening up the mix of direct versus indirect labor inside the businesses as well, putting more folks on direct work and less folks on overhead in the back office.
Wesley G. Bush: Yeah, Howard, one thing I would add to your earlier. This is Wes. 
Howard Rubel – Jefferies & Company: Yeah.
Wesley G. Bush: Your question on the benefits. A lot of focus gets applied to the benefits that we're getting out of our information systems business, it’s sort of an obvious view of cyber security and many of the things the two prior sectors had addressed. Sometimes we get the question about the aerospace side of it and one thing that I would address in the context of your question on benefits is the remarkable synergy that we're seeing and what I’ve described before is the aerospace continuum. You know, if you think about a global hawk vehicle, this was a highly ISR capable platform that’s operating largely autonomously for well over a day all by itself. You might think of that as a satellite unbound by Kepler. It is a set of technologies and a set of machine capabilities that has a lot of alignment with what we’ve been doing historically in our space business. And as we think about how we invest and back to your question on cost, how we think about utilizing resources that we might make available in this process of integration. We see ourselves as being able to make very good investments with the synergy in these technology areas that continue to move us ahead in the areas that Secretary Gates has identified as substantial investments going forward, ISR being chief among those. So, we see a lot of benefits both in the aerospace side and in the information system side resulting from this consolidation.
Howard Rubel – Jefferies & Company: That’s what I was thinking. And then just while we're here, UAV, you are the leader in the Unmanned vehicle market today and if we were to make a stab at sort of what's your run rate is in this business, it's probably like a $1.25 billion to $1.5 billion a year, is that fair or am I being a little conservative?
James F. Palmer: That's a little high Howard I would think, probably closer to the billion level.
Howard Rubel – Jefferies & Company: And then the last thing and politics is always sort of intrudes its head in one fashion or another in this process and the Senators from Alabama appear to be tying to set the playing field so that there is no other choice other than Northrop to win this. I mean how do you react to this and I mean that looks like it’s a good thing, but at the same time there is a certain element of tilting the game in an inappropriate manner.
James F. Palmer: Well look Howard, I can’t comment what the Senators from Alabama may or may not be doing, I will tell you that the competition that was run was from our judgment, one of the most thorough we had ever seen in the history of the defense department acquisition. The airplane that was selected had clearly greater capability, the fuel range, cargo and it was $3 billion less for the group of airplanes that were being purchased. That was the acquisition process. There was a political intrusion to that process which stopped it, that’s life; we have to deal with that. All we can do is keep our head down, move forward. We do have the most capable airplane and we’ll play the game again when the new rules are announced.
Howard Rubel – Jefferies & Company: Yeah, I think that’s the right answer. I appreciate that. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Joe Campbell with Barclays Capital. Please proceed.
Joseph Campbell – Barclays Capital: Good morning.
Ronald D. Sugar: Good morning Joe.
Joseph Campbell – Barclays Capital: I have a question, not about ships, but about airplanes and bombers, I see the Secretary deferred something that the Air Force was contemplating with regard to long-range strike and you guys are the prose at this stuff. How does this change, I know it won’t have any real EPS impact, but what were the kind of ways that you saw the Air Force heading and with the change that Secretary Gates has announced, how do you see it now heading and I expect Northrop will play a role no matter what they do?
Ronald D. Sugar: Joe, a good question, I really can't offer too much more insight on the Secretary’s comments on that, but I would tell you that the most capable bomber in the fleet today is the B2. We do a very substantial amount of work when maintenance and upgrade of the current B2. My guess is that that workload is going to continue perhaps increase if there is a delay of bringing on a new fleet of bombers past 2018 or so. So, irrespective of how this goes, if there would be a new bomber program clearly Northrop has interest in tremendous experience, we build the last one, if there is none for a while Northrop Grumman is right in the middle of upgrading and making more capable the current B2.
Joseph Campbell – Barclays Capital: Right, but what about, what were you up to prior to the announcement and how did you see that the Air Force was heading and you were clearly in pursuit of it. 
Ronald D. Sugar: Yeah. Joe unfortunately I don't really have much to offer to answer that question.
Joseph Campbell – Barclays Capital: Is this just a classified thing or you just don’t want to talk about it?
Ronald D. Sugar: I just don't have any information I could provide on that. 
Joseph Campbell – Barclays Capital: All right.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Heidi Wood with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. 
Heidi Wood – Morgan Stanley: Good afternoon guys.
Ronald D. Sugar: Hi Heidi.
James F. Palmer: Hi Heidi.
Heidi Wood – Morgan Stanley: Little bit more of a strategy question for you, if you don't mind; I agree with you that with your positioning of the portfolio vis-à-vis Gates’ priorities is fairly attractive. I'm wondering in addition to sort of organic opportunities whether we should anticipate that you might step-up activity on the M&A environment to fill out your position. Well maybe I’ll do it as a multipart, so that’s first question.
Ronald D. Sugar: Okay. Well, Heidi obviously as we’ve said with your balance cash deployment strategy, we are always looking at M&A. Valuations are more attractive that they’ve been in the past. Clearly if we were to do something we’d have to make strategic sense. If we see something of that sort we’ll obviously consider it. We have done a number of small acquisitions overtime and the track record over the last several years has been substantially strengthening our cyber and ISR capabilities with very valuable niche properties. Nothing of huge scale even F-6 was not that large, but each one of these things did add to the capability. So, if there are opportunities going forward, we are going to keep our eyes open. Meanwhile our track record has been pretty solid above returning cash to shareholders in the forms of dividends, repurchases, we’ve been prudently prepaying our pension plan expenses and of course we’ve kept our debt very much under control here. So, we’ll look at all of these things if there is something attractive, then it fits with our strategy, so be it. As I mentioned in my comments we do see some potential upside for the Northrop portfolio in areas involving cyber, C4ISR unmanned platforms also another area, which was not mentioned heavily, but health information technology where we’ve done some work and continue to expand our work, the department and other federal agencies will need help there. So, we see some opportunities here coming forward.
Heidi Wood – Morgan Stanley: Another area Ron that you didn’t mention, but I’m wondering about your positioning on as smart power. I wonder if I could add fullness to that? And also Gates is also on sort of a cost reform war path and there is a discussion about sort of try and move towards 85% capabilities at 60% of the cost and Global Hawk still carries a fairly hefty price tag. Do you see ourselves expanding on the UAV side more towards the lower-end or can you drive down the cost of Global Hawk to keep it attractive within this administration?
Ronald D. Sugar: Well first of all Heidi, every indication I have is that Global Hawk is an extraordinarily attractive system. All the feedback we get from the operation commanders using this system both the Air Force and the Navy folks using the demonstrators as they can’t get enough of it, they want more, and if you take a look at the plans for production and also the amount of money being put into Global Hawk versus all the other new UAV’s combined its pretty impressive. So, obviously if you think about the fact that Global Hawk block 10, block 20, block 30, now block 40 are underway at the Air Force. We were selected to win VAMS even though some would argue that it was a more expensive platform than the other two offerings. I think under cost effect that this is an extraordinarily capable asset. So, I don't have a concern about that. We certainly do have offerings in the lower end as well; the Fire Scout platform is something, which is getting tremendous interest from the Navy. We’ve demonstrated operations aboard ships at sea. The United States Army is interested in Fire Scout and of course the coast guard is seriously considering as well. So, we see a set of interesting opportunities across the space in unmanned vehicles. It is true the concept of 85% capability for substantial [less the] cost is important. In certain assets just give you tremendous value for the money. As you compare the cost of a Global Hawk with other manned aircraft trying to do this mission or even certain satellite programs, it’s a very cost-effective proposition.
Heidi Wood – Morgan Stanley: Thanks Ron. That’s helpful, and can you just finish up on the Smart Power dynamic.
Ronald D. Sugar: Well we're all for it. Whatever it turns out to be, one of the things that we have done in our technical services sector is provided specific support to state department in other programs where we’re going to be doing work with folks in country. So, wherever we can use all the elements of power that’s great and we’ll see how that translates into actual significant business opportunities for the company.
Heidi Wood – Morgan Stanley: Excellent. Thanks very much gentlemen.
James F. Palmer: Thank you Heidi.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wachovia. Please proceed.
Sam Pearlstein – Wachovia: Good afternoon.
Ronald D. Sugar: Hey Sam
James F. Palmer: Hey Sam
Sam Pearlstein – Wachovia: Question is just more philosophical is that if I look at the litigation gain of the $60 million to $70 million that you recognize, is why not accelerate some of the facility consolidations or other cost reduction efforts to offset that, so that you might be able to realize some of those savings sooner?
Ronald D. Sugar: Well, Sam let me take a first cut and then have our expert here Jim add in their idea. I think the accounting rules require that you basically take these charges as you incur them particularly when you’re doing consolidations and more personnel reductions, and a very separate thing. So, you know we see a gain coming from return of profit. We have other litigation expenses associated with that particular set of matters as well as some other litigation we see coming. We just basically show it to you as it comes.
James F. Palmer: I don’t know if I could add a whole lot more. Sam not to imply that we’re not aggressively moving after the cost consolidation, as I said both their information services and aerospace segment have targets that they are working to achieve and they are occurring at the same time, those cost would actually be reimbursable under our government contracts to the extent there are cost to implement them as Howard pointed out, any savings that we achieve there would be shared with our government customer as well, conversely the litigation settlement is not a cost or a credit in this case that is shared with our government customer. So, I really don’t, may be from a financial accounting perspective they could offset, but from a government contract perspective, they don’t.
Sam Pearlstein – Wachovia: Okay. Thank you. And then just separately I know you wanted to get into the detail at your Analyst Day, but you mentioned that if ships got to 7% that would be good performance and when you gave guidance a couple of months ago at the end of the fourth quarter it seems like it was higher. So, I’m just wondering can you talk about what some of the offset might be to still end up at the same place in terms of the earnings for the year.
James F. Palmer: It's essentially the items that we talked about the lower earnings on DDG 51s and the LPDs going forward.
Sam Pearlstein – Wachovia: No, I mean, if that only does 7% this year, not the 8% that you originally said, what's happening in the other businesses to make up some of that shortfall?
James F. Palmer: Again, we're seeing strong performance out of electronics and aerospace in particular.
Sam Pearlstein – Wachovia: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of David Strauss with UBS. Please proceed.
David Strauss – UBS: Thanks. Just following-up I think where Sam was going. If you look, on the revenue side you did 6% or 8% whatever you want to call in terms of revenue growth. There is no change in your revenue forecast for the year, because I guess at this point it would imply flat revenues for the rest of the year.
James F. Palmer: Actually revenues would be up a little bit in each of the quarters over the first quarter and as I… 
David Strauss – UBS: I guess year-over-year.
James F. Palmer: More flat on a year-over-year basis, small increases I think, but I think David what's really important is again as the new administration has come into place, the Secretary Gates comments around the 2010 budget and now that QDR obviously we have a lot of new opportunities that we've been pursuing. We've seen some delay in some of those opportunities and it's really hard to project whether or not they are going to occur yet this year or next. So, that’s really the uncertainty if you will, around the revenue forecast at this point in time and as those activities or opportunities are realized, we’ll obviously update if need be, but at this point in time I can’t really tell when actually those RFPs are going to come out and the due dates for new decisions are going to be made.
David Strauss – UBS: Okay, and Jim on FAS/CAS is that going to ramp during the course of the year, because if it just kind of stays at this level would come in I think $30 million to $40 million under what you had guided to?
James F. Palmer: Yeah, basically it’s going to be fairly constant as we go through the year and you are right we’re $10 million or $20 million, $30 million whatever under what we thought we would be as we firmed up the CAS numbers, Cost Accounting numbers after year-end.
David Strauss – UBS: Okay, and Ron. Could you update us where we are on E-2D, I mean there have been kind of some scroll around the program some stuff coming out of Washington.
Ronald D. Sugar: E-2D for those who are not familiar is the Advanced Hawkeye, it’s a Navy Carrier based airborne warning and control aircraft. It is a new aircraft development. We’ve already built a couple of aircraft, we’re testing them. The program is going extraordinarily well, the Navy is extremely satisfied with the technical progress and I will tell you the performance of the radar and the system is fabulous. There is a law involving non [Inaudible] breach and as a result a variety of factors almost of none of which were related to the performance of the program by our company, there are some accounting issues there which may push it close to that and there is some questions about what is that mean. Best I can tell this is a government process issue, our job is to keep the plane moving, keep the program going, we are doing a great job on that. We will work through it, there is no doubt in my mind of the unwavering demand for the aircraft. So, we’ll see how that plays out. New aircraft developments are not easy, I would say the E2 has gone about as well as any I’ve seen in the last 10 years.
David Strauss – UBS: Thanks guys.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
Robert Springarn – Credit Suisse: Hi guys. Good afternoon.
Ronald D. Sugar: Hey Rob.
Robert Springarn – Credit Suisse: Or good morning on the West Coast. A couple of things first of all Jim. Should we understand that the revenue guidance from before is technically suspended or withdrawn or it’s just not updated. How should we think about it?
James F. Palmer: It is not updated. Yeah.
Robert Springarn – Credit Suisse: Yeah.
James F. Palmer: Yeah, I thought what was most important is to talk about earnings per share and we’ll go through all the details in May meeting.
Robert Springarn – Credit Suisse: Okay. And then, switching more strategic back to the Secretary Gates’ discussion. I don’t Ron or Wes if these are for you. But could you talk a little about upside perhaps in the aircraft side F-35 and F-18. And also classified space which maybe making a comeback and then on the offset downside in missile defense.
Ronald D. Sugar: Okay. Well, let me take a crack at that Robert. F-35, I was just at the Joint Strike Fighter CEO conference. I think we’re pleased with the five-year plan is very consistent with what we’ve assumed and certainly our partner Lockheed has assumed as well. I see that as a very strong opportunity for the company. And as you know, we have a very substantial part of that aircraft and the electronics that are on it. F-18s, there will be continue production of F-18s and we’re in partnership there with Boeing. And we see that as positive, and as you know the F-18 program is a very strong program for Northrop. And we are very much in serious production there. That's looking good. With missile defense, it’s less clear what the puts and takes will be. Clearly there is some talk about moving the airborne laser to an RD program, but frankly that’s what we kind of expected anyway. We do see an opportunity for some upside with the Kinetic Energy Interceptor, because it is very clear to me and others that the nation does need a boost and ascent phase capability and the KEI as we move through our various test milestones is very likely the right system to fill that need and we did in fact have this last quarter some very successful test results as we move toward a test here in the next year or so. So, on the Missile Defense side I think that there could be some upside, we’ll see where that plays out. With respect to restricted space, I really can’t say a whole lot about that, except to say that our aerospace business forecast factors in all space programs and we see strength there.
Robert Spingarn – Credit Suisse : From the programs where we discussed upside, can we see a material move from ’09 to’10?
Ronald D. Sugar: I think it’s too early to say right now Robert. We don’t know yet at this point in time and we’re not really even prepared to make any overall guidance recommendations on ’10. I think I have to see how the legislative process moves forward. Keep in mind that the Secretary’s proposal was a proposal, the administration proposes the Congress dispossess as they say, and I think that there will be as the political process develops some puts and takes on his offerings we will see where all that comes out. And to Jim’s comments earlier, that’s the reason why we want to be somewhat cautious as we look through the rest of the year on revenue.
Robert Spingarn – Credit Suisse: Okay. Thanks Ron.
Ronald D. Sugar: Okay.
Wesley G. Bush: Okay, I think that’s it.
Ronald D. Sugar: Okay, let me if I could just wrap up final comments, as you can see we're off to a strong start in ’09. We continue our focus on reducing risk in this portfolio, driving performance and positioning ourselves for growth. We saw Secretary Gates’ 2010 proposal in a positive light, we think there is some good opportunities from Northrop going forward. We'll see how that all plays out in the Congress process in the next six months or so and we've a lot more to say about these and other things when we see you in Baltimore in a couple of weeks. So, thank you all for joining us and I will see you again.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you all for your participation in today's conference call. This concludes the presentation and you may now disconnect.

 :  
Operator: Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Northrup Grumman fourth quarter earnings conference call. My name is [Onika] and I will be your operator for today. At this time all participants are in listen only mode. We will have a question and answer portion at the conclusion of the presentation. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. At this time I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Gaston Kent, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Gaston Kent:  Welcome to our fourth quarter 2008 conference call. We’ve provided supplemental information in the form of a PowerPoint presentation that you can access on our investor relations website at www.NorthrupGrumman.com. Before we start, please understand that matters discussed on today’s call constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which are detailed in today’s press release and our SEC filings and may cause actual company results to differ materially. During the call we’ll discuss fourth quarter and full year results and 2009 guidance. We will refer to non-GAAP measures which are defined and reconciled in our earnings release and supporting materials which are posted on our website.  On January 7th, we announced a reorganization that impacts several of our businesses. The 2009 guidance we present today will reflect our new organization. For reporting purposes, the reorganization will be reflected in our first quarter 2009 results.  On the call today are our Chairman and CEO Ron Sugar, our President and COO Wes Bush and our Chief Financial Officer Jim Palmer. Also with us today is Paul Gregory, Paul is my replacement as Vice President of Investor Relations and will be your primary contact at Northrup Grumman as soon as I push the off button on this call. He was previously the Chief Financial Officer of our space technology sector.  If you’d now please go to Slide Three, I’d like to turn the call over to Ron.
Ronald D. Sugar : Thanks for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and full year results. Operationally we had a very strong finish to the year. We achieved record sales, record cash from operations and record free cash flow. Sales increased 6% to nearly $34 billion making us now the nation’s second largest defense contractor.  We had a tremendous year for cash generation. Cash from operations and free cash flow exceeded the upper end of our prior guidance range even after $200 million for discretionary pre-funding of our pension plans. Our adjusted EPS from continuing operations totaled $5.21 which also exceeded the upper end of our prior guidance. This excludes the previously announced goodwill impairment charge which was driven by the dramatic declines in market multiples. This non-cash charge did not affect our operations. Jim will report on this in more detail shortly. The yearend number I’m most pleased to report is total backlog. We begin 2009 with a record $78 billion backlog, a 23% increase over last year’s ending backlog. In 2008 we captured a record $48 billion in new business which comprises of substantial competitive wins and large follow on awards in our core franchise programs. This represents a very healthy 143% book to build ratio. Our backlog growth demonstrates two major strengths, first our company continues to become more competitive. We had substantial competitive wins across our business portfolio resulting from our leading edge technologies and innovative solutions for our customers.  For example, we extended our winning streak in the unmanned aerial vehicle space by winning the BAMS program which also demonstrates that our internal R&D investments are really paying off. Second, we are leveraging our portfolio of large long term franchise programs that will provide profitable revenue for years to come. Ship building backlog is up $9 billion with the $5.1 billion contract for the Gerald R. Ford Carrier and the $5.6 billion contract for Block-3 Virginia Class submarines.  Under the new contract for submarines we and our partner General Dynamics will begin producing two boats per year in 2011. This is a strong testament to the success of our industry partnership and its record of driving down the Virginia Class costs through teamwork with the United States Navy. Our aerospace business also posted a multibillion dollar backlog increase with key restricted awards, follow ons to franchise programs like the award of 24 F18 ship sets for Australia and the US Navy and new B2 Bomber upgrades worth about $500 million.  The strength of our 2008 financial results allowed us to continue our shareholder value enhancing actions. We increased our divided by 8%, the fifth consecutive annual increase and a doubling of the dividend since 2003. We also repurchased $21.4 million shares of our common stock during the year and we have $945 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization. Along with executing our balanced cash deployment strategy, we continue to maintain a strong balance sheet.  Even with the goodwill impairment charge and decline in pension plan assets, we ended 2008 with a net debt to total capital ratio of 15% and we continue to enjoy the highest credit rating in the company’s history. In this economic environment, we intend to maintain a strong balance sheet and significant liquidity. We see continuing solid performance for the company next year. For 2009 earnings, we are focusing on performance as measured by pension adjusted earnings. On that basis, we see year-over-year earnings per share growth of between 9% and 15%. The use of pension adjusted EPS estimates, eliminates the distortive affect pension accounting has when comparing our 2008 results with our outlook for 2009.  Now, turning to the defense spending environment, President Obama has made strong choices for his national security team. Secretary Gates provides critical continuity with his understanding of the many complex issues facing DOD. Clearly, the new administration well understands that the threat environment we have out there is not diminishing. There is also universal consensus that our service men and women deserve the highest quality weapons systems and security solutions. Our government’s challenge is to balance persistent critical national security needs with the very real economic crisis that is putting unprecedented pressure on government spending. In his recent testimony before Congress, Secretary Gates stated that the DOD must make tough choices. The President’s team will make his priorities known with the release of the 2010 budget and the quadrennial defense review. We will know more in the spring. However, we expect that the majority of our programs at Northrup Grumman will be supported in the 2010 budget process and we believe going forward our portfolio is sharply aligned with both the traditional and emerging priorities. Program execution, innovative solutions and value to the war fighter will be the key competitive differentiators for Northrup Grumman. In addition to the formidable traditional threats our nation faces we must now respond to new unprecedented non-traditional threats. To paraphrase the Director of National Intelligence, cyber attack may pose the 21st century’s most serious economic and national security challenge. Hostile penetrations of the cyber systems of the United States are wide spread, successful and growing. The government will spend substantially to address these risks. We believe that this will be a priority mission under the new administration and Northrup Grumman is a leader in this area. We are currently supplying cyber security systems to many agencies and we are integrating those capabilities to address the cyber security challenge. Organization structure should follow strategy and by recently combining our mission systems and information technology business sectors we have concentrated the majority of our leading capabilities in to a single entity, our new information system sector led by Linda Mills.  The air refueling tanker will be another priority of the new administration. We are very encouraged by the administration’s commitment to our rapid process to replace our aging air refueling tankers. Our nation and our military service men and women urgently need this new tanker. We are fully committed to this program. We won this competition once and we intend to win it again. We are proactively addressing the increasingly competitive environment for our products and services. In January we announced a reorganization of our seven segments in to five. These organizational actions are aimed at strengthening our alignment with customers, improving our ability to execute on our programs and win new business and enhancing our company’s cost competitiveness.  My number one priority for Northrup Grumman is program execution. While there is more work to do, we are making solid progress. Wes will update you on program execution during his comments shortly. In summary, we had a strong operational finish to 2008. We are focused on performance improvement and competitive positioning. We are financially solid and making the necessary investments to capture new programs. We are positioning the company for the future. Now, I’ll turn the call over to Wes for an additional discussion on Northrup Grumman’s operations. 
Wesley G. Bush : My comments today are outlined on Slide Four. This quarter I’ll talk about our business capture efforts, highlight some of the programs we’re pursuing and finish with an update on our program execution. The tremendous effort we put in to our business capture processes is succeeding as demonstrated by our growth in backlog.  Just as important as that level of backlog is the quality of the contracts that we’re entering in to with our customers through an adherence to more stringent bid criteria. We’re being more selective, our total backlog is growing and the quality of that backlog is improving. As we continue to have a very high quality robust multibillion pipeline of opportunities.  In addition to tanker, we’re pursuing the scalable agile beam radar for the F16, CANES or the Consolidated Afloat Networks and Enterprise System program, the airborne ISR programs called EPX and ACS, the TSAT program and the GPS OCX program. We also continue to have substantial opportunities in the restricted area. As you can see with the expansion of our backlog, we are becoming more competitive as we address this robust pipeline.  Turning now to our programs, my key operating priority is superior execution across all of our 20,000 programs. I’ll focus my remarks this morning on the progress we’re making in retiring risk on our key watch list programs. On Block-60 we successfully delivered on schedule the Falcon Edge software increment in the fourth quarter representing a substantial risk retirement milestone. There will be one subsequent key software update to complete the Falcon Edge Electronic Warfare capability later this year. We continue to perform within our EAC with the primary remaining risk mitigation milestone being final contract close out. In last quarter’s Wedgetail update, we were waiting for the customer go ahead again, type acceptance testing. In the fourth quarter we reached a customer agreement that allowed us to start TAT&E. The ground testing phase began in December and flight tests are scheduled to begin this quarter. Successful completion of these tests will represent another major risk mitigation milestone. On the New York City wireless program, we continue to make good progress in building out the network. On January 13th we achieved a key milestone, conditional acceptance and we now have 95% coverage across the city. The system is up and running and providing service to the customer. We expect to achieve full system acceptance in the first half of this year and we’re operating within our EAC.  The San Diego contract continues to perform to its plan as well. Future profitability on this program will depend on the level of revenue from future county service demands. On the Virginia IT program, we’ve made solid progress towards completing the transformation phase of the Commonwealth’s infrastructure transition to the new common IT environment. The focus item on this program will be the timeline for transitioning the remaining agencies over to this new environment.  Our approach to state and local opportunities continues to be very disciplined. We are not bidding on programs unless they meet our stringent criteria. This more selective approach has led to declining revenue from state and local IT programs and this drove the slower growth rate for our IT sector in 2008.  I’m also pleased to report that our ship building team continues to make solid progress LHD 8 achieve its fourth quarter milestone the peer side integrated propulsion test and we began builders trials ahead of schedule with an initial trial in December. In that trial we demonstrated all the primary capabilities with the exception of the full power and endurance runs for the propulsion systems. These tests are planned to be performed with the final builders trial that is scheduled for this quarter. Acceptance trials will follow shortly thereafter. We’re on track to deliver the LHD 8 in the second quarter of 2009. We continue to perform well against the EAC and we were able to recover some reserve in the fourth quarter as we retired the risk. So, in summary, we continue to make good progress on these programs as this quarter’s results demonstrate. With that, I’ll turn the call over to John.
James F. Palmer : My comments begin with Slide Five, I’ll discuss the fourth quarter and 2008 results, the goodwill impairment charge, update you on pension performance and then conclude with a discussion on our 2009 guidance. Our operating results for the fourth quarter were very strong as Ron has mentioned. As you know, I place a lot of emphasis on the importance of cash flow so I’m particularly pleased with our cash from operations and free cash flow results for the year. This year’s performance represents a new income conversion of 135% before the goodwill impairment charge. I’m very proud of what our team accomplished in 2008. Due to the strong year end collections, we reduced trade working capital even while increasing sales by 6%. We exceeded the high end of our guidance range by a substantial amount even after considering the $200 million of discretionary pension pre-funding. This quarter’s large goodwill impairment charge was driven by the dramatic decline in the equity markets. This caused a sharp decline in market multiples in our industry and for Northrup as well. As many of you are aware, the annual testing for goodwill impairment is a process that compares the fair value of each business to its recorded book value. We determined the fair value of each business based on its discounted cash flow forecast. Cash flows for each of the businesses change from year-to-year but the calculation is really dominated by the terminal year market multiple. Had market multiples on November 30, 2008 been at the same level that they were the prior year, November 2007, the goodwill for ship building and space technology would not have been impaired.  Moving on to pension on Slide Six, during last quarter’s call we gave you some sensitivities that we thought would be useful to model our 2009 pension costs. That model was based on a 7% discount rate and a -10% return. We also noted that at the time of our third quarter call in October, our planned investment returns was about -20%. Now, what happened?  Well, interest rates held fairly constant to that 7% level until the last couple of weeks of the year when they declined substantially, so the discount rate applies to year end pension liabilities turned out to be 6.25% which is lower than the model we provided to you. However, our investment returns improved in the fourth quarter. We ended the year with a negative return slightly more than -16% which is very strong relative performance.  Earlier in the year we decided to underweight equities, a decision that really paid off and reduced our investment losses from what they would have been by about $1.7 billion. Based on our actual plan returns and our expected CAS expense, we estimate that our net FAS/CAS pension adjustment in 2009 will be an expense of approximately $335 million or about $0.65 on a per share basis. Our underlying assumptions are an 8.5% long term rate of return and a discount rate of 6.25%. We also updated some of the underlying pension plan actuarial assumptions to reflect the current economic situation. The sensitivities we provided last quarter are before those changes in actuarial assumptions. I would also remind you that we absorbed the full 2008 asset valuation impact in the calculation of 2009 pension expense rather than smoothing the impact over several years as many of our major peers do. On a cash basis, our minimum pension funding requirements for 2009 is about $130 million. Our current plans call for an additional $500 million pension pre-funding in 2009. At the end of 2007, the funded status of our plan stood at about 104% and at the end of 2008 the funded status was 84%. This change in funded status results in a $2.8 billion reduction in shareholders’ equity on an after tax basis. Now, let’s move on to guidance on Slide Seven, our guidance for 2009 GAAP earnings per share is $4.50 to $4.75 versus the 2008 adjusted EPS excluding the goodwill impairment charge of $5.21. A significant driver of the year-over-year variance is the change in net pension adjustment from income of $263 million in 2008 to an expense of approximately $335 million in 2009. This nearly $600 million swing translates to about $1.20 on a per share basis.  Negative pension plan returns and our pension accounting method caused a largest distortion in our GAAP earnings comparison and as many of you know, under federal government cost accounting rules we are reimbursed over time for our pension costs through our contracts so it is really the cost accounting expense or CAS, pension expense that drives our margin rates along with ERISA, our pension related cash flows. For both of these reasons it makes much more sense to use pension adjusted EPS to understand Northrup Grumman’s underlying business trends. So on a pension adjusted basis, our earnings per share guidance for 2009 is $5.15 to $5.40 which represents growth of 9% to 15% over the 2008 pension adjusted EPS. The year-over-year improvement reflects a sales increase to approximately $34.5 billion, a higher pension adjusted operating income rate and a lower share count. These are partially offset by higher corporate unallocated expense and a reduction in other income due to the non-recurring nature of the patient infringement settlements in 2008. For 2009, we do expect higher sales but they will be offset somewhat by lower revenues in missiles, ship building and state and local IT which will, as I said, partially offset the growth in other businesses. We provided the same adjusted comparison for segment operating margin rate and operating margin rate so on an adjusted basis segment OM rate improves to the low to mid 9% range from 8.6%. So, we do expect segment margin rate expansion in 2009 which will be primarily driven by higher ship building margins.  Operating margin rate on a pension adjusted basis improves to the mid 8% range for 2009 from 7.9% in 2008. We expect GAAP reported margin in the mid 7% range and our expected tax rate is approximately 34%. Turning to cash generation, we expect another strong year of cash generation. Before any pre-funding of the plans we expect cash from operations in the range of $2.7 to $3.2 billion and free cash flow of $1.9 to $2.4 billion. For 2009 cash flows again will be weighted towards the second half of the year. During 2009 we plan to continue our balanced cash deployment strategy by investing in the business through disciplined capital expenditures as well as potential acquisitions. Managing the company’s liabilities including voluntary pension contributions will be an area of focus as well as returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. As Ron mentioned, we have $945 million remaining on our current repurchase authorization.  As many of you know, we have returned substantial cash to our shareholders. Over the last three years we have spent more than $3.5 billion to repurchase 48 million plus shares and we have doubled our dividend since 2003. So, in summary, putting aside the market multiple driven goodwill impairment charge, we had a very strong quarter and we ended the year with strong results and a solid foundation going in to 2009.  With that we’re ready for some questions.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Myles Walton – Oppenheimer & Co.
Myles Walton – Oppenheimer & Co.: Maybe Jim, I was wondering on the goodwill impairment if we can focus on that just for a second, there are two variables one is the market multiple and the other is future outlook for cash flows. You commented that if the November market multiple was the same as last year you wouldn’t have taken a charge but could you elaborate of there have been changes in your forecast for the future cash flows on a negative basis for the businesses that you took the charge on and what that might mean for the 2012 targets?
James F. Palmer : Myles, as I said there are always year-over-year changes in cash flows. The key driver as I said on the call this morning was market multiples. Again, the predominance of cash flow value is determined from the discounted cash flows is market multiple driven. There are some lower cash flows coming out of the businesses as I look at them today but again, the predominate driver is the terminal value market multiple applied to that terminal year and the five years of cash flows.
Myles Walton – Oppenheimer & Co.: So should we read anything in to the charge with respect to your 2012 targets?
James F. Palmer : No, I don’t think so.
Myles Walton – Oppenheimer & Co.: Then maybe another follow up for you Jim, on the pension expense how much is flowing through the segments in terms of CAS in 2009 as maybe a headwind to margins? And also, if you could comment on what FAS and CAS would look like in 2010 if everything kind of hit the plan.
James F. Palmer : CAS is increased in 2009 over 2008 about a 10% level. Those kind of rough numbers. On a go forward basis assuming we hit our 8.5% long term rate of return I would expect to see a small increase in FAS expense or a general increase or a consistent increase in CAS expense as we go through time. Clearly, the cost accounting standards have a much greater smoothing affect associated with them so anyone that had negative pension returns in 2008 will have higher CAS expense as we go through time over the next few years.
Myles Walton – Oppenheimer & Co.: Then Ron maybe a follow up for you with respect to capital deployment, could you comment on given your strong balance sheet and relatively no interest income coming in from any cash balances, the priority with respect to M&A has that ticked up at all or are you still more favored towards dividends or share repurchases at this point?
Ronald D. Sugar : Myles, I don’t see any change in our stance here. We’ve tried to maintain a balanced look here. We’ve done some very small M&A because of some extraordinary opportunities we’ve seen. We certainly will continue to look for those opportunities in the future but as we look at the balancing needs of share repurchase, pension pre-funding, some debt retirement, we’re going to continue to kind of balance it as we go. The 15% debt to total capital ratio is a good number. That’s not necessarily a target for us but we want to maintain a high degree of liquidity and flexibility in the next year or two just because I think, as everyone else, we want to make sure we’re adequately matched for whatever might come at us in the economy.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Cai von Rumohr – Cowen & Company.
Cai von Rumohr – Cowen & Company: Could you give us some more color Jim, you mentioned actuarial assumptions, briefly what were they and the impact on your FAS/CAS for 2009?
James F. Palmer : The actuarial assumptions Cai are much more driven to the FAS side than to the cost accounting side. The principal changes as I mentioned were tied economic assumptions. We have a cash balance feature to our pension plan and that cash balance feature has an interest rate applied to the balance that is credited to individual accounts and obviously with lower earning rates we thought it made sense to reflect what we are going to see as actual credits for the cash balance plan in the near term and then trending back up to more historical levels. We also expect that for a sharp period of time we’re going to see a delay in early retirements given economic situations so we reflected a slide in the period of time we expect to see those early retirements. Then the final assumption really deal with salary scale and again, given the economic situation we thought there is going to be a little bit of delay in the growth in salary scale as compared to what we had seen in the past. Those assumptions essentially tended to somewhat mitigate the change in the discount rate from the 7% level that we had assumed at the end of the third quarter to the 6.25% that we ended up at the end of the year.
Cai von Rumohr – Cowen & Company: Last one, could you give us some color no where we expect royalty, general corporate and other income in 2009?
James F. Palmer : We had a very successful year in 2008 in resolving a number of the patient infringement suits where those are largely behind us in this point of time so I don’t expect any kind of significant level of royalty income. We traditionally have a few million a year but it is really just that, on a normal run rate a few million a year. The other expense piece of the other net again is largely influenced by the non-qualified benefits that we have and to a certain extent that is market driven. From a planning perspective I am looking at an additional cost there for this year.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Joseph Nadol – J. P. Morgan.
Joseph Nadol – J. P. Morgan: On the sales outlook, I thought the numbers were a little bit light and you were looking for a little bit less than 2% sales growth for 2009 and I guess taking a step back you have a $42 billion target out there for 2012 so we’re looking at lower than 2% growth in 2009 and then that would need to step up to 7% [cager] the subsequent three years to get to that level. I know you’re excited about your backlog and the outlook but obviously there’s uncertainty in the budget. What would you say Ron on how you feel about that outlook right now?
James F. Palmer : Let me take the near term piece of it and then I’ll turn it over to Ron for the longer term piece. As I mentioned in my comments, we do see sales growth to the $34.5 million level, I can expect that some of you maybe thought that the sale growth could be higher. There are, as I mentioned in my prepared comments three areas where there are some significant declines in revenues on a year-over-year basis between ’08 and ’09. They are in the ships area where we have essentially a dip in activity as we complete the Bush and then transition to the new Ford carrier as well as completing the RCOH on Vincent and then transitioning to the Roosevelt.  Likewise, we see a decline in missiles resulting from basically a completion of activity around the IPIP program and then finally as both Wes and I commented, lower revenues in the state and local arena. Those three areas are probably about a $800 million decline on year-over-year basis. 
Ronald D. Sugar : Let me just tag on to that in terms of the long term. A year ago we laid out what we thought ought to be reasonable targets to address given our then understanding of the defense market, the economic world that we are in and frankly also the pension performance market that we thought we might be able to continue to have. Clearly, we have a different environment now however, I will tell you that our view of the opportunities for the long term margin rates that we think we can achieve in this business has not changed.
Joseph Nadol – J. P. Morgan: How about the top line Ron? It sounds like you’re maybe coming off that number but do you expect the top line growth to accelerate I guess from 2% to more like a mid single digit number or is that something you don’t want to address right now?
Ronald D. Sugar : I can’t address beyond the guidance we’ve given for ’09. Clearly we want to see how the 2012 budget and the QDR layout and the 2011 budget. I think that frankly will be a more important determiner of top line. At this point in time we’re reasonably comfortable that our program set is solid but like everybody else we’re going to wait and see how the President’s budget actually lays out for 2010 and beyond.
Joseph Nadol – J. P. Morgan: Then just on the same lines, and Jim thanks for the color on the sales but, along the same lines just looking at the margins, just the company segment margin overall coming in to 2008 we were looking at mid to high 9s and then obviously there was the LHD 8 issue and a number of other pluses and minuses but your base line expectation for the business excluding all that stuff was mid to high 9s. Now, we’re coming in to 2009 looking for low to mid 9s. How would you characterize the difference in the outlook one year ago today going in to 2008 versus today just given the mix of businesses and frankly the lack of items that are affecting either one?
James F. Palmer : As I think about our forecast or guidance for this year it’s really based on what I see today. Clearly, there are always risk and opportunities, we intend to address those as we go through time. We’ll update you as those opportunities are realized and we mitigate the risk. I think as Ron said, our view of the long term margin opportunities for these businesses still holds, it really hasn’t changed so we are essentially confirming that long term opportunity view of margin rates. In terms of year-over-year change, as Miles or Cai asked previously there is some growth in CAS, cost accounting, pension costs. As we looked forward we tried to reflect our view of the impact of those costs in to our expectations for margins in 2009 as well.
Joseph Nadol – J. P. Morgan: Let me slip one more in, the ship building margin outlook, you’re at 8%ish, you did better than that in the fourth quarter and I guess things look like they’re working their way up a little bit on performance but, certainly in terms of LHD 8. I’m wondering are you being conservative there because of that transition you talked about there in your sales outlook or is there something else going on?
James F. Palmer : That is a impact in 2009. Let me just comment a little bit on 2008 fourth quarter margins which were frankly strong at 9%. We did have some risk retirement on VCS, the submarine program Block-2 which contributed to earnings as well as Mike Petters and his team have really actively managed overhead throughout 2008 in anticipation of the dip in revenues in 2009 and so frankly we had some favorable performance on actual 2008 overheads versus what our expectations were, all of which were positive contributors to earnings in the fourth quarter.  Again, as I look forward in to 2009, I know we have the dip in revenues that has an impact on overhead absorption. I do see improvement, underlying improvement in the operations of the ship yards, all of which have been reflected in our guidance for margin rates for 2009.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Joseph Campbell – Barclays Capital.
Joseph Campbell – Barclays Capital: Ron, could you talk philosophically and kind of managerially about what this reorganization that you announced earlier in the month really means and sort of what was behind it? Some of it looks like it was sort of integration that might have happened a long time ago when you bought [TRW] but maybe personalities or management wasn’t quite ready for the shift but others of them, I’m not quite sure what’s going on with some of these groupings and maybe you could just shed some light on that.
Ronald D. Sugar : Obviously over time all companies reorganize and as I mentioned in my initial comments, your structure needs to follow your strategy and as we look at becoming even more competitive and being able to more agilely deploy talent to different major programs both either capture them or execute on them, it struck Wes and me that the combinations of a couple of these units would be something we ought to go forward and do. It creates some larger entities but they do have more critical mass. Let me just take the two key combinations which we’ve done. By putting our two aerospace businesses together, our aircraft and our space business which are by the way, largely collocated within a couple of miles of each other here in Southern California. We see an opportunity to very substantially improve the ability to move talent between the businesses, we see an opportunity to pursue the strategic initiatives involving the space and air continuum and strategic ISR.  We think between unmanned vehicles and space there’s going to be more trades between those. And frankly, also the ability to eliminate certain back office costs which we just don’t need to have here going forward. I think we are at the point, I think you made an observations about the maturity of the integration, we are at a point now where culturally and a people standpoint this makes sense and we can do this. The other area which area which we are very excited about is the combination of our mission systems and our information technologies sector in to the new information systems sector under Linda Mills and this will also be about a $10 billion entity. This again is a structure following strategy. We found that over time the two businesses while we had made some efforts to partition where they went in fact did find themselves in the market place having to work together in a way which was awkward and we found that we could bring greater critical mass to our customers by actually realigning and putting this all under one common management, under one roof if you will. Again, the opportunity for significant synergies, these two businesses are largely located in Northern Virginia, although they have multiple sites there and an opportunity in addition to agile deployment of people and talent and massing for major bids, the ability to take some costs out as well. This just seemed the right sort of things to do. I might also mention Joe that through the other sectors that are unaffected and also the corporation as a whole, we’re continuing to look at how to streamline to become more agile and more competitive. We think the environment demands it. Frankly, we’re getting ahead of it and we think it’s the right thing to do.
Joseph Campbell – Barclays Capital: Ron, just one other question and I don’t mean this in a mean spirited way in any way but Northrup is the only company that had these impairment charges. Is there something different about either the amount of goodwill or the growth rate for ships that somehow led Northrup to be unique in taking the big impairment? I mean, there was a ton of M&A but we haven’t seen anybody else do it and it just sort of strikes me that it is just sort of another example of Northrup being a little different?
Ronald D. Sugar : Let my buddy here Jim Palmer answer that question. I think he can give you a pretty concise answer.
James F. Palmer : A couple of observations Joe, we are not the only ones that have taken goodwill impairment charges. There are others in our industry, although smaller who have taken goodwill impairment charge, Harris for one example. Other observations, as we mentioned at our investor conference last year when we talked about goodwill and RONA and its impact on goodwill and its impact on RONA, our acquisitions largely were completed towards the end of the cycle defense industry acquisitions largely completed after the adoption of 142, the new standard which did not allow the amortization of goodwill that some of our other competitors who had purchased transactions amortized goodwill.  Some of them had pooling transactions if we go further back where there really wasn’t any goodwill associated or recorded with those transactions. We did end up with proportionately more goodwill than many of our competitors due to the timing of our acquisitions and we did not have the opportunity to amortize any of the goodwill, or much of the goodwill unlike our competitors. So those are two historical factors that are important and then as I mentioned it really is our view of market multiples for each of our businesses that drove the actual impairment charge this year.
Joseph Campbell – Barclays Capital: Just a follow up, with regard to the way that you measure yourself on RONA and the returns, do you think you were previously being sort of penalized relative to the industry benchmarks because of these things you’ve gone through or because you’ve now taken these charges will you for purposes of compensation and so on based on return type metrics adjust it back up as if you hadn’t written it off because of course if you right it up [inaudible].
James F. Palmer : Our intention on a go forward basis is to revise the base line for the RONA portion of our long term goal to reflect the lower base if you will so the bar will be increased as we go through time. RONA is just one of the two long term measures of our long term plan, the other is operating margin dollars accumulative over the three year period. There may be a benefit on one side, there’s a cost on the other.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Ronald Epstein – BAS-ML.
Ronald Epstein – BAS-ML: Ron, just a follow up on some of your initial remarks, you mentioned the opportunity in cyber security, do you mind to elaborate on that? Potentially how big of a market is it and what do you guys bring to the space?
Ronald D. Sugar : Well, at this point in time Ron it’s hard to really quantify it for a lot of reasons, first of all it’s huge. A lot of it is something that is visible, a lot of it that may in fact not be visible. As we look at our understanding of where the Department of Defense and the Intelligence Agency are putting future money on their plans, we see an increasing part of it being in cyber security which relates to not only protection against cyber threats but also dealing with the broader issue of cyber warfare going forward. So, certainly this is a multibillion dollar sort of opportunity at large. It has ramifications frankly for not just defense purposes but also for other civilian agencies that have to deal with security of their own networks so there is a lot of work to be done here. The company is remarkably positioned with the skills we bring in this area. This is an area we’ve been working on for a long time and have a very, very strong market position and we see this improving. I’ll give you an example of one area where we’ve been able to expand this that we’ve been talking about and that is our acquisition of Essex. Essex was a company that was focused on this area and since our acquisition we have seen that business have a dramatic increase in demand for what they’re doing and I think that’s just representative of what we see. So, the short answer is I can’t give you a precise dollar number but I can tell you it’s billions and billions.
Ronald Epstein – BAS-ML: Then how do you think about – there’s also commercial contractors who work in that space, are they competitors, are they potential folks you could team up with, are they potential M&A candidates?
Ronald D. Sugar : I think more people we can team up with Ron. You think about where we would be addressing our attention would be largely to the defense and intelligence space, those markets which we understand extremely well and where we can partner with a commercial competitor to do that better, that’s great. In general, we do have some special and unique skills as a result of our deep understanding of intelligence and defense that many of the other commercial players do not have and frankly we are also not primarily interested in addressing the commercial market for our services, that is helping other companies with their internal security threats. So, I think more an opportunity for collaboration Ron than competition.
Ronald Epstein – BAS-ML: Then finally, when we think about the opportunity set in maybe the more near term, what could happen in say the next six to nine months, what is that laundry list of things we should keep an eye on?
Ronald D. Sugar : Well, I think Wes gave you a set of targets that we’re pursuing. I think we’ll look for the restart of tanker at some point although we don’t expect that will be a 2009 event. As Wes talked about, the F16 radar work could be significant. We have work on E2 that we might be able to bring in internationally, CANES, EPX, ACS, the TSAT competition is a big one for us and our partner Lockheed that should be able to get we think off the dime here later in the year and of course the down select process on GPS OCX. Those are kind of the trigger points we’re looking at and in addition a whole raft of follow ons of our franchise program work which would go in to our future backlog.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Robert Springarn – Credit Suisse.
Robert Springarn – Credit Suisse: Could you talk a little bit about the nice changes we saw in unfunded backlog in the quarter particularly in space and I think in tech services as well?
Wesley G. Bush : Let me just say a few words across the board, much of that growth in unfunded backlog comes from our success in building on follow on activities to long standing programs that we have in the company. Ron talked a little bit about it for ships, space was similar, tech services has a little bit of that but when you combine that success in building on those franchise programs with the successes that we’ve had that I described on the competitive front, together those generated a record year of backlog growth for us.  So, it was really the combination of those two things, both competitive and the benefit of having large scale franchise programs that we can continue to build on.
Robert Springarn – Credit Suisse: Then in contrast to some commentary on the lighter aspects of your’09 revenue guidance perhaps in ships and a couple of other spots, ES looks real good, real strong there. Can you talk about that? Ron, can you talk about any major opportunities perhaps that can enhance any of the segments in this fiscal year?
Ronald D. Sugar : Well, obviously electronics went through a couple of years of flattening a few years ago and we put a real press along with Jim Pitts on improving our competitiveness there. They’ve been knocking the lights out in that area and they’ve been adding backlog and you can see that they’re sales are growing accordingly. As you know, it’s an extraordinarily well performing business with very good margins. We see a few opportunities as we go through. We’ve outlined most of the individual ones already and we’ll just sort of watch and see. When we build a plan we have to make some assumptions about how funding gets metered out. We’re also not mindful of the fact that some of the programs that we have in our plans could have some stretches associated with them, others could potentially be accelerated and what we’ve given you here is guidance which reflects kind of our integrated view of how that will all play out for the year.  If it turns out that there are not stretches or slips or no reductions in funding then we could have some upsides. If we were to see a program or two significantly delayed or an award put off that could have an impact on the other side. But, I think the numbers we’ve guided to the $34.5 billion are about our best guess at this point in time. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Richard Safran – Goldman Sachs.
Richard Safran – Goldman Sachs: You mentioned substantial opportunities in the restricted area in your opening remarks and in 2008 good classified bookings so based on what opportunities you are watching and I’m assuming you’re doing some type of internal expected value calculation, can you comment directionally on what you think 2009 classified bookings might be like? I also ask this in the context of your comments pertaining to a more stringent bid criteria?
Ronald D. Sugar : Richard, I really can’t give you any more color on that for obvious reasons. I will emphasis Wes’ comments about more stringent bid criteria. It turns out in our restrictive business we often find that to be our business that gives us the greatest opportunities to bid the kind of ways we want to bid, it’ some of the other programs that we need to put additional attention on in terms of bid criteria. We’re going to use them across the whole spectrum of what we bid but I wouldn’t single out restricted as an example there.
Operator:  Your next question comes from David Strauss – UBS.
David Strauss – UBS: Just to clarify on your EPS guidance, I think Ron you had talked about that on pension adjusted basis it implies high single digit low double digit kind of growth but just to be clear, if you adjust for the ship building charge last year it looks like flat to just slightly higher EPS growth. Is that correct?
James F. Palmer : David, the way I think about it is ’08 did have some unusual items in it. You can’t just take the first quarter shipping charge because we had some offsets or some reversals of that charge in the third and fourth quarter and we also had roughly $60 million of royalty or patent infringement settlements so when I net all that down, that is about a $200 million impact to segment margin rate. So, the way I think about it essentially is I have part of that operational improvement that is the absence of all of that net item and then margin improvement and sales growth associated with the balance.
David Strauss – UBS: So Jim, just so I’m clear, you’re saying it’s roughly $350 million in charges you took in ships and then you’ve got about $150 million of positive that nets out to the negative $200?
James F. Palmer : Let me go through the exact numbers with you. $326 million in the first quarter offset by $63 million of pick up or reversals in the third and fourth quarter on LHD 8 for a net of $263 on LHD 8 for the year. Then, $59 or $60 million of patent infringement settlements that again, kind of one time impact that net the $200 million. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from Troy Lahr – Stifel Nicolaus & Company.
Troy Lahr – Stifel Nicolaus & Company: I was just wondering if you guys could talk a little bit about your international sales. Some of the other companies have done a pretty good job of just breaking that out and kind of talking about some of the opportunities in growth there. Could you do the same?
Ronald D. Sugar : Well, as you know we have probably 7% or 8% of our sales in international. This is probably lower than some of the other players, at one time Northrup historically had almost half of its sales internationally, this was quite a number of years before my time. We do have a number of opportunities, a lot of our opportunities are on the electronics area which is our largest international participant.  We do see opportunities for programs such as E2 perhaps in the Middle East. We have some new opportunities there, we have some discussions in India. The F16 SABRE radar which is a new modernization, upgrade to the radars of F16s for the fleet that is deployed around the world, is very significant for us and while there wouldn’t necessarily be sales of new aircraft there would be total replacement of radars and that could be a significant opportunity for our electronic folks as well.
Troy Lahr – Stifel Nicolaus & Company: Do you see that 7% to 8% growing? Is there a certain target that you have out there? Do you think it could get up to 10%?
Ronald D. Sugar : We’ve said for several years that we have not set and I have not set a specific target that says we need to achieve a certain fraction of our portfolio. We’ve got to go where the market is for what we can do well and make money at and my guess is that our proportion will probably remain about there for the next year or two. What I would like to do now is a couple of closing remarks. Basically I’d like to reiterate that mentioned at the beginning, Paul Gregory will be taking the investor relations role from Gaston. Paul has been the Chief Financial Officer at our space technology sector until this point in time and a long term Northrup executive. I do want to thank Gaston, this completes his 64th quarterly conference call over the last 16 years and I think one or two of you said he has some battle scars and deserves some medals and we would certainly agree with that. We very much want to thank you Gaston for your service to the company and to the wall street community as well. You’ve been a fixture and you’re probably the longest serving investor relations guy, at least in our industry, maybe in the universe for all we know. Gaston will not be disappearing, we’re going to use Gaston’s perspective and his market focus to help us in the next couple of years as we think through how we can focus on some competitive initiatives across the corporation and Gaston will bring his knowledge and a sharp scalpel with him as we go forward in that effort. We very much appreciate Gaston your help. That ladies and gentlemen completes our call. Thank you for your interest and we’ll talk to you next quarter.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Northrop Grumman Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. My name is Carissa [ph] and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of today's conference. [Operator Instructions]. I'll now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's conference, Mr. Gaston Kent, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.
Gaston Kent - Vice President of Investor Relations: Thank you Carissa, and good morning everyone. Welcome to Northrop Grumman's third quarter 2008 conference call. We've provided supplemental information in the form of a PowerPoint presentation that you can access on our Investor Relations website at northropgrumman.com. The presentation will be available for a limited time and should be viewed in conjunction with today's commentary. Before we start, please understand that as shown on slide two, some of the matters discussed on this call constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements reflect the company's views with respect to future events and prospective financial performance. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties and the actual results of the company may differ materially from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. A more complete expression of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the company's SEC filings including Forms 10-K and the 10-Q which was filed this morning. During the call, we'll discuss third quarter results, including the non-GAAP measures, segment operating income, and segment operating margin and free cash flow both of which are reconciled in our press release. During today's call, we'll also discuss the outlook for the remainder of 2008. Guidance will include GAAP measures of sales, operating margin, earnings per share from continuing operations, cash from operations and non-GAAP measures, segment operating margin rate and free cash flow. On the call today are our Chairman and CEO, Ron Sugar; our President and COO, Wes Bush; and our Chief Financial Officer, Jim Palmer. Please go to slide three, and at this time I would like to turn the call over to Ron.
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Gaston, and hello everyone. Thanks for joining us. We're very pleased with our strong third quarter results. Sales and earnings per share both grew by 6%. These are solid improvements but the highlights of this quarter are cash generation, new business awards, and our record backlog. Cash from operations totaled $1.4 billion and free cash flow totaled $1.2 billion. Strong cash generation and our ample liquidity supported the continued execution of our balance cash deployment strategy. During the third quarter we purchased more than 10.8 million shares of our stock bringing our year-to-date share repurchases to approximately 21.2 million shares. At the end of the quarter we had approximately $960 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization. Shortly after the end of the quarter we purchased 3001 International, a strategically important IT sector acquisition that will significantly complement our current core geospatial business with its strong geospatial data collection processing and production capabilities. We ended the quarter with a record backlog of more than $70 billion. New business awards in the quarter totaled $11.5 billion and include new competitive awards as well as follow-ons to some of our large franchise programs. This brings year-to-date new business awards to more than $31 billion nearly equal to our 2007 annual sales. During the quarter, we were awarded a $5 billion cost type construction contract for CVN 78, the USS Gerald R. Ford, the Navy's next generation Aircraft Carrier. Our second quarter awarded the Navy's $1.2 billion Broad Area Maritime Surveillance contract or BAMS was upheld by the GAO and we are underway now on that program. In addition to new awards, we also achieved some notable program events during the quarter including completion of the electrical cabling milestone on the LHD-8. We are very pleased with how that program is progressing and we have increasing confidence in the delivery schedule for this ship. Wes will provide more color on this in a minute. I also want to take a minute to comment on the air force tanker program. Clearly, as the wining bidder it's disappointing that the competition has been deferred. We are also genuinely disappointed on behalf of the men and women who urgently need a new tanker. The air force chose the right tanker during the first competition and we are convinced that when we compete again we will win again. We continue to have a very robust opportunity set in addition to the tanker. The down select on the multibillion dollar joint like tactical vehicle program is imminent. Also on the horizon are programs like Aerial Common Sensor, GPS Next Generation Ground Control segment, Vehicular Intercommunications Segment Next Generation and other substantial new opportunities including restricted programs. Before I conclude I want to take a moment to comment on the turbulence in the capital markets, the responses from the federal government and how Northrop Grumman is likely to fair going forward. Our business is characterized by long-term contracts that support national security priorities. We believe military spending priorities and specific program spending plans are primarily threat driven. These threats will exist regardless of the changing political or economic backdrops. Overall Northrop Grumman's programs were well funded in the recently past 2009 defense budget. While we are mindful that the higher level of Federal Government spending through the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act and other Federal financial support programs make pressure defense spending, the budgetary process gives us good visibility regarding future spending and the threats being addressed. We believe that our strong contract backlog is well aligned with the direction of our nation's future security needs. The recent market turmoil has demonstrated the importance of liquidity and access to the capital markets. It is also heightened our level of vigilance regarding the financial health of our suppliers and our pension plan investment returns. While no business is completely immune to these pressures, we believe our backlog, cash generation and credit facilities will allow us to continue to grow despite these challenges. So in conclusion, this was a strong quarter in which we generated higher sales, earnings, free cash flow, and new awards. Based on that strength we are raising our 2008 guidance for sales and earnings per share. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Wes Bush. Wes?
Wes Bush - President and Chief Operating Officer: Thanks Ron. Hello everyone. My comments today are outlined on slide 4, and we'll focus on two key thrusts of our operating improvement efforts: business capture and program execution. We put tremendous effort into enhancing our business capture operations over the past several years and the results are showing. A key indicator of course is the growth in our contractual backlog which now stands at over $70 billion. Key wins this year such as BAMS demonstrate the competitive improvements in our process. But as importantly, we're driving to improve the quality of our new contracts through adherence to our new more stringent bid criteria. We are not bidding on programs unless they meet those criteria. And you can see the effects of this for example in our declining sales and backlog in the commercial state and local business of our IT sector. So we're being more selective, our total backlog is growing and the quality of that backlog is improving. Program execution is also a key operating priority in the company. And here too we're making progress in our portfolio of over 20,000 programs as we integrate stronger risk management methodologies into our program management processes. We are making good progress and retiring risk on our key watch-list programs. On Block 60 we met our milestone for delivery of the EW3 software in the quarter, and we continue to perform to plan. On Wedgetail we are ready to enter type acceptance testing once clearance is obtained from the customer. And we've reduced the staffing on the effort while we await this go ahead in order to maintain performance within the EAC. During the quarter we undertook an extensive review of the risk on the New York City wireless program and we determined that while we're making very good progress, cost to complete the work has increased. Some of this relates to our estimate of additional cost that we may incur to ensure that we can obtain the equipment and the support that's needed to complete the program from a key sub contractor who is currently experiencing some financial difficulties. In addition to these potential subcontractor related costs, the provision also reflects a revised estimate to complete the program. As build out has progressed we've encountered cost growth associated with site completions and some slower regulatory permitting which is extended in network completion schedule into the first half of next year. We believe this revised estimate appropriately reflects the remaining work as we've made good progress towards completion of the program. The technical performance is outstanding and we've already achieved 90% coverage of the city with the network. Our ship building team is making solid progress. Our submarine and aircraft carrier programs are going very well. We suffered some downtime in our Gulf Cost operations duet to Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike caused damage at the subcontractor facility that builds compartments for LPDs 22 and 23. Our team has taken aggressive management actions to minimize these hurricane impacts. I'm very pleased to report on the outstanding progress that we are making on our HTA [ph]. Timely accomplishment of the third quarter electrical cabling milestone was absolutely critical and it totally supports our delivery timeline. As a result of this progress we returned some program reserve to profit in the quarter. We are on track to complete the pier side integration propulsion testing this quarter as well. Based on this excellent progress to date we are working with the Navy to potentially accelerate builder trials and trial readiness reviews are already underway with the Navy's program team. So despite some issues including some externally driven challenges, we are making good progress and continual improvements in program execution and the quarter results demonstrate that the portfolio is operating well. So with that I will turn it over to Jim.
James F. Palmer - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks Wes. Good morning ladies and gentlemen, during my comments I will discuss sales and provide some color on margin rate and cash trends and then I will review 2008 guidance and then provide some thoughts regarding 2009 trends with some particular discussion on 2009 pension expense. To begin on slide five, I want to provide my perspective on what is a very strong quarter. Our underlying fundamentals continue to be very strong as evidenced by higher sales, net earnings, free cash flow, record backlog, strong liquidity and access to capital. Earnings per share are 6% better than last year; last year did include a $0.06 per share gain from the AMSEC reorganization so without that $0.06 gain of last year's third quarter earnings this quarter's year-over-year improvement would have actually been 11%. And when netted against each other the unusual items in this year's third quarter, New York City wireless the hurricane impacts that Wes talked about and the positive items, the royalty settlements and tax credits generated a $0.02 reduction in this quarter's earnings and the tax credits were anticipated in our guidance for the year. Risk mitigation and program execution continue to be the highest priority of our senior management team. Across the company we are working diligently to reduce and retire program risk on programs so that our execution and financial results become much more predictable. This quarter we also took a more conservative approach to program risk assessment particularly at our Gulf Coast shipyards which resulted in the lowering of booking rates on a number of those programs. And finally, we're working hard to ensure that we negotiate contracts that appropriately reflect the risk inherent in that work. As you all know, no amount of good performance can overcome a poor contract. Moving on to slide 6, sales for information and services, aerospace, and electronics, are all up over last year and on a consolidated basis sales were up more than 6%. The third quarter sales trends for information and services and aerospace are consistent with what we've seen throughout the year. The increase though in electronics is largely due to increased deliveries in the third quarter. And the decline in ship building is due to Hurricane Gustav which required the closure of our Gulf Coast shipyards for more than a week and reduced sales by approximately $100 million in the quarter. Year-to-date shipbuilding sales were up 11% and for the year we now expect their sales would total approximately $6.1 billion which exceeds our prior guidance of $5.7 billion to $5.9 billion. We also expect higher sales for aerospace than our previous guidance, which was $9.3 billion to $9.5 billion. We now expect aerospace sales will total approximately $9.7 billion. And electronic sales were expected to be about $7 billion. This is at the low end of our prior range and simply reflects the sales of the electrical... Electro-Optical Systems business earlier this year. So based on year-to-date results in the increased expectations for shipbuilding and aerospace we are increasing our guidance for 2008 sales to $33.4 billion. On a consolidated basis, segment operating margin totaled 9.2% compared to 10.4% last year. After adjusting for unusual items the underlying segment operating margin rate this quarter is fairly consistent with last year. Last year's rate of 10.4% when adjusted for the $67 million in shipbuilding positives and at 22 million information technology charge equates to 9.8%. This quarter's rate would have been 9.7% before the $40 million patent infringement settlement in the New York City wireless charge and the hurricane impacts. Below the segment line, improvements in unallocated expenses and net pension expense were offset by the decline in operating income and the reversal of the royalty income leaving us with a total operating margin rate of 9.2% for the quarter. Looking at the year-end total we now expect both segment margin rate and total operating margin rate to be in the mid 8% range. This adjustment to prior guidance contemplates a margin rate of mid 7% for information and services versus the prior guidance of low 8% and a mid 2% range for our shipbuilding versus the guidance of approximately 3% to 4%. The reduction in the shipbuilding rate is largely hurricane driven. Moving to taxes, our effective tax rate declined to 31.4% in the quarter primarily due to the settlement of TRW tax audits for the years 1999 through 2002 which had been anticipated in our tax rate guidance for the year. During the third quarter we recognized tax credits of about $21 million primarily attributable to the settlement and with the passage of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 and the renewal of the R&D tax credit, we now expect an effective tax rate for the year of about 33.5%. Looking at cash on slide 7, cash from operations was just outstanding at approximately $1.4 billion for the quarter, a substantial improvement over last year's $1 billion mark. In the quarter trade working capital improved by more than $400 million reflecting a continued emphasis on managing working capital as well as the successful resolution of billing transition issues we discussed on previous call this year. Year-to-date, trade working capital was essentially flat while the company is growing by 6%. After capital spending and outsourcing contract cost, free cash flow improved to $1.2 billion. This translates to a net income conversion rate of a 128% on a year-to-date basis. Slide 8 summarizes our updated guidance for 2008. We now, as I said expect sales of $33.4 billion and earnings per share of $5.10 to $5.20. Our guidance for cash from operations remains at $2.6 billion to $2.9 billion and for free cash flow we have targeted a net income conversion of greater than a 100% for the year. The lower end of our free cash flow range has improved by $100 million to $1.8 million while the upper end remains at $2.1 billion. This cash from operations and free cash flow guidance includes a $120 million for required pension contributions. We are contemplating the additional voluntary contributions to the pension plans which would reduce reported cash from operations and free cash flow. Looking ahead to next year, I'd like to take a moment to provide some perspective on 2009 FAS and CAS pension expense including some sensitivities. Chart 9 in your package summarizes my comments. As you know 2009 FAS pension expense will be determined based on actual investment rates for 2008 and the discount rate as of December 31st. And as you know unlike many of our peers we have had a long term historical practice of using actual fair market value of planned assets at year-end to determine our next years expected investment returns. Through September 30th, our actual investment returns were a negative 12%. Although significantly different than our long-term investment rate of return assumption of 8.5%, it is decidedly better than the market in general. And this return is also significantly different than our long-term historical experience. Over the last 30 plus years we have realized a compound rate of return of about 11% annually in our pension plan. Earlier this year we made a change in our investment policy significantly reducing our... the equity rating. This has been a beneficial change as equities have underperformed the other investment classes this year. Now let's talk a bit about how this performance will be reflected in future pension expense. With the current market volatility, a lot can happen between now and the end of the year but we had previously modeled a negative 10% investment return on planned assets for 2008 compared with that 8.5% long-term rate of return assumption and a discount rate of 7% versus the 6.25% that we used at the end of the last year. And frankly if we were setting these rates at 9.30, the discount rate for example would likely have been higher. But as I said we set these rates at the end of the year. But under these modeled conditions and recognizing the differences in the individual plans our net 2009 FAS/CAS pension adjustment would be an expense of about $165 million compared to income in 2008 of about $250 million. I think it's also to provide... I think it's also important that I provide some sensitivities to these modeled assumptions. I must caution you however that these sensitivities are unique to our situation and this model. As you may know, cumulative pension gains and losses are first absorbed into a quarter equal to the greater of 10% of planned assets while projected benefits with any excess gain or loss then amortized into an expense. So these sensitivities are relatively linear once we are outside that 10% corridor. So with every 100 basis points move at a variance around the assumed negative 10% investment return we see a change of approximately $40 million in estimated 2009 FAS expense. Like wise for every 25 basis point change in the assumed 7% discount rate it results in a change of approximately $50 million in estimated 2009 FAS expense. In addition if we decided to pre-fund our pension plans between now and early 2009, we would further reduce our 2009 FAS expense by $8.5 million for every $100 million of voluntary pension funding. In looking at 2009 CAS expense and required cash contributions we do not expect to see the same level of volatility as CAS and cash are less sensitive to the current market movement until we reach a breakpoint somewhere above a minus or a negative 20% investment return. So let me pause and then just transition to some comments about the overall outlook for 2009. As you know we will give a specific guidance with our fourth quarter earnings call as is our normal practice. But I would like to give you some indication of trends that we currently see. Regarding total operating margin rate, as we discussed, given the current marketing conditions we expect the net FAS/CAS pension adjustment to increase, become negative actually in 2009. Secondly, we expect substantial improvement in shipbuilding margins. Thirdly, we don't expect the same level of royalty income as we have seen in 2008, and for sales we expect to see continued growth now based on our new business awards and strong backlog that we've experienced on a year-to-date basis. And finally I would expect that the strong cash generation capability of the company to continue into 2009. Gaston, I think with that we are ready to turn it back over to you for questions and answers.
Gaston Kent - Vice President of Investor Relations: Great, thanks Jim. Carissa, we are ready to go. Q and A please. Question And Answer
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from the line of Joe Nadol of J.P. Morgan. Please proceed.
Joseph Nadol - J.P. Morgan: Thanks, good morning.
James F. Palmer - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Good morning Joe.
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Hi Joe.
Joseph Nadol - J.P. Morgan: First question is on backlog and bookings. It looks like some good performance. The one area there that looks like it was down a little bit is Space. I was just wondering if you could comment on some of the things going on in Space, we've seen some delayed programs and that sort of things, any color would be helpful?
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: This is Ron, Space tends to come in lumps so it tends to be a variable. So in a given quarter you may not see much, next quarter you may see a significant amount to small number of large programs. I think that's probably the way to explain that.
Joseph Nadol - J.P. Morgan: Right. Just a little bit of trend though, I am looking at the nine months number and big picture with TSAT, looking like its getting pushed out, any thoughts Ron, big picture on the industry.
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, obviously TSAT will put some pressure on our future growth in that area, on the other hand we have a lot of other things cooking as well Joe. So I would say that what you are seeing is basically the quarter-to-quarter fluctuations and awards.
Joseph Nadol - J.P. Morgan: Okay and then secondly on the LHD 8, Wes, you mention that there was a slight reversal of the reserve into profit. Can you quantify that and can you give us a sense as to how much more opportunity there might be if you continue to hit these milestones.
Wes Bush - President and Chief Operating Officer: Yes, Joe. As I said we are making really good progress on LHD 8. We had a positive $34 million on the return to profit in the quarter because of the progress we have made to date. At the same time though we took a change in the booking rates, a more conservative approach looking across our full set of shipped programs, but essentially offset it, it was a little bit more. I think it was around 36 million.
Joseph Nadol - J.P. Morgan: Right.
Wes Bush - President and Chief Operating Officer: And so together we view that as an appropriate way of looking at where we are on the programs. LHD 8 continues to perform well. I wouldn't want to speculate on what the future might hold in that regard as we go forward because we still have some very important milestones to accomplish and finally we are delineated in my remarks on that slide. But I am feeling better and better about how we're doing as we continue to clip these milestones off.
Joseph Nadol - J.P. Morgan: Okay. So just to be clear the 36, how is that really to the... the 16 million that you noted in your press release on the subcontractor disruption that's exclusive of that, it was the three independent items?
James F. Palmer - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Three independent items, yes Joe. The hurricane impacts essentially Gustav was 16, Ike was 11, and then you have the LHD 8 for...
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Gustav was 11, Ike was 16.
James F. Palmer - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, I'm sorry. Hurricane effects were 27, and then you had LHD-8 for a positive 34 and approach on a... essentially a risk assessment or a more conservative risk assessment on the other programs of a minus 36.
Joseph Nadol - J.P. Morgan: Okay. And then, during that note finally I'll let someone else go. On that 36, what were the drivers of the adjustment there? Was it workforce buffer --?
James F. Palmer - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: It really is taking a more conservative view of the risk associated with the programs, looking at each of the individual contracts and the risk associated with completing them. As you guys know, shipbuilding is characterized by programs or contracts that take many years to complete. And so we just thought it was appropriate to be a little bit more conservative in our view about the risk of completing those programs.
Joseph Nadol - J.P. Morgan: Okay, thank you.
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Jeff.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton of Oppenheimer. Please proceed.
Myles Walton - Oppenheimer & Co.: Thanks, good morning.
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, Myles.
Wes Bush - President and Chief Operating Officer: Hi Myles.
Myles Walton - Oppenheimer & Co.: So I want to talk about pension a little bit. So first, can you give us where the plan is as of today, given the October market performance? Can you give us a hand there?
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Let's see Myles. Easy to get for the end of September, we were minus 12 at the end of September. The market performance in October as you know has been poor. Our estimate at this point would take that minus 12 to about a minus 20, maybe 21. It's really... but it's hard to get those exact numbers because of... for example, alternatives you don't value on a daily basis. But it looks like kind of the minus 20 to minus 21.
Myles Walton - Oppenheimer & Co.: Okay. And then you mentioned a 20% breakpoint, which I guess you could go... what changes at that breakpoint?
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Essentially at the breakpoint, the CAS starts moving in concert with FAS, and so the net difference actually improves, the CAS actually moves greater than FAS after the break point and so the net difference actually declines a little bit after that point. And depending upon how for fast we go by that breakpoint, cash contributions... required cash contributions would increase somewhat. But probably in the couple hundred million dollar range.
Myles Walton - Oppenheimer & Co.: Okay. I think I get that. And then, lastly on cash contributions. What is your tax-deductibility limit for this year? In the past you have obviously... I think you peaked out at about $1 billion in '06, is that kind of tax deductibility limit?
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I don't know what the limit is. I don't know that we are effectively constrained in what we might want to put into the plan. But I don't know if there's a number that constrains us.
Myles Walton - Oppenheimer & Co.: Okay. Okay. Thanks, boring questions, but thanks.
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: All right.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse: Good mornings guys.
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning Robert.
Wes Bush - President and Chief Operating Officer: Good morning.
James F. Palmer - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Good morning.
Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse: Perhaps a follow-on boring question, same topic. Jim, if I understand correctly you just said 20%, 21%. Let's walk through what that means if that number holds for the end of the year. That looks like that's an incremental 400 million?
James F. Palmer - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Essentially, if you file those sensitivities to the outline, that would be about $400 million, if there is no change in the discount rate and if there's no recovery in the investment performance. And as I said we are in a very volatile market, you guys know that. If I look at our investment performance through August, we were at minus... kind of at minus 6%. So the last 45 days have been really, really volatile. And who knows what the... I would be hopeful but I don't know, what could happen to rest of the year.
Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse: Absolutely, okay. Okay. And then sticking with accounting for a moment, could you walk through the royalty line and talk about what happened in electronic systems. And where these reversals occurred, just so we can understand a little bit better?
James F. Palmer - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, if you were to look at the income statement, essentially the royalty receipts our part of segment operating margin. And so the segment operating margin rates or dollars and rate reflects the successful recovery or the settlement of those patent infringement areas. We then reverse it in total margin, and then add it back into other income. So it's... if you were to follow the income statement down, it's in segment, it's out of total and then back into other income.
Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse: Okay. Okay, that's helpful. And then finally Ron or Wes, on tanker termination fee, any update there?
Wes Bush - President and Chief Operating Officer: No, Robert there is none. We are currently awaiting for further instructions from the Air force and also obviously are waiting for the next direction in terms of how the competition will be proceeding. But at this moment we have not received any specific instructions.
Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse: Thank you.
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks Rob.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ronald Epstein of Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.
Ronald Epstein - Merrill Lynch: Yes, good morning guys.
Wes Bush - President and Chief Operating Officer: Good morning.
James F. Palmer - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Good morning.
Wes Bush - President and Chief Operating Officer: How are you?
Ronald Epstein - Merrill Lynch: In your outlook for 2009, Jim, you mentioned that we could see some kind of meaningful upside to the margins in the ship business. What has to happen for that to happen? You kind of... or may the other way to ask is outside of looking in, opinion and what do we need to see, what are milestones, what can give us comfort so that can happen?
James F. Palmer - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Ron, it's simply performing against the contracts as we have today, the EACs and those contracts. Now LHD-8 for example, getting that ship completed is important, knock on wood. There maybe some other opportunities like we had in the third quarter if we get through trials successfully and that on LPDs essentially, the hurricane impact we think we have quantified that and reflected that into our EACs. The opportunity essentially is to do better than what we have assumed in terms of helping our supplier recovery... recover from the impacts of the hurricane. Obviously we have a lot of experience in how to do that. And so we've had a dedicated group of folks helping them with those kinds of issues as well as thinking about what work that maybe it make sense for us to perform, so that we can minimize the total impact of the Hurricane Ike that the supplier experienced.
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: The other thing is that if I could add, this is Ron, keep in mind that only about half of that business in ship building segment is down on the Gulf. The other half is up at Newport [ph] news and part of this plan of course is to continue to perform outstanding on our carriers and our submarines. And that part of the business is going very well.
Ronald Epstein - Merrill Lynch: No I mean could we see an incremental like a 50 or 100 basis points, is that a reasonable thing to try to model?
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: 50 or 100 basis points to what?
Ronald Epstein - Merrill Lynch: Operating margin?
Wes Bush - President and Chief Operating Officer: 2.5%.
James F. Palmer - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: 2.5%, yes.
Ronald Epstein - Merrill Lynch: To go... I mean if you were to add that... I mean if you were to get... could you get towards 9%, I guess, that's what I am driving at?
James F. Palmer - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Let's say, I... as I said we'll give guidance for 2009 in our fourth quarter call. I really don't want to get ahead of that at this point. I think as I said we are going to see a meaningful improvement in ship building margin rates come 2009.
Ronald Epstein - Merrill Lynch: Okay and then I guess just one quick one for Ron. You mentioned how Rogers [ph] weathering sort of the big financial storm. What... from a much broader perspective. Tell me what impact do you think all the government involvement in the capital market will have on defense spending? In terms of just crowding out, I mean the pie is only so big?
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well, this is something we're spending a lot of time thinking about. And I know you are as well. As I said in my initial comments, I would take it from the point of view that the threat spectrum out there is not going to probably get easier and so the nation is going to have those threats. The new President is going to have a whole bunch of issues to deal with, but one of them he can't afford to allow happen is any real or perceived threat or attack on the nation. We are seeing an increasing wiliness on the part of the Congress to allow deficits to rise, that's obviously something a little bit different than we've seen in previous years. We're seeing an increasing momentum to potential tax changes or tax increases, I think no matter who is elected upon looking for some of that I would think after stimulus is done. We really don't know where it's going to be, we know for '09 based upon the appropriated budget, we are solid. We understand where the longer-term contracts, we have multi-year contracts in some cases that are already underway. Clearly the pressures are going to increase in the out years and I really don't know yet how that's going to play. But again I keep coming back to the view that the threat is real and it ain't going away. And I think the key thing for us is to perform on the contracts that we have and make sure the contracts were positioned are, are the ones that are really going to be needed long-term. And that's why we are putting all of our energy. We are very comfortable with our portfolio of where those contracts stand relative to what we think the needs are going to be. And beyond that I think it's anybody's guess.
Ronald Epstein - Merrill Lynch: Right, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned of Sanford Bernstein & Co.
Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein & Co.: Good morning.
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Dough, how are you?
Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein & Co.: Good. I am interested on information and services. Back in February you talked about eventually long term getting into a 9% level margin. And as you look forward and you look at the three units within information and services, how do you see that taking place over time? Where do you expect the growth will be, where do you expect the margin improvements should come from?
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Doug, as I think about that information and services, I think that is an appropriate long-term rate. If I look at the three segments or three pieces, I would have Mission Systems at the highest levels in terms of operating margin rate, the IT business essentially middle, and then the Technical Services business at the lower end below the average for the group in terms of margin rate. In terms of improvement, I think the biggest opportunity is in the information technology piece of the business.
Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein & Co.: But overtime, if you have more growth in Technical Services, I'm just wondering about business next year as you lay out the different margins in those three units, is there more growth obviously in technical services that's going to limit your margin upside?
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, I don't think so. I think we are going to have proportionally our percentage wise a greater growth or have the opportunity to have greater growth in technical services. But it is still a small piece of the total and so it doesn't drive the margin... or the overall margin rate that greatly. So again, when I look at both Mission Systems and IT, I see the potential for equal to or greater growth rate in terms of revenue in those two pieces as I do in technical services. So, I think the contribution, the relative contribution waiting will continue to be about what it is today.
Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein & Co.: Okay, then on... then within there, Wes commented earlier that you are seeing the size of the state and local backlog go down in IT, but you did... you just did two small contracts in State of Oklahoma and State of Texas, are you thinking differently now about how you pursue those state and local contracts?
Wes Bush - President and Chief Operating Officer: Yes Doug, it is Wes. We are being very selective, we are looking at a variety of both financial criteria associated with the bid as well as I'm better understanding I think the customer expectations and their ability to contract in a way that makes sense for us. So, we have introduced a number of parameters that we're assessing in the state and local environment.
Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein & Co.: So, you haven't ruled them out now; you're just looking at them differently?
Wes Bush - President and Chief Operating Officer: Yes, no, we have not ruled them out. There are some meaningful opportunities there, but we are being I would say substantially more selective today than we were even a year and a half ago.
James F. Palmer - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes Doug we have actually passed on a couple of fairly substantial opportunities that under a previous circumstance we might have well thought we couldn't resist. I would basically note them.
Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein & Co.: Okay. Okay, great. Well thank you.
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss of UBS. Please proceed.
David Strauss - UBS: Good morning, thank you.
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning David.
David Strauss - UBS: Your pension asset allocation you made the comment that it has shift away from equities. I think we had you at close to 50% based on your 10-K and the move to down 21% or 22% during October which seem to indicate still a pretty heavy weighting towards equities, do you have an updated allocation that you can provide?
James F. Palmer - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes. In terms of benchmark or policy, we at the end of last year had a 55% waiting to equities. The new benchmark is 35% and at the end of September we were little bit over 25% in equities.
David Strauss - UBS: Okay. And what about the fixed income versus other?
James F. Palmer - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Essentially the move in the benchmark or the policy from 55 to 35, we took 10 percentage points and added it to alternatives, and 10 percentage points and added it to fixed income. So from a policy perspective; today it's 35% equities divided between domestic and international, 25% in alternatives, and 40% in fixed income.
David Strauss - UBS: Okay. Ron, could you spend a second and maybe talk about how Northrop is looking at the smaller satellite opportunity, what I guess is referred to is ORS and what exactly the company is doing in that area?
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well, obviously this is something, we have continued to track in. We have not been a major supplier of small satellites over the years, David. Revenues have not been the same as they've been for some of our larger satellites. We do look at some of these satellites; we do look at ways that we can take off the shelf payloads, put them together, we have a couple of things where we're thinking about now. I don't think we are in a position to project any significant targets or awards in that area at the moment. But it is something we will see continuing. There has been in my experience in this satellite business and it expands four decades, I am sorry to say, has always been a almost a dichotomy of view between large efficient satellites and small cheaper, faster, better satellites that goes back and forth in cycles. And it usually goes with what the most recent area of short coming was. Today we are seeing some significant concerns about large satellite programs, I think the Doug [ph] Group in the Pentagon are deciding not to proceed at the moment with TSAT. Part of that issue has to do with the submission requirements, part of that has to do with the concern about how large it is. On the other hand, in other venues, in military and intelligence world, you do see large satellite programs. So, I think we are going to see a mix over time. I think the proponents of revenues are still going to be with the larger satellite programs. And those are the franchise programs.
David Strauss - UBS: That's great. And one last from me for Wes, the Green Labor situation, there was so much of a problem on LHD 8, can you kind of address where you are there?
Wes Bush - President and Chief Operating Officer: Yes, it continues to improve. We've instituted a number of activities in the Gulf to address training, there's been a long lot of the application of less on LHD 8 to the other activities we have under way in the Gulf. We continue to look for experienced new hires but I would say overall our labor situation in the Gulf has stabilized. And we feel very good about the quality of the capability of labor force there.
David Strauss - UBS: Great. Thanks guys.
Wes Bush - President and Chief Operating Officer: Thank you, David.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Heidi Wood of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley: Good morning, nice quarter guys.
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you Heidi.
Wes Bush - President and Chief Operating Officer: Thanks Heidi.
Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley: Ron, I wanted to just ask you a little about the outlook in 2009. Both candidates have been talking about it looks likes in the next administration, both sides are going to take a focus on cost growth within defense program, can you give us a sense about what steps you're taking to mitigate cost growth ahead of time so that when they turn to you and doing end up review, you come out strong?
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: That's an important question and it's a broad one. Obviously for as long as I have been in the business and I think everyone else procurement reform, cost growth have been the fundamental issues. It's just been the nature of the business of buying large weapon systems. I think both candidates are going to take a fresh look at it. A lot will depend up on who they put in place in their national security teams and their defense teams. We do believe that there might be some initial pressure towards changing contracting types. But the thing with changing contracting types is that that's on a go forward basis. I think what we would have to do Heidi is be prepared to bid the programs appropriately for the contract type that's required. So, for example there is more pressure on fixed priced contracting. I think speaking for Northrop we're going to be much more careful in terms how we would approach that. From risk management standpoint, I would dare to say most of the other companies would be as well. We've all been through the cycle about 15-20 years ago, where there was enormous pressure to do that, and that did not work out well either for the industry or frankly for the Pentagon because a lot of programs got cancelled. One of the things we are doing internally and one of the things that Wes is focusing on very, very intensely is the execution of the programs we have, making sure that we're driving on technical performance, scheduled performance, and working to achieve the potential of the margins that are available to us on those programs as we negotiate the contracts. And then going forward of course as we mentioned here a couple of times in the call, we are taking out a much more careful look at the structure of the contracts going forward. That contracts can beat good people nine times out of ten, we want good contracts.
Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley: Great, thanks. That's very helpful. And secondly as a follow-up, can you flesh out a little bit, how does 2009 sales look if we do see a material step down in new program awards just again because of this budget tightening and we're already seeing with ARH and TSAT and others.
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well Heidi first of all, the way our business works as you know with our record backlog, that really does define a good portioning and an enormous portion of the estimated sales revenues for next year. Secondly, majority of that is actually funded as a result of the Defense Appropriation Bill for 2009. And so... and as Jim had indicated in his... at the end of his remarks, we do see growth in 2009 and we'll quantify that obviously in the fourth quarter call. So at this point in time, if I take a look at our portfolio of programs, there are always potential programs that could be cancelled midyear. We don't see a lot of at the moment. And frankly, the programs that were involved were pretty well fully funded as part of the '09 budget.
Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley: I do know that Ron which is why I was hoping you might give us a percentage so that we could again, know that how much of your revenues are ahead or ultra rock solid, if they stay kind of 80% to 90%?
James F. Palmer - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: HeidiI'd say that's about right. Maybe as much as 90%. The rock solid, you hate to say that word because you never know what will happen. But historically, very, very solid funded backlog, funded programs are budgeted for the fiscal year. And I'd say certainly in high 80s perhaps, as much as 90%.
Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley: Great, thanks very much.
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Heidi.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr of Cowen & Company. Please proceed.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company: Thank you. Good quarter.
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company: Could we return to shipbuilding. You mentioned $27 million of kind of charges for Ike and Gustav, $34 million plus, and the $36 million risks adjusted, is the 27 included in the 36 or are those separate. So is the net impact $29 million negative?
James F. Palmer - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: The net impact is the 29 number.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company: Okay. And then, if it is the 29 number, if we add it back, and I understand it's not totally right, because some of the risk mitigation reflected on a period. I would imply a margin in shipbuilding of about 10%. Was there anything else positive in there to get us to that kind of a number, or was a lot of this risk mitigation applicable to the current period revenues?
James F. Palmer - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well, you did pretty good math Cai. And yes, if you make those kind of adjustments you will get through that kind of number. There obviously were some strong performance in other programs as well, none of which I would characterize as unusual or exceedingly large, if they would... if they were we would have talked about it. So there were some programs in shipbuilding that had good strong performance in the quarter. And it goes with the comments that Ron and Wes have made about our attention to shipbuilding and the focus we all have is on how do we improve the Gulf Coast but there is parts of the shipbuilding enterprise that is doing very, very well.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company: Thanks. And then if we could kind of return to pension, you kind of mentioned that it's basically $4 million for each one point in performance.
James F. Palmer - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: No, let me. Make sure we get the numbers right. For every 100 basis points change in the investment return, pension expense would increase or decrease by $40 million.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company: I guess the question is, is that linear or if in fact your $20 million to $21 million under water, do you basically go outside of the quarter so that number begins to escalate?
James F. Palmer - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: No, not true. For financial accounting for FAS, it is essentially linear after our 10% negative... 10% assumption. So the FAS number is essentially linear, that 100 basis points is $40 million after the breakpoint, then CAS starts moving in concert, actually moving greater than FAS, and so the net difference above the break point starts coming down.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company: Okay, that very helpful. And then assuming you are in fact 20% to 21% underwater which is... begins to looks... look like will be there or greater, what are your initial thoughts about how much you might contribute to the pension plan in the fourth quarter or next year? How do you --
James F. Palmer - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: We... I am sorry, go ahead.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company: How do you plan... how do you think about... how do you approach that problem?
James F. Palmer - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well we start with the cash... the strong cash flow of the company, and we think about where the actual returns may come out, and where the discount rate may come out, all of which will be factors or considerations as we think about how much we may want to put in from a voluntary perspective into the plan here in the fourth quarter or maybe even early in 2009.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company: Okay. And the last one on pension, you mentioned year-over-year swing of $415 million from I guess $165 million plus to $250 million minus and yet if FAS goes to... goes... if that would imply that FAS goes to $665 million implying that CAS has to go down to around $415 million to 450, is that in fact what you're actually saying if you close --
James F. Palmer - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I think you just may have the numbers backwards. Today, 2008, we have a essentially net FAS, CAS income of $250 million.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company: Correct.
James F. Palmer - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: At 10%... minus 10% and 7%, it goes to an expense of about $165 million, that's the $415 million, the net change.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company: Okay. And then --
James F. Palmer - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: And that $415 million is essentially FAS going up by $465 million and CAS going up by $50 million to get to get to that $415 million net.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company: Got it. I got it. Thank you.
James F. Palmer - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I guess the other think we think you all recognize, but I just feel like I have to mention it. As you know we use the actual market value of our planned assets at the end of the year for determining our pension expense for next year. Others have a smooth effect. Economically the results were exactly the same. It's only the timing of when you recognize those economic results. We are recognizing them currently; others are deferring them into future years. My estimate is that if we were using a method similar to others that $415 million change year-over-year about 75% of it would have been deferred.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company: Thanks a lot. Thank you very much.
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks Cai.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Carter Copland of Barclays Capital. Please proceed.
James F. Palmer - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hey Carter, how are you doing?
Carter Copland - Barclays Capital: I'm good guys. Actually all of my questions have been answered. Thanks, good quarter.
James F. Palmer - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: All right, thank you. I like those calls.
Wes Bush - President and Chief Operating Officer: Thank you.
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Mr. Gaston Kent for closing remarks.
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Okay, this is Ron. This closes the call and I want to thank everybody for attending strong quarter. We really appreciate your continued interest and we look forward to talking to you at the end of the fourth quarter call.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation, you may now disconnect. Good day. .

===== 2008 Q2  (2008-07-31 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Great day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Northrop Grumman's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. My name is Katrina. And, I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of this presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I will now like to turn the presentation over to our host for today's call, Mr. Gaston Kent, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, please proceed.
Gaston Kent: Thanks Katrina, and good morning everyone. Welcome to Northrop Grumman's second quarter 2008 conference call. We've provided supplemental information in the form of a PowerPoint that you can access on our Investor Relations website at northropgrumman.com. The presentation will be available for a limited time and should be viewed in conjunction with today's commentary. Before we start, please understand that as shown on slide two, some of the matters discussed on this call constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements reflect the company's views with respect to future events and perspective financial performance. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties and the actual results of the company may differ materially from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. A more complete expression of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the company's SEC filings, including Forms 10-K and the 10-Q which was filed this morning. We're also filing a shelf registration statement with the SEC that replaces the company's existing shelf registration, which would have expired later this year. During the call, we'll discuss second quarter results, including the non-GAAP measures, segment operating income, and operating margin and free cash flow. Both of which are reconciled in our press release. During today's call, we will also discuss the outlook for the remainder of 2008. Guidance will include GAAP measures of sales, operating margin rate, earnings per share from continuing operations, cash from operations and non-GAAP measure, segment operating margin rate and free cash flow. We also want to draw to your attention to schedule six of our earnings release. This schedule provides 2006 and 2007 reported and realigned results that reflect the transfer of certain missile systems programs by Mission Systems to Space Technology. On the call today are our Chairman and CEO, Ron Sugar; our President and COO, Wes Bush; and Chief Financial Officer, Jim Palmer. We would now turn to slide three. At this time I would like to turn the call over to Ron.
Ron Sugar: Thank you, Gaston, and hello everyone. Thanks for joining us. We're pleased with second quarter results, particularly, with the nearly double-digit sales growth we posted this quarter. All four of our businesses generated higher sales led by ship building and aerospace. Fully diluted earnings per share increased 10% and EPS from continuing operations increased by 4% with the difference being the gain on the sale of our Electro-Optical Systems business that's reflected in discontinued operations. Both of these increases come on top of last year's $0.05 per share tax benefit. Second quarter operating income and margin rates are healthy, and at mid-year point, we are on track to meet our 2008 guidance. Cash from operations and free cash flow are improving as we move through the year and are on track to achieve the guidance. As you know, our cash generation typically increases as we move through the year. And we expect cash to be very strong in the third and fourth quarters. We continue to execute our balanced cash deployment strategy during the quarter, repurchasing approximately 2.8 million shares of our stock. Year-to-date, we have repurchased 10.3 million shares for approximately $800 million. There is $1.7 billion remaining on our current repurchased authorization. We ended the quarter with the total backlog of nearly $67 billion. New business awards in the quarter, totaled $7.5 billion and include new competitive awards as well as follow-on to some of our franchise programs. This brings year-to-date new business awards to approximately $20 billion. We won the navy's $1.2 billion Broad Area Maritime Surveillance or BAMS' contract in the second quarter; another strategic victory for Northrop Grumman. As with our tanker win, one of the losing bidders has protested the award. We expect the GAO decision on BAMS protest by mid-August. Other important wins during the quarter include a significant position on JTRS that is the Joint Tactical Radio System, AMF, Starlight and U.S. Army contract to produce the new multifunction radar for its ERMP Unmanned Aerial Vehicle program as well as several important restricted awards. And just last week, our technical services sector won two important awards. First, is participation in the contract field teams program, a seven year indefinite quantity, indefinite delivery air force contract with a potential collective value of $10 billion. Second, is participation on the air force's Flexible Acquisition and Sustainment Tool were fast program also on IDIQ contract that has a collective sealing value of $6.9 billion over 10 years. Another notable event in the quarter was the delivery of the first National Security Cutter, the Bertholf to the United States coastguard. This is the most technologically advanced ship in the U.S. coastguard history, and an important new weapon to safeguard the security of our homeland. Looking ahead, you are all aware that the Department of Defense will reopen the bidding for the aerial refueling tanker. The government has said the re-bid will be limited to a small number of procedural items identified by the GAO. And announcing the Pentagon's decision, Secretary Gates reconfirmed that our forces need the best tanker at the best value. Our KC-45 is the most capable of giving the air force what it needs, better fuel efficiency, greater fuel offload, and much lower risk. That's why this tanker has won last five global competitions against the 767. The KC-45 tanker is built, tested and flying. It's refueling system has completed more than 100 hours of in-flight testing. New tankers are urgently needed now and our KC-45 is ready to go now. The air-force selected the right tanker in February, and we are confident that Department of Defense will do so again. The tanker is not the only significant new opportunity in our pipeline. We are also competing for the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle, Aerial Common Sensor, the Transformational Satellite Program TSAT, the GPS Next Generation Ground Control segment, The Vehicular Intercommunication Systems next generation and other substantial opportunities. I'd like to comment for a moment on the navy's recently reported plan to build just two DDG 1000 destroyers and then return to production of more DDG 51s. This potential changed the navy's ship building program will undergo review by the Secretary Defense as well as by both houses of Congress. As a partner with our customer, we will continue to provide the navy with our inputs into how such plans impact the shipbuilding industrial base, realizing that this is one of many important factors included in their decision making process. We are currently building one DDG 1000 and four DDG 51s at our Pascagoula shipyard. We will support United States Navy in the execution of the shipbuilding plan they identify as best addressing the needs of our nation. In summary, the quarter was solid. It was another quarter in which we grew sales, generated solid returns, captured important competitive opportunities and maintained an outstanding backlog. And for 2008, we are on a pace to achieve $33 billion in sales, $4.90 to $5.15 in earnings per share; cash from operations of $2.6 billion to $2.9 billion and free cash flow of $1.7 billion to $2.1 billion. All of which support our confidence in the outlook for Northrop Grumman in 2008 and beyond. While today's call is focused on financial performance, I would like to take a moment to reflect on the recent dramatic rescue of our three co-workers Marc Gonsalves, Thomas Howes and Keith Stansel who had been held hostage for more than five years in Columbia by the FARC guerrilla forces. I cannot overstate the joy we all feel to see them return to their families and homeland. I want to extend our heartfelt appreciation to the many, many women of the Columbian and the United States Governments who worked so hard for so many years to re-unite Tom, Marc and Keith with their families. And while we celebrate their return, we are mindful that a fourth employee, Tom Janis was killed by the FARC shortly after the plane crashed in the Colombian jungle in 2003. He is deeply missed and will not be forgotten. Now, at this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Wes Bush. Wes?
Wes Bush: Thanks Ron. Hello everyone. My comments are outlined on slide 4, and will include updates on several programs. I'll begin with Wedgetail. As most of you know the prime contractor announced a delivery delay and took a substantial charge on the program this quarter. As result of these delays, during the quarter we took an additional $20 million provision for the Wedgetail program, which contemplates the risk associated with this announced delay. Our main survey for Wedgetail continues to make good progress toward completion. We continue to improve the radar system stability performance, and based on the prime contractor's revised schedule, we expect to enter the type acceptance test and evaluation phase this quarter, with ground test beginning in August and flight test starting in September. We also continue to support the prime contractor in the integration of the radar with the mission computing systems and radar performance continues to improve as the flight test program matures. Regarding the F-16 Block 60 program, development acceptance testing has been completed for the Agile Beam Radar and the targeting system. And we're on track to complete the next round of testing in the third quarter. Final in-country development acceptance testing of these modules is scheduled for early in the fourth quarter of this year. The Falcon Edge software for Block 60 continues to achieve intermediate delivery milestones toward its scheduled delivery in the second half of 2008. The third and final incremental software has progressed from development to integration, and will be delivered this quarter for flight testing and ultimate delivery to the customer for in-country flight testing and deployment. There will be one subsequent software update, completing the electronic warfare capability. We continue to perform within our current EAC. Moving onto our state and local programs, we're pleased with our progress and performance on both of Virginia Outsourcing and New York City Wireless programs. On Virginia Outsourcing, we completed key milestones needed to transition the services delivery. The cutover to services delivery occurred on July 1st as scheduled. Ongoing infrastructure consolidation will continue into the middle of 2009 as scheduled under the contract. The New York City Wireless program achieved initial operating capability on March 31s. We're continuing to build out the network, and we anticipate full network capability later this year. As this impressive capability nears completion, we expect to be adding new services in the future, further enhancing the utility of the network for the city. On our county of San Diego program, we completed the transition phase last year, and we're now in the recurring services phase. A recently completed program assessment generated a reduced revenue projection for the remaining life of the program. And as a result, we've adjusted the value of the deferred costs to reflect this revised outlook, which negatively impacted second quarter performance. Looking at our IT business model more broadly, we continued to grow and perform across the breadth of the marketplace. We see substantial new opportunities for growth in all of our IT business areas. Our information technology leadership team is taking significant actions, aimed at improving operating and financial performance across the sector, including organizational changes, focused on reducing costs and improving organizational effectiveness. One of these key actions has been to establish more strength in financial criteria for our business model in the IT outsourcing space. I'll conclude my comments with the LHD-8 progress report as measured against the key milestones that we've established last quarter. The first milestone was the aft main engine light off scheduled for the second quarter. We successfully completed this milestone on schedule. The next major milestone scheduled for the third quarter is completion of electrical cabling. We've made significant progress in this area. We have confidence that we'll meet this cabling milestone in the third quarter. And I would add that timely accomplishment of this milestone is critical to our ability to support the test program on the delivery timeline that we've established. We are meeting our schedules and we are on track to complete the remaining milestones, leaving us the delivery of LHD-8 in the second quarter of 2009. Mike Petters and his shipbuilding team are making tremendous progress on the program, and Jim and I are personally reviewing LHD-8 progress on a weekly basis. Now, my comments this quarter have again focused on a few challenging programs among the 20,000 of our portfolio that are demonstrating outstanding performance. As today's results indicate, we are generating solid results across the company. Program execution is the fundamental driver of our performance. And the improvements that we continue to demonstrate and performing on our current contracts, managing risks and capturing new business that generates value for our shareholders, will enable us to meet our financial objectives. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jim to discuss the financials.
James F. Palmer: Thanks, Wes. Good morning ladies and gentlemen. As both Wes and Ron indicated, we are on-track to achieve our 2008 guidance. And overall we're satisfied with the second quarter performance. Growth for our EPS from continuing operations for the quarter was 7.5% after adjusting for last year's $16 million or $0.05 per share tax benefit. We had strong organic sales growth, while at the same time maintaining the very robust backlog. And cash flow showed a marked improvement from the first quarter. Although year-to-date cash flow is lower than last year, we have always expected a very strong second half for cash generation, as I said on last quarter's call. Beginning with sales on slide 5, all four of the businesses were up over last year. The trends for Information and Services, Aerospace and Electronics are consistent with the first quarter and demonstrate continued strength in product areas like intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance for the information and services and programs like UCAS-D, EA-6B, Global Hawk, several key restricted and several space projects for Aerospace. The 24% increase in shipbuilding is in directly comparable to last year and that it includes more than $150 million attributable to three events. First, is the impact of the last year's Gulf Coast labor strike. The second is the step down in sales, resulting from the LHA... LHD, EAC adjustment last year. And then the addition of AMSAC, which occurred in third quarter of last year. Adjusting for these three items, sales growth was more in the order of 13% in shipbuilding. This organic growth reflects a wrap-up in activity for LPDs, DDGs, and aircraft carriers. Excluding these shipbuilding items on a consolidated basis, the company had high single-digit solid sales growth. Now, moving to slide 6, on a consolidated basis, segment operative margin declined by $14 million, and as a percent of sales decline to 100 basis points to 9.1% from 10.1%. The majority of the decline in margin rate is attributable to three factors. First, is the decline at shipbuilding due to the step down in booking rates on the Gulf Coast shipbuilding programs that were impacted by the resource constraints caused by the previously announced LHD-8 delay. Second is the Wedgetail charge and third is the adjustment to San Diego IT outsourcing contract. Now, I'll walk through each of the four businesses to give a little bit more color. Beginning with the Information and Services, Mission Systems had a outstanding strong 11% margin than last year's second quarter. The change to this year's operating rate reflects a more normal level of contract adjustments than occurred in the prior year. That is the primary driver of the change in operating income and in rate compared to the prior year period. Information technology was negatively impacted by the reduction in the value of the deferred costs for the County of San Diego IT Outsourcing program. This essentially accounts for the 100 basis points of decline in information technology's margin rate. Without this charge, performance would have been comparable to last year's 7.9% margin rate. And as Wes mentioned, we are very focused on improving financial performance at information technology. This quarter's margin rate is not what we expect from this business. We are keenly focused on improving performance through better execution on existing contracts while being more selective as we pursue new opportunities. The business model used for outsourcing opportunities has been tightened to focus on return on assets as well as return on sales. Moving to Aerospace, this quarter's 9.5% margin rate versus 10.4% last year is inline with our expectations for this business and it supports our guidance. The primary driver of the change is the $27 million favorable adjustment we recognized last year for the settlement of prior year's overhead claims in this business. Adjusting for that item, we would have had margin expansion in Aerospace. Electronics posted a very strong second quarter performance driven by sales growth as well as margin improvement. Electronics operating income rose 7% and margin rate expanded by 50 basis points. At shipbuilding, the decline in margin rate to 7.5% from 9.9% last year, reflects the announced step back in booking rates on several programs. Likewise, last year's second quarter included some favorable adjustments that drove shipbuilding's margin rate up to the 9.9%. Below the segment line, operating income increased by 6% generally inline with the organic sales growth, and margin rate was 9.3% compared to 9.7% in the second quarter of 2007. We had an improvement of $21 million in corporate unallocated expense, and a $41 million improvement in net pension adjustment. This quarter's corporate unallocated run rate was higher than the first quarter, primarily due to higher unallowable expenses in the quarter. The other notable item on the P&L is the $14 million increase and other net, primarily driven by gains from sales of assets this quarter versus some losses recorded on sales last year. These improvements were partially offset by an increase in our effective tax rate to 34.6% this quarter, compared to 29.7% in the prior year quarter. This year's higher effective tax rate compared to last year's, negatively affected the comparison of year-over-year earnings per share by about $0.11. Moving onto cash on slide 7, cash from operations was $607 million for the quarter, down from $741 million last year. However, last year's cash from operations included a $125 million insurance recovery which we didn't have this year. And, as we have previously discussed, we do expect our cash flow this year to be more backend loaded. We don't expect the timing of cash flow to impact our cash deployment strategy however. This leads me to 2008 guidance for the business, which is summarized on slide 8. Our sales guidance for each of the four businesses as unchanged other than to reflect the transfer of approximately $1 billion of Missile Systems business to Aerospace from Information and Services. So, our sales expectation for Information and Services is now $12 billion to $12.5 billion, compared with a prior range of $13 billion to $13.5 billion. And in likewise the sales and expectation for Aerospace has now increased by $1 billion to $9.3 billion to $9.5 billion, compared to the prior guidance of $8.3 billion to $8.5 billion. The change in these estimates have no impact on our consolidated sales guidance, which remains approximately $33 billion. Moving onto slide 9, our margin rates expectations for the four businesses are also unchanged. We continue to expect consolidated segment operating margin rate in the high... to mid to high 8% range which comprises a low 8% range for information and services; about 10% for Aerospace, mid 12% for Electronics; and about 3% for Shipbuilding, all of which are unchanged from the guidance we provided on the first quarter call. Looking at where we are year-to-date, we will have higher consolidated segment margin rate in the second-half of the year. The year-to-date consolidated 7.6% segment margin rate is primarily driven by the first quarter charge at shipbuilding. Through the first quarters, we are on track for Information and Services, Aerospace and Electronics in order to reach the mid-to-high 8% range for the year, Shipbuilding margin rate will expand as we go through the second half of the year, which is what we have been expecting. We continue to expect total margin operating rate in the high 8% range with a tax rate of approximately 34%. Now moving to slide 10, summarizes our guidance for 2008. Our year-to-date results and our outlook for the remainder of the year support our guidance for sales, segment and total operating margin rates. And earnings per share from continuing operations are 490 to 515 per share. Looking at cash, we continued to expect $2.6 billion to $2.9 billion of cash from operations, and free cash flow of $1.7 billion to $2.1 billion. Now, Gaston I think with that we are ready to turn it back it over to you for questions-and-answers.
Gaston Kent: Thanks, Jim. Katrina, we're ready for Q&A. Question And Answer
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Myles Walton, representing Oppenheimer & Co. Please proceed.
Myles Walton: Thanks. Good morning.
Ron Sugar: Good morning, Myles.
Wes Bush: Good morning, Myles.
Myles Walton: Ron, I was wondering if you could give us just little bit more color on the DDG 1000 and kind of what it means to Northrop currently in terms of P&L impact? And also just from a standpoint of overall structure of the shipyard, this kind of... would it be number one, a major disruption to switch back to the 51s and overall for your business? Would you see this as a positive, negative, neutral or a negative that you can work through pretty quickly?
Ron Sugar: Well, Myles, obviously this is still work-in-process and the time comes to associate with a decision like this is long and the impact is that it works at least for the shipyard is much, much longer. The first order, we are not concerned one with the other will, we think it's probably about neutral because what we believe will happen is that overtime as if this in fact is a decision and there is no guarantee it will be by the way, because as I said in my comments, the Congress are weighing on this. But if it is a decision then, there'll be some lead time associated with getting the DDG 51 line extended. And also there is a whole lot of work ahead of us on the DDG 1000. And as you know, we are doing work both for ourselves and in support of our partner at Bath [ph]. We are going to support the Navy whichever way they go, obviously the industrial base considerations have to factor into it. We're not going to be bashful about our concerns. But at this point in time this doesn't keep me up at night.
Myles Walton: Okay. And Integrated Systems had really nice sales growth in the quarter, even in spite of some JSF ramp-down I guess in the R&D before you ramp back up into production. When exactly is the inflexion point for the F-35 that it would go back towards growth for you? Is it 2009?
Ron Sugar: Basically 2009. Yes.
Myles Walton: Okay. And then maybe lastly and then I'll get out of way, in terms of the charge that was taken on Wedgetail less, was that charges just for the delay of your effort in keeping the work force moving or was it anticipated that there was a portion of liquidated damages that will be assessed?
Ron Sugar: Myles, when we look at taking a charge like that, we look at all other factors. Clearly, we look at the risk and delay as well as our liabilities associated... potential liabilities associated with things like liquidated damages. So, it was a composite view. Jim do you want to?
James F. Palmer: We looked at all the risk and consider all the risks.
Myles Walton: Okay.
James F. Palmer: In the charges taken.
Myles Walton: Okay. I didn't get a chance to read the queue but what it say $40 million is still a number.
James F. Palmer: Actually, we think the number is a little bit less. And at this point with...
Myles Walton: Okay. Thank you.
Gaston Kent: Thank you, Myles.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of the Ronald Epstein, representing Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.
Ronald Epstein: Yes, good morning guys.
Ron Sugar: Good morning.
James F. Palmer: Good morning, Ron.
Ronald Epstein: When weget back and look at quarter, I think most of the business units year-over-year margins are actually down. And I guess from a broader prospective, the investment community has been pretty patient, kind of waiting for things to turn. When would you expect to see that to really be reflected in the financials. Margins start going off kind of across the business units?
Ron Sugar: Yes, Ron. If you look at the absolute numbers, you are right. Margin rates are down. There are explanations obviously for those changes. For example the $27 million, onetime overhead settlement prior overhead settlement and IS. So, I can agree with you the margin rates on a absolute number are down. There are reasons for it. This is a long cycle business. I do think we're really focused on execution. We're making the right decisions. Those improvements will show up overtime. And management is really committed to driving the long-term opportunities in this business.
Ronald Epstein: True. I mean I guess another way to phrase it. When would you expect the special stuff to just get washed out, and we start to see the execution in the business unit signed through? I mean it need to be born across the large cap defense sector, I mean many of your competitors in large cap defense group had outstanding quarters with excellent operating executions. You guys kind of stand out a little bit because margins I guess to seem a drag little. In my senses investors maybe getting impatient. So, I mean, you guessed, how do I phrase when we start to see that really showing through?
James F. Palmer: Yes Ron. Frankly, I think we have a different mix of business than many of competitors. We are I believe in much more of a development transitioning to production phase, they have much more of a production phase mentality. Production programs are very healthy historically for the industry does very well. And so, I feel real good about our position today and what it means for our future. We do have a few of these problems if you will from the past. We are dealing with those. But that doesn't diminish my view of what the opportunity is for this company.
Ronald Epstein: Okay, great. And then just one more question for Ron, if I may. To follow-up on Myles question about DDG 51. If that 1000 were to go away, what do you think it means for CDX and where there pursue the same hope?
Ron Sugar: I think there's a lot of debate going on right now Ron on what the CDX should be. I think it's a general consensus that it has to have an air defense or missile defense mission. There are different views whether that should be the same tumble home whole form. Whether it should be a different one. Others, even a new dimension which has been added, should it be a nuclear based ship or a non-nuclear based ship. And that's going to be a trade study that's going to go on for the next couple of years I think as navy sorts all that out. And obviously we are participant in that in terms of providing our best suggestions. But the navy is really going to have to sort all that out. So, I don't know the answer. I do think that there is a strong compelling view both in the navy and in the Congress that there must be continuity of production in shipyards involved i.e. of Pascagoula and Bath. And I think there is a strong understanding that there was a national resources and if we decide to stop after total of two DDG 1000s, DDG 51s are going to have to come in and fill the gap. And the navy, by the way, does need ships. So, we will watch the same place play self out. We are not lighting our hair on fire. We are just proceeding.
Ronald Epstein: Great. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of George Shapiro representing Citi. Please proceed.
George Shapiro: Hi. Good morning
Ron Sugar: Good morning, George.
James F. Palmer: Good morning, George.
George Shapiro: Jim, in the cash flow you had mentioned in the first quarter that you expected the receivables to come down in the second quarter. Certainly the $200 million you attributed to the SAP and yet receivables didn't come down which looks to me like part of the reason for the weak cash flows. So what happened that it didn't come down and why do you obviously think it's going to happen in the second half of the year?
Ron Sugar: Yes. It didn't make quite as much as progress as we had anticipated. We did make progress. You know this business well, George, cash is very lumpy. And as I look forward, I feel good about the second half forecast, basically because compared July results to July last year, actual cash receipts generally inline with what we experienced last year, historically the industry does well in the third quarter simply because of the end of the government fiscal year. We do well in the fourth quarter because we are shut down for 10 days to two weeks around the Christmas holidays. So we have less cost input and essentially a lot of cash collections occurring during that time period. So, everything I see tells me that our expectations for strong second half cash flow is reasonable. It is based on our experience. As I said July cash receipts are generally inline with cash receipts last year. So all the indicators are good. Yes, we didn't make quite as much progress as we had hoped on getting all those SAP receivables collected. But again that's an opportunity for the second half. So, I feel good about where we're going to go.
George Shapiro: Okay. Because I mean obviously you got to need a pretty big number for this second half of the year to get even get even to low end of your guidance?
James F. Palmer: Yes. Not only do I recognize it that everyone in the company recognizes it and incentivise to go, get it done.
George Shapiro: Okay. And then in Electronics, once again we had relatively slow growth. It looks to me like this its stretch here to get to your $7 billion and $7.2 billion guidance for the year. I mean what happens in Q3 and Q4 to really get a step up in the growth rate?
James F. Palmer: The Electronics business, George, is part of our business that uses units of delivery more than anyone else to recognize percent of completion. And historically that Electronics business has high fourth quarter units of delivery, essentially tied to the budgeting processes of our customers. And so again what we see in terms of our expectations based on the contracts we have is that we will have high fourth quarter units of delivery in the Electronics business that will help, if you will bridge the gap or the growth in revenues to the fourth quarter.
Ron Sugar: Yes. Let me add one thing as well, George, to this question. If you look at the year-over-year growth and backlog in Electronics, it's up substantially. It's up over $1 billion dollars year-over-year. So we are continuing to see the growth in the backlog and that will then... you will start seeing that come through in our top line. It takes a little while to transition backlog into the top line. But this is a business that's growing and we are pleased with how it's doing.
George Shapiro: Okay. And then just one last one Jim. You had mentioned in response to couple of questions after the first quarter, that the margin in ships would probably be somewhere around 8.5% in Q2 to Q4. And this quarter was obviously 7.5%. So was there some other down ticking in the margin accruals on other programs in this quarter or what cause this quarter to be less than what the thinking was before?
James F. Palmer: George, if I can go back and check the script, my recollection is that, I said that it would be at least be... it needed to be 8.5% for the balance of the year to get the 3%. And that we expected to trend upward as we went through the year. There is always in terms of this quarter, there is always little nits and naps if you will around contract adjustments. So we did have some of that. But, again I feel good about the margin rate for the Shipbuilding business of about 3% for the year.
George Shapiro: So were the contract adjustments this quarter effectively further lowering the margin accruals on the other programs or they were just more onetime kinds of items?
James F. Palmer: I would consider them onetime type items.
George Shapiro: Okay. Thanks so much.
James F. Palmer: Yes. George, ups and downs frankly.
George Shapiro: Okay. Okay thanks.
Ron Sugar: Katrina?
Operator: The next question comes from a line of Doug Harned representing Stanford Bernstein. Please Proceed.
Doug Harned: Good morning.
Ron Sugar: Good morning.
James F. Palmer: Good morning.
Doug Harned: I just wanted to follow-on that last question with... in your earnings release, you said that in shipbuilding that's lower operating income reflected additional cost for schedule impact for several shipbuilding programs as a result of resource constraints. Are those issue sort of in addition to what you saw when you took the $320 million charge? Is there something more going on with those other shipbuilding programs than you perhaps expected last quarter?
James F. Palmer: Generally consistent with what we expected last quarter. As I said we always have in every business, in every quarter contract adjustments up and down. We had some of those in the shipbuilding businesses this quarter as well. But again as I said in terms of my view of the about 3% margin for the year, I think we're okay.
Doug Harned: No. I'm just trying to understand how things are proceeding in the Gulf because my impression...
James F. Palmer: I think, as Wes said, our focus clearly has been on LHD-8 weekly reviews with Mike and the team. Team is making really good progress.
Wes Bush: But I would add that one of the important actions that we've been taking is to make sure that we're balancing the application resource across all of the programs there. We continue to work closely with the navy to make sure that the priority are aligned with their needs. As we do that dynamic balancing, we on a continuous basis shift the applications of those resources. So I think that's working well. And your broader questions about how are things going in the Gulf, I give that team a lot of credit for the progress that they make. I think we are on the right track and consistent with the guidance we've given for the performance that we expect out of the Gulf this year.
Doug Harned: Okay. And then on Information Technology, you described the issues in San Diego County on cost is being what led to some lower margin levels than you might have expected. Could you describe how that program is going right now and how confident you are that you have basically made the adjustments you need to make and we won't see something like this happen further down the road?
James F. Palmer: Yes Doug. As Wes said in his comments, we looked at the revenue projections for the five years of the contract and essentially lowered those slightly, which essentially resulted in the reduction in the deferred cost associated with the program. The program itself from a operating prospective is doing just fine.
Doug Harned: Are you through with the transition period where you feel you have pretty much established your cost base and you know what that will return?
James F. Palmer: We are through the transition period, maybe I need to be clear here or more blunt. You need to estimate your revenues and your cost for the five year remaining portion of the contract. We feel good about our cost estimates as well as our revenue estimates based on what we see today. But we all know, IT needs will change overtime and frankly I think there is a good possibility that those revenue estimates will increase as we go through time and as the county addresses their needs. But based on what we see today we reflected what we see today in our revenue estimate as well as our cost estimate.
Doug Harned: Okay. Very good, thank you.
Ron Sugar: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Rob Spingarn representing Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
Robert Spingarn: Good afternoon.
James F. Palmer: Hi Rob.
Ron Sugar: Hi Rob.
Robert Spingarn: Just went back to the Gulf Coast again. I know we've asked about this a few times but Wes, are you saying that collaterally there any kind of delays that are programs are modest and accounted for here?
Wes Bush: Yes. That is our view. As I said we do a continuous and dynamic assessment of how we are allocating the resources. But as we've gone through that I think we have developed a very robust view of how we're going to complete all of the ships that we have in the inventory and the Gulf Coast. We've been working that closely with the navy. As you know, the navy's needs are clearly integrate part of our thought process here because these are ships that the navy is counting on for deployment. And so that has to be a factor as we consider how we go about not only finishing off LHD-8 but finishing off the other things that we have in the inventory in the near term. And, so, we have a robust plan in place. We've made those resource allocations. We're managing to it very precisely. And as I said we fell good about how the team is doing in the Gulf Coast addressing that full set of opportunities.
Robert Spingarn: Okay. And so on that basis, Jim, your guidance implies a margin basically around 9% rest of the year. Do you feel comfortable with that?
James F. Palmer: Yes. I do.
Robert Spingarn: And is that a sustainable margin? Is that what this business should be earning? We take a clean year like 2009 presumably clean, a 2009 year could be 9% all year?
James F. Palmer: Well, Robert I go back to investor conference. I talked about the shipbuilding business as potentially having 10% plus margins. I intuitively believe that is the opportunity space that we look at it. As I said, this is a really a long-term business. The progress there will take some time but I do expect us to make steady progress.
Robert Spingarn: So, let me ask you in a different way. Is there anything about the mix as you enter the next year that would put negative pressure on the margins exiting this year?
James F. Palmer: We are going to be completing CDN 77 and moving CDN 78 new carrier contract. Front-end of that contract will tend to be a little bit more conservative in our earning recognition upfront on that contract just because it's at the very front-end of that construction if you will. So yes, there could be some near term impact of those that kind of mix issue. But on a long-term basis, again my view of business is not different than what we've talked about in the past.
Robert Spingarn: Okay. And then just a quick thing, Jim, and then another question for Ron. I can't recall if you have talked about the R&D tax credit in your guidance. But if you could just refresh us on that?
James F. Palmer: Yes. Our tax rate guidance does not include that the 34% number for effective tax rate for the year. Does not include the potential benefit of reinstatement of the R&D tax credit if that were to occur.
Robert Spingarn: And can you quantify what that would be?
James F. Palmer: Again, if it goes back to the beginning of the year, historically we've... the R&D tax credit has given us about 0.5% in terms of our effective tax rate.
Robert Spingarn: Okay. Thank you. And then Ron if you could just speak to your international opportunity set. I think your... just under 10% international maybe closer to seven or eight. But maybe with some of the opportunities are there? Thank you.
Ron Sugar: Well, it's close to seven and it continues. I see a kind of growing in proportion to our overall sales growth here Rob. I don't see it going faster or slower. There is opportunities in IS obviously and in Electronic systems. Those are prior our two major place. We are also looking at some opportunities in IT and MS. But I would say that over the next couple of years, we would probably see a continued peroration of the amount of the international business we have today, just on a larger base.
Robert Spingarn: Is there anything specific, may be in the surveillance area somewhere if they starts some other things out there?
Ron Sugar: Well, we have obviously the massive programs which are going now successively to places like Turkey and Korea. We have E2 opportunities in the marine press [ph], South Asia. We see some global hank opportunities as well, so we have a variety of things, which we're looking at. More F-18 sales will be helpful to us and a variety of work we are doing in the Middle-East with our allies there.
Robert Spingarn: Okay. Thank you very much.
Ron Sugar: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Heidi Wood, representing Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Heidi Wood: Good morning, guys.
Ron Sugar: Hi.
Heidi Wood: I confess, I do have a shipbuilding question, but I'll ask some others first, so I don't exhaust you totally. Can we talk a little bit about Mission Systems and give us a little more color on the margins there and describe what's happening, it's a work at Mission System?
James F. Palmer: I'm sorry. What was the last part of that Heidi, what work?
Heidi Wood: The mixed work, Jim, how we think specific mix of work at that Missions?
James F. Palmer: I don't know that I am seeing a significant chain, excuse me Heidi, in mix of work at Mission Systems. As I said in my comments, the 11% margin last year was very high for that business. It did reflect a greater amount of favorable contract adjustments and then what we would normally expect to have in that business in a quarter. So it essentially is just whine down last year, the a couple of programs versus what occurred this year.
Heidi Wood: Okay. And on F-35, my understanding is on the STD stays, Lockheed does not book a fee on your portion of the work. First, I would love to get color on the performance grades you are getting on your customer on that. And secondly, as during negotiations are happening to full rate production, I know no Lockheed is trying to get sea on your work. Do you have any say in those negotiations and does it have a different margin implication on whether you continue to go directly with your customer or if you go through Lockheed production phase?
James F. Palmer: While Heidi I can't conceive of any scenario which we would not work closely with our customer as there supplier that's how we entered the job years ago, it's been a great partnership in terms of the... I have no visibility into that. That's not something I know about. I can tell you that our relationship has been strong. Our performance on our part of the program has been extremely strong. We are in a good pre-production activities in Palmdale. Very strong engineering connection with the whole team. So, overall I am very pleased with how things are going. I think we are very much in offset that. I would say the integration of management this program is as good as anything I've ever seen.
Heidi Wood: Okay. And the two contracts that are being protested bands and tanker, did you keep them in backlog?
Ron Sugar: Yes, we did.
Heidi Wood: Okay. Alright so now, I'm sorry, but I kind of want to also understand ship. So, I have to hark in a little bit off Rob's question just to make sure I understood it. The, Wes, you have talked about successful completion of electronic cabling being sort of a pivotal point in the third quarter. And it looks like again further release that some schedule impact under the ship program due to LHD-8. So is it a correct read to understand that you need us to be successful in order to remain on schedule with the ship programs and therefore these ship margin rates you are assuming for a second half of '08 is kind of contingent on this?
Unidentified Company Representative: Heidi, let me harp in back to what we said at the end of the first quarter, when we went through a somewhat detailed description of the LHD-8 set of issues and the related implications and other programs. Because we extended the LHD-8 schedule, as a result of the cabling issues that we found earlier this year, we had to deploy resources on to LHD-8 that were otherwise intended to go to the other ship programs. So when we announced the issues associated with the 8, the charge for the 8 and the scheduled delayed for the 8. In parallel, we talked about the implications on the other ships NDR down in Pascagoula primarily. And since that time, we have been executing on that schedule that we've laid out. We have been working with Navy to make sure that the application of those resources as they are coming off of the 8 are prioritized in the right directions on to right ships. And the financial projections that we've laid out that Jim described a little bit earlier, all consistent with that perspective of that the delayed application of resources to the other ships relative to where we would have been earlier in the year prior to the discovery of the issues on the 8.
Heidi Wood: Right, but what's that I don't feel like I understand is, do you feel that you need the same resource intensity in the second half of the year as you complete this program or does the mechanics of what you do mean that you don't have the same intensities.
Unidentified Company Representative: No, we've been rolling people off of the 8 already, Heidi. And as we go to through the year, we'll continue to reduce the manning on the 8, apply those resources to the other ships. And actually that help support the testing program as it gets underway by having less people on board the ship. So that's all on integrated plan and we are executing to it on plan so far.
Heidi Wood: Okay. And Jim, you talked about your confidence in ships being a 10% margin business, but it appeared to Rob's question that you're somewhat demurred on visibility on 2009. Is it a fair read that these more normalized 10% margin are more achievable in 2010 than to be expected in 2009? Or can you give us a little more color in your expectations next year?
James F. Palmer: Heidi, we haven't given guidance on 2009. I was talking long term, in terms of my opportunity, my view of where I see ship building margins going. So I am going to differ 2009 until we give full guidance for 2009. And as you recall from our investor conference margins and ship building in 2012, our targets, our goals for 2012 were not at that 10% plus margin range. They were more like 10% as I recall. And we talked about opportunities to improve margins beyond that to potentially 10% to 11%. Again this is a very long-term business.
Heidi Wood: Great, thanks very much gentlemen.
Unidentified Company Representative: Thank you, Heidi.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol representing JPMorgan. Please proceed.
Joseph Nadol: Thanks, Good morning.
Unidentified Company Representative: Hi, Joe.
Unidentified Company Representative: Hi, Joe.
Joseph Nadol: First question is back on ships, but it's not LHD-8 or the margins it's actually on sales. I'm just wondering why with the strong quarter and the reasons you gave that sort of the math you gave on the 13% adjusted organic growth.
Unidentified Company Representative: Right.
Joseph Nadol: But why the back of your guidance implies the back half is down so much from last year, I mean even down sequentially second half from the first half?
Ron Sugar: Joe, in a way it goes also to Wes's comments, answers to Heidi. Essentially as you know, we essentially have a stable work force in the Gulf Coast. We are working more overtime right now to help to complete a number of ships that are very close to either builder trials or acceptance trials. And so I do expect as we go through the balance of the year that overtime may come down. So the cost input if you will on a number of ships will be lower in the second half than it is... than it was in the quarter. We will be more complete on LHD-8 for example. And so as we go through time, I do expect the pace of cost input to slow as we go through the year resulting in lower sales in the second half.
Joseph Nadol: Is that... how is that staying to margins, because when we think it's a little less leverage on your overhead maybe, it doesn't matter, because it's all kind of contracts accounting anyway, but obviously that kind of hurt you.
Ron Sugar: You are right, it does not matter, we've considered potentially lower overtime into our cost estimates as we've looked at these programs. And so we essentially will have the same margins whether or not we work the overtime, it's just essentially schedule-driven if you will. How we mitigate our post-schedule forward or leave it where it's presently planned.
Joseph Nadol: Okay and then on DDG-1000, just to try to quantify that a little bit, is this is it fair to say that if you shift, it would start to impact you probably in 2010, but directionally it's still a tough to say it depends on a lot of unknowns?
Ron Sugar: Yes, well first of all let me make it clear. There is a rumor and a very short release indicating that was a thought about doing this. Best I can tell both the House and Senate appropriation marks have long lead funding in the reports of third DDG-1000. So I think we've got the usual public debate ahead of us for a while. But assuming it happens, you have recognize that you get more margin on the DDG... sorry more sales volume on DDG-1000. But we will typically make more margins on DDG-51. So even though there's less sales volume and typically you'll probably see a more DDG-51s in replacement for whatever DDG-1000s would not be purchased. So I think we really basically playing contingency games at this point in time. But as I indicated, the time crowns [ph] since are long enough here that we don't have a great deal hangs to associated with this. We will work through with our customer and overtime, we see where it takes us. The great thing we have going here is that our shipyard is capable of producing higher class of ship and we think it's the Navy's job to decide which ones they want.
Joseph Nadol: Ron, just one more on that; would you anticipate that if we did go back to DDG-51 that they would be kind of an updated design or you think it would be the ones that you already, very similar to the ones you already have in the backlog in terms of the systems?
Ron Sugar: Well Joe, that's hard to speculate, it's a great ship now, it has a great modern design; and it will be what it is. I mean if it's going to be the same ship that's great. If they want to put some improvements on it, that's fine. We certainly know how to build it.
Joseph Nadol: Okay. And then just one more over on electronic; if you excess the Wedgetail charger, you are very consistent with the margins in a first quarter, 13.3, 13.4 is kind of where you're running. Obviously your guidance for the year calls for, lower margins in the second half. Jim, is that... I mean is it fair to say that it is contingency because you do have these programs you have placed on every quarter Wedgetail block-60 and a couple of others and that if... in a best case scenario, your second half margin could kind of be in line what you did in the first-half extra wage sales charge.
James F. Palmer: That 12% is a... trying to look at every thing we see, that is our expectations for the year. You are right it could mean that margins come down in the balance for the year, will it actually happen? I don't know. But as I look at the business in the 12% range, makes sense to me. Remember as well that we $19 million of additional royalty income in the first quarter, which affects the margin rates somewhat. So whether we are going to have the same amount of royalty income in the second half of the year. At this point I don't know, Joe,
Wes Bush: Joe, I guess just one other little flavor to it: as I indicated it earlier, we had quite a bit of success over the last year and a half. And capturing really good solid backlog in electronics. Our team is bearing and also addressing its marketplace. Some of the things we've been capturing are developmental programs that later transition to production. And so we watch as that mixed ships and that could have a little bit of impact here. But overall I think we are all characterized electronics as an organization is performing extraordinarily well.
Joseph Nadol: Okay good. Thank you.
Wes Bush: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Richard Safran, representing Goldman Sachs. Please proceed
Richard Safran: Good morning.
Unidentified Company Representative: Good morning, Richard.
Richard Safran: Just wondering a quick question if I could on share count. If I think you said previously that full your share count would be down around 2% for the year. And it looks like you already headed that year-to-date. So, and that's if I use your share count at the end of 2007. So do you have any revision to your share count guidance for the full year? And I guess more importantly, should we be as a result of this, should we be expecting some kind of change in your cash deployment strategy?
James F. Palmer: Rich,you are right. We are down about 3% versus the 2% estimate. We spent little bit over $800 million on share repurchases year-to-date. So essentially, in the six months, we have completed a third of the program that we announced last year. As I said in my comments about, cash deployment strategy, we don't expect that the timing the cash flow will impact our cash deployment strategy. I don't have a new forecast of our share count number, but essentially it all went into our 490 to 515 range for earnings per share for the year.
Richard Safran: Okay, thanks. And just lastly just one book keeping thing: could you tell me what was your for pension what you return on planned assets were for 2Q?
James F. Palmer: For the quarter... well, let me answer it year-to-date.
Richard Safran: Sure.
James F. Palmer: Year-to-date we are negative about 4.5%, so pretty far off our long term expected rate of 8.5%, but actually better than our benchmarks.
Richard Safran: Okay, thank you very much.
James F. Palmer: Thank you, Rich.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr representing Cowen & Company. Please proceed.
Cai von Rumohr: Thank you. Fast cash was a plus 69 million in the second quarter, up 10 million from the first quarter. Why and where do you expect that to be for the year?
James F. Palmer: The why is essentially finalizing our cash allowable expenses, so there was an improvement of about $10 million in terms of cash allowable costs from our original estimates for the year $10 million for... on a year-to-date basis booked in the second quarter. On a go forward basis, I would expect the net difference to be about $5 million off the pace of the second quarter.
Cai von Rumohr: So really just add $5 million to each of the third and fourth quarter essentially from where we were?
James F. Palmer: No, I guess I don't know where you were, but the second quarter.
Cai von Rumohr: Got it, okay; got it. And then on the Santiago, you kind of mentioned $12 million; was that accumulated [ph] catch charge or was just kind of a look forward change in accrual rate?
James F. Palmer: Cume catch adjustment.
Cai von Rumohr: Cume catch; so on a go-forward basis, it should be more profitable than it was in that quarter.
James F. Palmer: Well.
Cai von Rumohr: Or less unprofitable.
James F. Palmer: Let's say, the Santiago program essentially has zero margin.
Cai von Rumohr: Okay.
James F. Palmer: So this is again a cume catch adjustment that did contribute to negative margins in the quarter on a go-forward basis. I would look for them to have basically zero margins.
Cai von Rumohr: Got it, okay. And last one if we look at ISG, upper end of your guidance is that revenues will be $9.5 billion. To get there, I mean you would have to be down in the second half from the first half. Is that conservative or if you are going to be down in second half, is there going to be integrated systems in space and why [ph]?
James F. Palmer: Can I... there can be some movement around this guidance, a small amount; again I feel pretty good about the $33 billion. Some of the sectors are going to be at the upper end of the guidance. And I think maybe one of them maybe at the low end. But on an overall basis, so rather than pick on individual sectors again the 33 billion is it feels really good to me. Some of them are going to be some of the individual segments are going to be high end and some of them are going to be low end. Some of them actually beat by small amount, but...
Cai von Rumohr: No, no, I can understand that. But you gave a good answer in terms of why electronics should be better than the second half, a good answer why ships should be lower in the second half. And so there must be a reason, because you this is at the upper end of your estimate, you have to be couple $100 million or $150, $200 million lower per quarters than you were in the second quarter and lower than you were in the first. So I mean there are any one or two factors that if you were at the upper end of your guidance for that sector, they would have you down in the second half. Is it maybe a conservative estimate?
James F. Palmer: Maybe a conservative estimate, by $100 million, but got.
Cai von Rumohr: Okay.
James F. Palmer: These are really big programs and the timing of cost input into those really make a difference on what is recognized to sales, so...
Cai von Rumohr: Okay, excellent. Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Troy Lahr representing Stifle Nicolaus. Please proceed.
Troy Lahr: Thanks. I just wanted to drill down a little bit on the integrated systems, the margins sequentially down in year-over-year down. Is this just the mix shift? Is that really all that is and just timing and eventually that's just start swinging back again?
Unidentified Company Representative: That's why... basically is due to the $27 million one-time favorable resolution or prior overhead issues that occurred in last year's second quarter. But for that item, aerospace margins as well as integrated systems are actually up.
Troy Lahr: Okay, so there was also then onetime items in the first quarter when they were 12.7?
Unidentified Company Representative: I'm sorry, you were referring to...
Troy Lahr: I am sayingyear-over-year they are down, and sequentially quarter-over-quarter they are down. First quarter you did 12.7, I said was there just some one time items in that in the first quarter.
Unidentified Company Representative: There are always earnings adjustments on individual contracts. We look at our EACs on a standard basis as we go through the year and so that the adjustments on individual contracts can have an impact on quarterly revenues and earnings, and the change from one quarter to the next.
Troy Lahr: Okay, so outside of some one time items I mean we should generally view integrated systems as this is kind of a sustainable 10.5% run rate. Is that the way I should look at this business?
Unidentified Company Representative: I think our margin, our guidance for this business is for aerospace is the 10% margin grade [ph].
Troy Lahr: Okay. In JLTV, do you guys have an update on the down select and what's your seeing on that. Has that got shifted out a little bit to push up to the rail a little bit?
Ron Sugar: Yes, Troy, this is Ron. It has been... we believe there is the source selection process is well along. I think the issue is the desire on the part of the Department of Defense to have the army award or perhaps three parallel contracts, not just two, and so there is a matter of making sure the funding is in line. I think it's another $60 million or so required to do that. So there are some interaction going similar action going on. With the Congress, the budgeting process. And we've seen that moving to the right. I think the program is still struggling on a high priority. The idea of having three is to really allow the broadest range of technologies in the mix as early as possible, given that this thing is going to be bigger tankers. It's probably when it's all finished in terms of the number of vehicles produced the amount of money that spent on it. So and as you know there are, I think about six of us in the running. And we are very excited about our offering, and we'll see how it plays out as we get into the fall.
Troy Lahr: Okay so you are thinking like September, October, November for down select...
Ron Sugar: Yes, I guess, but I will tell you, I have... long ago, decades ago, given up forecasting when procurements down selections will occur.
Troy Lahr: Great, okay. Thanks, guys
Unidentified Company Representative: Thanks Troy.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard, representing Macquarie. Please proceed.
Robert Stallard: Good afternoon.
Unidentified Company Representative: Hello Robert.
Robert Stallard: I am going to ask you about ships. I thought I should ask a follow up on the Wes's comments about information technology and the opportunity there to improve the margin. What sort of bench marks are you looking at the target margin what sort of time frames are we considering. And how structure you are going to achieve this given the cost plus basis when it is contracts?
Wes Bush: Well, that's really a good question. It really goes to the mix of the types of business that we pursue in the IT space. We have some as you know some very high margin businesses associated with some of the technical professional services if you will, capabilities we provide in the intelligence arena, blend that with some of the much lower margin businesses that we have in the IT outsourcing businesses, and the... I would say more moderate margin rates that we get as you reference to some of the cost plus businesses, where we take on development activities and provide large scale software solutions to a number of large enterprise customers in the Federal government. So going forward as we look at that market space with those with that wide variance of different rates, when we make our decisions about our portfolio mix, we are both looking at both the actual margin rates themselves as well as the returns we generate on some of these contracts. So if you are asking for a specific number, we have talked about them in a mid to high single digits. But it's that's blend as we forward that will shape, where we actually in-depth in that range. And we are taking a I would say a very economic view of making those decisions based on both the margin rates themselves as well as the actual returns we get out of it. If we wanted to shape this solely around returns, we could of course get this into the high single digits and in some cases into the low double digit margin rates. And we have that opportunity, but we think we can actually do better in the overall economics of business by being attentive to both the return side of the equation as well as the rate.
Robert Stallard: Presumably it's going to take a while to work off some of may be some of the lower return programs so this is probably a long term 4 to 5...
Wes Bush: It takes a while, but the IT business has a much faster cycle on this program base than our large hardware businesses do impact. I think the average spend time on a large fraction of our contact base in IT is measured in months or a small number of years. So the turning radius isn't quite the same as it is in our air craft business or our ship building business. So we have a little bit more opportunity to see a faster rise time.
Robert Stallard: Okay. That's great thank you.
Unidentified Company Representative: Yes, thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Harry Nourse representing Bank of America. Please proceed.
Harry Nourse: Good morning.
Unidentified Company Representative: Good morning, Harry.
Harry Nourse: Could you just tell us is the amount of Katrina related revenues next year still expected to be about $350 million or is that changed?
James F. Palmer: Essentially about the same, yes.
Harry Nourse: About the same, excellent. And then looking ahead to 2009 obviously you are in long range plan caused us an average of 6% sales growth; is that the right area for next year and perhaps you might have an idea of which areas of the business might be growing faster than others.
James F. Palmer: I don't agree and give guidance so for '09. We did lay out some objectives for 2012. And I think you can look at those and make some judgments, but we are not prepared today to give guidance early for '09.
Harry Nourse: So you couldn't tell us which areas might be grand parts and others or just any indication?
James F. Palmer: I don't think so, not today.
Harry Nourse: Okay, thanks.
Ron Sugar: Okay let me just wrap up. I think we're already over the hour. This was a solid quarter. Second quarter came in well for us, we believe. We are looking for strengthening our margins and our cash in the second half. I am very comfortable with achieving the 2008 guidance we've laid out. And with that, I would like to end the call and thank you all for joining us.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in Northrop Grumman's second quarter earnings conference call. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Good day.

Please go now to slide 3 and at this time I'd like to turn the call over to Ron.
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you Gaston and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us to discuss our first quarter earnings. As we announced last week, we are reporting a charge to earnings this quarter for LHD-8 and related impacts at our Gulf Coast shipyard. We believe we have appropriately bounded its impact and we are taking all necessary corrective actions. Wes Bush will provide additional discussion and the specific milestones by which you can measure our progress as we move forward. Although the LHD-8 charge is deeply disappointing, the remainder of our first-quarter performance was strong. This morning we also announced an increase in our quarterly common stock dividend. The new quarterly dividend is $0.40 per share, up from $0.37. This is the fifth consecutive annual increase in the dividend. We have doubled our dividend since 2003, which represents a compound annual growth rate of nearly 15%. This most recent increase demonstrates the confidence we, and our Board have in the company's financial strength and outlook. We continue to execute a balanced cash deployment strategy that includes dividends and share repurchases. Our dividend policy calls for maintaining a competitive payout ratio. This increase demonstrates our commitment to that policy. We also repurchased 7.6 million shares of stock during the quarter for $600 million, which leaves us with $1.9 billion for additional repurchases on our current authorization. And lastly, earlier this week, we closed the sale of our Electro-Optical Systems business for cash proceeds of $175 million and a small after-tax gain. Now, I'll briefly discuss first quarter results before turning the call over to Wes and Jim. With the exception of our Gulf Coast shipyards, we continue to see performance improvements across our programs and businesses. It was a particularly strong quarter for new business awards. We captured $12.1 billion in new business awards, increasing total backlog by 7% to $68 billion, another record for this company. We continue to see a strong flow of orders across all our businesses with backlog increases for Aerospace, Electronics and Ship Building. The obvious highlight of this quarter was the KC-45 Tanker win. The United States Air Force selected Northrop Grumman for development and production of up to 179 air refueling tanker aircrafts for approximately $35 billion. The Air Force announced that Northrop Grumman's offer clearly represented the best overall value to the government. Our competitor has filed a protest to the Air Force's decision with the Government Accountability Office and we wait the GAO's determination regarding that protest, which is due no later than June 19th. We are looking forward to a successful resolution of the protest and getting on with building the first of the KC-45 tankers, which are sold greatly needed by our war fighting men and women. In addition to the tanker award, we were also awarded $1.4 billion for the DDG 1001 Destroyer and major components for the DDG 1000. We also continue to be very successful in the restricted arena with several of our businesses capturing significant restricted contract awards, which in total represent approximately $2.6 billion in new awards. Shortly after the close of the quarter, our mission system sector won a large position on Joint Tactical Radio System JTRS AMF as a member of the Lockheed Martin team. And this week, Northrop Grumman was awarded the Navy's $1.2 billion Broad Area Maritime Surveillance contract or BAMS. This award highlights our leadership position in unmanned ariel systems, our legacy of innovative engineering to fulfill critical customer requirements and our ability to win the large improvement competitions. BAMS is another key strategic victory, the third in a series of major competitive aircraft wins that began with the Navy's UCAS-D last fall and also includes the KC-45 refueling tanker win in February. With the UCAS-D, KC-45 and BAM, we have captured three of the largest of our near-term competitive opportunities. But many more very large new program competitions will be decided this year and next. These include the joint like tactical vehicle, Aerial common sensor, Global Positioning System Operational Control System or GPS-OCX, the VISX, which is a competitive follow-on to our very successful Vehicular Intercommunication System, The Kennedy Space Center support services contract and GOES-R, the environmental monitoring satellites. In addition to these, we also continue to have a significant competitive opportunity set in the restricted arena. We also expect a significant increase this year in contract follow on awards from our current portfolio of franchise programs. Examples are the CVN 78 construction contract and follow-ons to the Air Force Global Hawk, Space Based Infrared System and the F-A18 aircraft for Australia. Based on first quarter results, we continue to expect sales of $33 billion. We now expect 2008 earnings from continuing operations of $4.90 to $5.15 per share. And we now expect cash from operations of $2.6 billion to $2.9 billion and free cash flow of $1.7 billion to $2.1 billion. So looking ahead, we are winning major competitions, generating record backlog, growing our sales, expanding our margins, and executing our balance of cash deployment strategy all of which support our confidence in our ability to achieve the 2012 targets we laid out at the Investor Conference in February. We continue to be very confident and excited about the future of Northrop Grumman. Now, I will turn the call over to Wes Bush. Wes?
Wes Bush - President and Chief Operating Officer: Thanks, Ron. My comments are outlined on slide five and will include more detail on the LHD-8 path forward so that on future calls we will be able to update our progress against those milestones. But before discussing LHD-8, I want to touch on operational highlights on some other programs of interest to you in our Electronics and Information Technology businesses. I'm pleased to report that during the quarter we continued to move forward on all of these programs, making progress towards completion and working within our current estimates to complete. Block 60 Falcon Edge software is achieving intermediate delivery milestones towards scheduled delivery of the third increment of electronic warfare capability in the second half of 2008. The second of three intermediate milestones was delivered in the first quarter, as planned, and the next increment is backing the schedule. On Wedgetail, we've completed the development, test and evaluation phase of the program and completed the delivery of the software build to support the tight acceptance test in evaluation phase, which is scheduled to start this quarter and will continue into the third quarter. The start of this phase was delayed somewhat by customer activities but this does not impact our performance to the EAC. On our state and local outsourcing contracts, Virginia continues to move through transformation and has completed key milestones. The transformation activities will be completed this summer and the program will begin to deliver recurring services from the transformed environment on schedule in July. Ongoing infrastructure consolidation continues to the middle of 2009 as scheduled under the contract. On our county of San Diego program, we completed transition last year. We've made good progress through stabilization and we're focusing on recurring service delivery. The program team is working to leverage transition improvements to drive efficiency in ongoing operations. The New York City wireless program achieved initial operating capability on March 31st. This first go-live event represents a tremendous achievement by our team. We're continuing to build out the network and anticipate completion this year. As this impressive capability nears completion, we expect to be adding new services in the future, further enhancing the utility of the network for the city. Now, I would like to discuss LHD-8 and the path forward on the program. We have reset the schedule based on the revised DAC an established key milestones to measure progress. The first major milestone is the aft main engine light off that's scheduled during the second quarter. When this milestone is complete both the forward and the aft engines will have been light off and both shafts will have been turned. This milestone establishes that the main propulsion plants are working. As we indicated last week, a key driver of our schedule is the work to be performed on the electrical cabling of the ship. During the third quarter, we plan to complete the electrical cabling installations throughout the ship. Accomplishment of this milestone is key to our ability to support the test program on the revised time line that we have established. In the fourth quarter this year, we will perform the integrated propulsion test, that’s required prior to builder's trials. This test simultaneously runs both engines at the power level supportable with pure site testing. And finally, builder’s trials at sea will begin in the first quarter of 2009 preparatory to schedule delivery in the second quarter of '09. In addition to identifying a comprehensive set of milestones as a part of the revised schedule, we have changed the profile of our systems test sequence to ensure that we identify any residual issues early in the rework cycle. As I mentioned on the call last week, I am reviewing progress on LHD-8 on a weekly basis and we are addressing the issues that led to cost and schedule growth to variety of programmatic, systemic and leadership actions. I'll provide a report on our progress on LHD-8 at each of our quarterly conference calls. I focused my comments today on the set of programs that we previously identified with operational challenges. Looking across our portfolio of over 20,000 programs in the company, I think it's important to note that we are delivering high quality products, while continuing to improve our program margin rates. This is the fundamental driver of performance in our company and it's on track to support the accomplishment of our long-term financial objectives. So now I will turn the call over to Jim to discuss the financial results. Jim?
James F. Palmer - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Wes. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. In my comments this morning, I'm going to discuss the first quarter financial highlights, including the breakdown of the ship building charge, describe our cash trends for the quarter and then move on to a discussion of guidance for the remainder of the year. I'd like to begin by pointing out a change to schedule five of the earnings release. Today's presentation includes new business awards rather than funded contract acquisitions. We've made this change because new business awards is a better measure of the business that we are actually capturing. It can be reconciled to sales and total backlog changes for the period and makes more sense when calculating our book-to-bill ratio for the quarter. Our old measure, funded contract acquisitions simply measure funding on new awards or old awards for which funding had just been received. Thus, it did not represent new business awarded or captured during the period. Using the new business award ratio, we had a very strong book-to-bill ratio for the quarter of nearly 150%[ph]. Beginning with slide 6, we also had a solid 6% sales growth in the first quarter, this is net of $134 million reduction for the step back in revenue resulting from the EAC adjustments in ship building for LHD-8. Without this adjustment, sales growth would have been approximately 7.5%. The trends in three of the four businesses are consistent with our expectations and indicate that continuation of the same positive trends we saw in 2007. For information and services, 6% sales growth includes double-digit sales growth admission systems, mid-single digit growth for information technology and a small decline in revenue for technical services. One of the primary growth drivers for information and services is continued strength in our intelligence business at IT and mission systems. This strength includes revenue ramp up on existing programs and new business capture as well. State and local programs like New York City Wireless and the Virginia IT Outsourcing program also contributed to this sales growth, but to a lesser extent than last year. The other revenue driver in the quarter for information and services was IT's NETCENTS contract for the Air Force. In last year's 4th quarter we received a task order under this contract for defense knowledge online, which generated hardware and service sales in the first quarter. Moving to aerospace, sales rose 4%. Both integrated systems and space technology had positive comparisons to the prior year period. This is a reversal of the recent trend we've seen at integrated systems. For the last several quarters, the transition from development to production for programs like JSF and Advance Hawkeye have impacted sales. The slowdown of MP, RTIP and the cancellation of the E-10A also impacted sales. These trends are still in place, but this quarter's higher volume for existing programs like Global Hawk and new revenue from new programs like Navy UCAS-D, restricted work, and KC-45 tanker program are more than offsetting these declines. The tanker sales reflect the work we began before the Air Force issued its stop work order due to our competitor's protest. Moving to space, the trends here are also consistent with prior quarters, we continue to see higher revenue in the restricted programs and in the James Webb Space Telescope program. Sales increases here are partially offset by lower revenue for other programs including AEHF, STSS and TCAF. Electronic sales rose 2% and include higher sales to the army for the lightweight laser designator/range finders and the vehicle intercommunications systems. Sales also rose in shipbuilding. The increase includes $48 million in revenue from fleet support, which represents revenue now being booked for AMSAC, as well as approximately $80 million for surface combatant programs. Increases in other programs were largely offset by the $134 million step back in revenue resulting from the LHD-8 EAC adjustment. Moving on to operational performance in slide 7, information and services expanded its margin rate by 50 basis points, aerospace expanded its margin rate by 30 basis points and electronics likewise expanded its margin rate by 80 basis points. In all three businesses, overall program performance improved. For electronics, program performance improved for electrical optical and infrared counter measure programs, as well as land forces programs. In addition, royalty income was higher than in the prior year period. The royalty income represents settlements of third party licensing and patent disputes relating to fiber-optic technology originating with Litan [ph], one of our heritage companies. For our aerospace program performance improved that both Integrated Systems and Space Technology. In restricted programs the EA-18G, B2 and the airborne laser programs. On a consolidated basis, the ship building charge reduced segment margin rate by a little bit more than 400 basis points. Without the charge, segment margin rates would have been nearly 10% compared with 9.5% in 2007 first quarter. With the exception of our Gulf coast shipyards, we continue to see performance improvements across programs and businesses. The charge and shipbuilding totaled $326 million. $272 million of the charge is for the LHD-8 program. $35 million represents the resource impact and risk adjustments to other Gulf coast ships and $19 million is the non-cash write down of purchase intangibles resulting from the adjustments to EAC for these programs. Of the $272 million for LHD-8, about $180 million is for test, integration and rework, and approximately $70 million is for the scheduled extension and the associated level of effort that continues as the schedule is extended. Our total operating margin rate includes improvements in the net pension adjustment and comparable quarter-over-quarter amounts of corporate and allocated expenses. Excluding the impact of the charge, our total operating margin would have been 10%. , a 60 basis point improvement over last year. Other than the issues in shipbuilding, the positive trends in our businesses are very much in evidence in this quarter's results. Other notable items affecting the first quarter include the increase in other net, an income of $15 million from the expense of $8 million last year. This primarily represents the increase in royalty income over the prior year period, which I mentioned earlier. Offsetting these improvements is an effective tax rate of 35.7% this quarter. Since the adoption of FIN 48 in last year's first quarter, our income tax expense also includes interest expense related to what FIN 48 would characterize as uncertain tax positions. Although this interest cost is relatively a stable dollar amount from quarter-to-quarter, it represents a proportionally larger component of this quarter's total tax expense, and increased the tax rate by nearly 1.5 percentage points. This quarter's higher tax rate also includes the expiration of the research and development tax credits at the end of last year. Moving on to cash on slide 8, cash from operations was $194 million for the quarter, down from $400 million last year. Historically the first quarter is normally low, and that is obviously the case this year as well. In addition, during the first quarter this year, two of our sectors were transitioning to an accounting software system that is common with other parts of our business. This transition had a timing impact on billings that increased accounts receivables by about $200 million, which we had anticipated. The transition to the common system is now essentially complete, we do expect to recover the majority of this amount in the second quarter. That leads me to our updated 2008 financial guidance for the business, which is summarized on slide 9. Our sales guidance for each of the four businesses is unchanged. We continue to expect consolidated sales of approximately $33 billion. For operating margin rate, we continue to expect low 8% for information and services. We are increasing our guidance for aerospace operating margin to approximately 10% from the mid 9% range. Likewise, we're also increasing our guidance for electronics by approximately 50 basis points. We now expect a mid 12% margin rate there. The outlook for ships has been adjusted for this quarter's charge and the ongoing impact of the step-down in margin rates going forward. So we now expect margin rates of about 3% for ship building in 2008. Slide 10 summarizes prior and the updated guidance, the change in the segment margin rates, results in a consolidated segment margin rate of mid-to-high 8%, about 100 basis points lower than our prior guidance. And after allocating for expenses and the net pension adjustment, we would expect our total operating margin rate to be in the high 8% range for 2008, again about 100 basis points lower than our prior guidance. We continue to expect a tax rate of approximately 34% for the year. For our earnings per share from continuing operations, we've adjusted the guidance for the 100 basis point reduction in segment as well as total operating margin rates. As I mentioned, this reflects the impact of this quarter's ship building charge as well as the impact for the remainder of the year from the LHD collateral impacts to other ships. That impact to earnings for the remainder of the year is about $0.10, but the increased margin in ES and aerospace offset somewhat the ship building earnings per share reductions giving us an updated guidance of $4.90 to $5.15 per share. Now, looking at cash, the impact of the ship building charge reduced our prior 2008 guidance by $200 million. We now expect cash from operations of $2.6 billion to $2.9 billion, and free cash flow of $1.7 billion to $2.1 billion. And we do expect our cash to be more back end loaded this year with performance becoming progressively stronger as we move through the year. This does reflect the impact of the transition to the new common accounting system in the first quarter, as well as tax payments, which will be made in the second quarter. I would echo Ron's comments regarding our commitment to our balance cash deployment strategy. Given the momentum we are seeing in new business awards, our record backlog, the strength of our balance sheet and our strong outlook for cash we expect to continue our balance cash deployment strategy going-forward. Also as Ron said, we don't see the ship building charge as impacting our long-term view of the health and potential of our business. We continue to have confidence in our 2012 financial targets as shown on slide 11. This includes our outlook for ship building as well. We continue to see significant opportunities to improve performance in this business on a go-forward basis. One of those performance improvement drivers will obviously be completing and delivering the ships that have been impacted by hurricane Katrina. Although this will take a little bit longer than we had previously anticipated, it is still likely to be essentially completed by the end of the 2009 as we have previously planned. So, Gaston, that completes my comments at this point. I'm ready to turn the call over to you for questions and answers.
Gaston Kent - Vice President of Investor Relations: Okay. Thanks, Jim. Lacy, we're ready for Q&A please. Question and Answer
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question will come from the line of Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, guys. It is Peter Skibitski [ph] actually.
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Pete.
Unidentified Analyst: On the 3% ship margin for the year there, I just wanted to ask that kind of imply the teams were on 8.5% or so Q2 to Q4. Do we think of that as the increased level across the last three quarters, or is there kind of going to be a ramp there and is there any reason for the Street to think that '09 will be below the level of last three quarters?
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Pete, your perspective on the remainder of the year is essentially as I see it as well. I do expect a ramp as we go through time both this year and then into next year.
Unidentified Analyst: Got you. And then I wanted to ask as well. Given that the revenue takedown this quarter in ships, should that lead us to believe your ship revenue guidance is going to be towards the lower end as you finish out the year, or is there still the possibility that we have to be upper end?
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I think the guidance of $200 million between the low and high is about what I see at this point in time.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Put some takes as the year goes on.
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Got you. Okay. I will get back in the queue. Thanks guys.
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: All right.
Operator: And the next question will come from the line of Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed.
Douglas Harned- Sanford Bernstein: Hi, good morning.
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Hi Doug.
Douglas Harned- Sanford Bernstein: On the ships, the 10% margins, you're looking 10% margins aside from the LHD-8 situation. That is up at the level that you're talking about long term. And the first thing I was interested in understanding is, do you see the shipyard now LHD-8 aside at currently being at a higher level, even closer to what you're long-term objectives are?
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Doug, at the Investor Conference in February, we talked about a longer-term view of the ship building business, having the potential to have margins in 10 to 11%. I think that is the… my view has not changed there on what that long term potential is. Clearly we, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, getting through the Katrina affected ships is important. And Mike and… Mike Petters and crew responsible for the shipbuilding program are really focused on improvements that we can drive across all of our ship building organizations and implementing those will be the key, I believe to achieving those longer-term objectives. But frankly, again, when I look at those objectives, and past performance, I don't really see a reason why we can't get there. It does mean, as I said, completing the Katrina affected ships, and being very diligent about our processes around ship building as we go forward.
Douglas Harned- Sanford Bernstein: But, do you see the performance levels you're at now aside from LHD-8 is getting closer to what you're going... I guess let me backup, if you look at 10%, is this sustainable type of a margin, as we are able to take the LHD-8 aside while or are there some benefits we saw in the quarter that were one-time in nature?
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Doug as Pete observed on the prior questions, we're really looking at about 8.5% margins on a go-forward basis for the rest of the year in shipbuilding. As I said that is essentially what is undermining our 3% margins for the year. That's really where I see us for this year.
Douglas Harned- Sanford Bernstein: And do you see anymore... when you go out to '09, do you expect to anymore pushback in revenues for the other ship programs as a result of LHD-8?
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: At this point, our guidance reflects everything we know.
Douglas Harned- Sanford Bernstein: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of Myles Walton with Oppenheimer. Please proceed.
Myles Walton - Oppenheimer & Co.: Good afternoon.
Wes Bush - President and Chief Operating Officer: Hi Myles.
Myles Walton - Oppenheimer & Co.: It looks like book-to-bill in Integrated Systems is particularly strong over two times in the quarter even excluding the tanker, obviously you have the tanker under protest, but assuming that goes through and BAMs following that with a win in the quarter. How much of that recent win activity is kind of anticipated in your five year plan at the Analyst Day, is this spade of wins here putting upward pressure on some of those projections?
James F. Palmer - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Myles, those wins were essentially anticipated in our view of the long-term. Just as I got the questions immediately after the Tanker win about whether we were going to increase our guidance or thoughts around 2012. Obviously we didn't, immediately prior to, or immediately after the Tanker win. As we said in our call today, the ship building charge doesn't change our view of the long term, nor does the one-quarter book-to-bill at this point in time. As both Ron and I, Wes said, we continue to have a great deal of confidence in our 2012 targets. And obviously the book-to-bill events of this quarter are important to achieving that, but we all know one quarter doesn't make the trend for the 5-year period. So, we feel good about it, feel good about the 2012 targets. And as Ron said, a lot of opportunities ahead of us, and we're going to go after those as aggressively as we have the three ones that we've achieved this year and last year.
Myles Walton - Oppenheimer & Co.: Okay, I appreciate them. Not trying to rob the numbers, just trying to get a feel for what was contemplated with respect to those. And then if I could, probe a little bit on the classified side, I appreciate you sharing the bookings. What was, I guess, can you put that in context to kind of what you do on an annual basis with respect to classified and just how much of an up tick is that that you've gone out and highlighted it?
James F. Palmer - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Myles, my perspective on the classified or restrictive, is that it is even more lumpy than any of the other businesses in which we participate, so, as we have mentioned in the past, we saw good opportunities in that restricted area, we've obviously brought some of those home this quarter. But we do see some other significant opportunities on a go forward basis that we're pursuing.
Myles Walton - Oppenheimer & Co.: And what's your annual restricted revenue?
Wes Bush - President and Chief Operating Officer: We don't disclose that, Myles.
Myles Walton - Oppenheimer & Co.: All right. Thanks.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of Ronald Epstein with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.
Ronald Epstein - Merrill Lynch: Yes. Hi, good afternoon, guys.
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Ron.
Ronald Epstein - Merrill Lynch: On some of the upcoming programs, right, you've got JLTV common sensor, some other stuff. When do you expect a decision on Aerial Common Sensor?
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I think Aerial Common Sensor is probably in the next year. There are a number of ways that the Army may choose to go forward on that, Ron. Clearly, there is the competition, which we are gearing up for and we feel very comfortable about our position there. In the meantime, as the Army is looking at that they are providing continuing upgrades to the existing legacy systems, Guardrail and others and we are actually participating very strongly in those as well. But I would say next year probably for the ACS.
Ronald Epstein - Merrill Lynch: Okay.
James F. Palmer - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: JLTV, we expect the down select to occur in the early part of the summer to get into the TD phase one that program.
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, the TD phase, of course, being the first phase, it's not huge dollars but it's extremely important for the three or so people to get involved in it. And then that leads into follow-ons later.
Ronald Epstein - Merrill Lynch: Okay, great. And just a follow-on... just another ship related question. You highlighted on the call, I guess, a week or so ago, and then today, some management change. Can you into more color on that? I mean, how are you changing the management in the shipyard so that --?
Wes Bush - President and Chief Operating Officer: Ron, it's Wes. Let me give you a broader view of that. First and foremost, as you're aware, we have announced earlier this year the integration of Newport News and what we previously called Ship Systems Sectors into our single integrated shipbuilding sector. And as a product of that decision, we are naturally going through the process of identifying both organizationally and on a personnel basis what the best assignments are and the best structure is to take the shipyard forward. We made an announcement just about a month ago that Irwin Edenzon from Newport News would be coming down from the Gulf coast to take on general management responsibilities. We've made some other announcements regarding individuals that are both supporting the ship building sector and supporting Irwin. Again, this is a stepped process to go through, and look at how we want to form this integrated organization going-forward to best execute the opportunities and the programs in shipbuilding.
Ronald Epstein - Merrill Lynch: I guess, more specific my question is after you guys learned about the LHD-8, did you make any management changes at that point?
Wes Bush - President and Chief Operating Officer: Yes, we certainly have gone through the process of looking at the way the organizations is approaching LHD-8. We made some changes in leadership on the program itself. And we are also of course, incorporating those lessons Ron as we form the overall organizational approach for the integrated sector.
Ronald Epstein - Merrill Lynch: Okay. Great. Thanks.
Wes Bush - President and Chief Operating Officer: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Heidi Wood with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Heidi Wood- Morgan Stanley: Good morning, Nice quarter guys.
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Heidi. All but, right?
Heidi Wood- Morgan Stanley: Exactly. So, a couple questions, Wes, just a point of clarification on the milestones that you put out on the LHD-8, are those the long polls in the 10 that will give you visibility as you progress as to whether the charges you've taken are sufficient? Or are there other things you'd point to as you pass through that would help us have confidence that again what you took was sufficient.
Wes Bush - President and Chief Operating Officer: Yes Heidi, I would characterize those milestones as critical in the overall sequence of events that is have to occur. The schedule that we've laid out is, as you may imagine is probably better characterized by [inaudible] it is a comprehensive approach to delineating all the work pass that have to occur. There are numerous pass, if you want to talk about critical pass through there that are important to getting us through it. We laid out those milestones, because they represent major increments of accomplishment. There are other things that we will include in our quarterly progress descriptions on how things are going to give you a fuller sense of the progress, and to your point our confidence in our ability to execute within the EAC that we've established.
Heidi Wood- Morgan Stanley: Okay, great. And then to understand a little bit the guidance on the Electronics because obviously that is pretty impressive and it looks like now that you're thinking this is a little more sustainable. So first, can you talk about what the royalty income was that you talked about in the first quarter? And also what underneath in Electronics, what businesses that are driving the bulk of the great performance?
James F. Palmer - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes. Heidi, the royalty amount for the first quarter was about $19 million improvement over the prior year. To a certain extent it was offset by some environmental cost accruals as well. So even though the royalty amount is $19 million there were some smaller offsets to it from an environmental cost accrual perspective. In terms of the areas that were driving the program performance improvement, it's essentially the items that I mentioned in my comments, which were the... I have to go back and find them here exactly, Electrical, Optical and the… basically Electrical, Optical areas
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I would just add that broadly Heidi, in our Electronic Systems Organization has put a lot of attention over the last couple of years on really driving on program performance. We are seeing the benefits of that comprehensively across the organization and if you will, the improvements that we have made in our performance within our EACs on programs that previously had been challenging for us. Those improvements obviously contribute to improved performance across the board in Electronics. So it's a fairly comprehensive.
Wes Bush - President and Chief Operating Officer: I would be back that up a bit because if you look at this several businesses of ES there's a remarkable consistency.
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Across the board.
Wes Bush - President and Chief Operating Officer: Good performances on all those businesses. They are not one star.
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes.
Heidi Wood- Morgan Stanley: All right. And then Ron I have a two questions for you, if you don't mind. We are seeing, it looks like a little bit of pickup in M&A activity Lockheed sort of talked about it, we are seeing it happening in Raytheon. Can you talk to us about your perspective and degree of interest in pricing, properties, what should we be anticipating in terms of Northrop's interest in M&A over the next year or so?
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I would say no change from what we told you in the last year or two, clearly when we see something that we think is extremely important or strategic to us, we think there's value there for everybody. We'll go for it, we've done that selectively. We've not done a lot of it, but we've done it selectively, we're pleased with, for example the Essex situation. That's worked out extremely well for us. So, Heidi I would say probably while we don't normally comment on M&A, we would be thinking about our overall balance cash strategy. We'll have adequate resources. You saw the dividend increase. We have $1.9 billion in our share repurchase, and as we see opportunities in the market, we'll look at. I wouldn't signal any significant change in the direction we've already announced.
Heidi Wood- Morgan Stanley: And then finally, I mean, I think I'm going to give you a little bit of a victory lap Ron. Because I remember a couple years ago, it seemed that Northrop was really struggling to win. It seemed like there were a number of things that you had lost and were disappointments, and I really feel like over the last couple years, I've seen that turn around quite visibly with a number of kind of impressive wins even. Can you talk about kind of fundamental changes you've implemented within the organization that might help explain sort of what we're seeing, the change in approach to competition. There may be a charge on some outsiders that you might be aggressively pricing to account for the wins. But what would your response be as to kind of why we're seeing these big wins?
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well Heidi, a couple years ago of course we had a couple high profile competitions, one or two in which we actually thought they were long-shot opportunities for us. We didn't win them, we got hammered pretty heavily for not winning what we thought were long shots. We fundamentally determined that we had to put together as we have in our operating side, set of process improvements in business acquisition in terms of learning better about the customer markets that we're proceeding with. Shaping these markets better, and frankly putting substantially more executive horsepower and strength on them, personal engagement for myself and the top team. We laid out a set of what we call corporate priority wins. We have that list, all companies do, but we put particular energy into them over the last several years. And we also basically had a fundamental belief that the technical solutions we would offer would in fact be the best value for the customer, we had to make sure they understood that as well. We've done an awful lot in that regard. What you're seeing here in a series of very, very successful outcomes is probably a lagging indicator of a lot of hard work that's been going on in the last couple years. And I will tell you that the intensity for this competitive spirit has not changed one bit. In fact if anything, has gotten stronger.
Heidi Wood- Morgan Stanley: All right. Thanks very much.
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks Heidi.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr of Cowen And Company. Please proceed.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company: Yes quick house keeping one. Was there any difference in number of billing days or work days in this quarter and kind of how does the year rollout in that respect?
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Cai, to my knowledge, there are no difference in billing days or workdays in the quarter.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company: Yes. The number of billing days or working days, everyone are... you guys look on it.
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: No, I don't know of any difference there of any magnitude at least.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company: Okay. Secondly, you know, on your LHD call, I guess we discussed that, since about 8% of the southern shipyard's workforce is going to be on LHD-8 and basically working on things where they don't make any money for a while. There would be some kind of a ripple effect in terms of revenues and profits on the rest of the southern shipyard. Could you walk us through kind of… quantify what those numbers and how should we think about how that works?
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Cai yes, we... let's see. Obviously there is going to be people associated with the LHD-8 for a little bit longer period of time that would have moved to other ships or essentially that delays the work on other ships resulting in a delay of revenue and earnings on those ships. So essentially that's the model that we've built into our guidance. The delay in other ships is important, but it is not of a magnitude frankly that is as I said causes those Katrina affected ships to move out beyond 2009 in terms of completion. So it is a little bit of movement between now and that period of time.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company: Okay.
James F. Palmer - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Let me add just a comment, Cai as well, just to put a little more perspective on it. The workforce that's needed on LHD-8 is a certain set of skills that are needed to address both the rework and the testing profile. So it is that set of skills that are delayed from accomplishing task on some of the other ships. The challenge then that we have is to make sure that we are doing everything we can to maintain schedule to the extent we can on the other ships, and that sometimes is done by re-profiling that work so that the skill sets can be redeployed in a different sequence. So I would not want anyone to have the perspective that because we're doing something longer on LHD-8, we're stopping work on other ships, that is not the case, we're continuing to make good progress, we're simply having to adjust the deployment of resources. And some to extent accommodate the implications of those workflow changes in the recognition of scheduled progress that we have on some of the ships in the yard.
Wes Bush - President and Chief Operating Officer: Also add in there Cai, if you note from Jim's comments he said that the collateral effect on those other ships, if you will, is about $0.10 this year in our earnings.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company: Okay and then if we think about your win on BAMs and the Tanker, how much is in your 08 estimates for those?
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Cai, we really don't talk about how much is individual programs, our guidance 490 to 515, frankly takes into account the range of possibilities on when Tanker would be turned back on, what the funding levels might be. Obviously, we are under contract on BAMs have received funding and so again that guidance anticipates both of those have events and it essentially accounted for in that range.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company: Okay. The reason I asked is that the Integrated Systems have pretty good revenues $1.340 billion and I guess normally it's knocked [ph] down in a second. But I would assume it would be picking up in the second half, unless I assume they got to do at least 53 that there is going to be opportunities that their could be more of a pick up, is that a fair assumption?
James F. Palmer - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: It really becomes when Tanker when the process is decided and what level of funding is available at that point in time will be key factors on how much work actually gets accomplished this year.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company: Okay, great. And last one, you mentioned I guess winning 2.6 billion of lack or classified awards, and yet, in your release you talked about 688 of restricted program awards in the first quarter. Now could you kind of clarify the difference between those two numbers?
James F. Palmer - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: 688 is last year's classified or restricted awards.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company: Okay. Okay, excuse me. Okay, excellent, thanks.
James F. Palmer - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thank you.
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks Cai.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of Steve Binder. Please proceed, sir with Bear Stearns.
Steve Binder - Bear Stearns: Maybe just touch on Electronic Systems. It looks like a couple head winds in the quarter, government systems and I think naval marine as far as sales being down. Just wondering, is that simply just a timing issue, or is there kind of lifecycle going on there in programs?
James F. Palmer - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Largely timing issues, Steve. A lot of the Electronics businesses we use a units of delivery revenue recognition model. And if you actually look back, you'll see that traditionally revenues are very strong and electronics in the fourth quarter reflecting the buildup of deliveries that occur. And then lighter as we go through time during the quarters, and essentially that's what's happening this quarter as well. The revenues are lighter in terms of those parts of the business that use that units of delivery revenue recognition model.
Steve Binder - Bear Stearns: And Jim, what was your after returns so for in your planned assets year-to-date?
James F. Palmer - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I'm sorry.
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Pension front.
James F. Palmer - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: We are negative for the first quarter about 5% I believe.
Steve Binder - Bear Stearns: And then you touched on the issues in second collections on a quarter was there any customer related issues there at all, do you think it is really just internal?
James F. Palmer - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Largely, there are always questions around timing since our billings are such large dollar amounts whether you get paid now the 31st, first or second of the following month is really important to cash flow. We always have those kinds issues, but largely the issues were the internal conversions to its common accounting system.
Steve Binder - Bear Stearns: And Ron, may be you can just touch on ships and your feelings about the pluses or minuses spinning off that business in the future. I asked that question simply because you put news obviously very... you are familiar with it. It was a very successful spin-off solution and I'm just wondering if you see any merits there?
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. Well first of all, Steve, we remain committed to our ship building business. We see significant opportunities to drive improvements in the business going forward. The fact that we took the step to unify the management structure of these businesses is to provide best practices both up and down from the various locations is I think an evidence of that. We're doing the things we think we need to do to drive performance there. Obviously we got a lot of work ahead of us, however we are committed to that, we see it does fit overall into the portfolio of Northrop substantial platform business the opportunity for other add-ons as a result to that. So, at this point in time I see no change in our direction. We're committed to moving forward. And we think that with the folks who can drive the most value out of this business going forward.
Steve Binder - Bear Stearns: One of the thing that, as far as the restricted work the $2.6 billion is it fair to say that… is that primarily in Space Emission systems or is that kind of long duration kind of business awards?
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Steve, I really unfortunately can’t be more specific about that other than to say that spans number of sectors and a number of different programs.
Steve Binder - Bear Stearns: All right. Thank you.
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Sorry about that.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of Joe Nadol with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed.
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Hello, Joe.
Joseph Nadol - J.P. Morgan: Hello. Good afternoon, good morning. To start with I guess a couple of questions on the Tanker again it's 1.5 billion amount that was added to your backlog and that's how much of that… how was the split between funded and unfunded?
James F. Palmer - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: That 1.5 of total contract value roughly $60 million was funded.
Joseph Nadol - J.P. Morgan: Okay. Okay. And I know that you’ve mentioned that it's all kind of in your guidance for the year in terms of the EPS, but specifically I mean do you, does it matter to your guidance whether it comes in or out or is that just.. at this point 2008 within the range?
James F. Palmer - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes. Well, for 2008 it doesn't matter. Damn, right it matters.
Joseph Nadol - J.P. Morgan: For this year's earnings I mean.
James F. Palmer - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Not so much, but frankly not so much for 2008, but the program is very important to us as we go forward so yes it does matter.
Joseph Nadol - J.P. Morgan: No, of course.
James F. Palmer - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: But frankly for 2008, if there is a small change whether or not it's in or not.
Joseph Nadol - J.P. Morgan: Yes. Okay. And then on the margin, in that segment Intergraded Systems, any better sense as to what the performance improvements were with just key adjustments you raised a number for the year but you are still below where you were in the quarter. Can you give us a better sense there?
James F. Palmer - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, we had. As we do every quarter, we look at individual contracts and their performance. So, we did have some adjustments as frankly everyone does in the industry [ph]. On a go-forward basis, we look at our forecasts for the year, and where I think the business can go. Traditionally, I would tell you that business has been very strong in performance. I know we are spending some unallowable costs on the protests, so I factored that into my thinking as well as I think about their earnings guidance or range of margins for the year. Essentially all of that has been in my thinking at this point in time.
Joseph Nadol - J.P. Morgan: Okay. And then just one final one on the shipbuilding side, the $35 million, am I reading that right, does that includes some other EAC adjustments that were not related to be LHD-8 delay and if that's the case could you give a little color on those?
James F. Palmer - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, it does include some other EAC adjustments and as we mentioned last week when we had our preannouncement, we essentially took at – took a look at the lessons learned all issues that were identified on the LHD-8 and then looked across the portfolio to see whether or not there would be similar type items or related type items on the other programs and considered that in our EACs for them as well.
Joseph Nadol - J.P. Morgan: Okay. So, is it fair to say there were wiring problems elsewhere?
James F. Palmer - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: No, not necessarily wiring problems but just any kind of the rework or schedule extension, those type of items.
Joseph Nadol - J.P. Morgan: Okay. All right. Thank you.
James F. Palmer - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thank you Joe.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of Joe Campbell with Lehman brothers. Please proceed.
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Hello Joe. Joe?
Joe Campbell - Lehman Brothers: Hi, Hi , we had our lines crossed here, good afternoon or good morning. I read in the paper Ron that you and Jim MacClenny [ph] had a meeting with the Air Force and we won't ask too many of the private details. But the sense we had from the public commentary was the suggestion was that the Air Force was an unhappy with the sort of the tone or the argument of tone or the… I don't know what you want to comment about that protest, but I wondered if you just give us any color on what the Air Force is saying about how all this is going on beyond, we're all waiting for the GIO to do their thing?.
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well Joe, first of all I won’t comment on customer meetings. I will tell you that Northrop Grumman has been delighted with the selection we continue to work hard to get ready to build these things, we've totally supported the Air Force’s position. The Air Force of course is not able to say anything at this point of time, because of the rules once protest is in place they have to go silent. And so, all I can say is that we're anxiously awaiting the successful resolution of protest get ready to those Tankers.
Joe Campbell - Lehman Brothers: Terrific.
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks Joe.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of Howard Rubel with Jeffries & Co. Please proceed.
Howard Rube - Jeffries & Co: Thank you very much. Couple of things. One is the EO business that you sold, it looks like it wasn't making very… in fact it was credit loss money last year?
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: You are right.
Howard Rube - Jeffries & Co: And this year breakeven. So, I mean that probably has what half of the reasons why you improved guidance in the segment on margin basis is that fair?
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Really it's just looking hear… because that business was being sold we were ready to fact out with the discontinued operations their margin. And so we were looking at the margins on the rest of the business and that's our thought process around the change in margins. It's really the improvements in the business ex the U.S. piece of business.
Howard Rube - Jeffries & Co: Part of any risk… thank you. Part of… that's pretty fair. So part of any discussion with the Navy is when you reschedule the discussion with the Navy, what kind of feedback have you got from them, help that and how support have they did with this change?
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well, let me take a cut at that. First of all, we're working very closely with the Navy. And I think that while we're not happy with the delay, and they're certainly not happy with the delay, the working relationship is very strong, not only on this ship but across the other ships, we have a common objective here, which is to get good ships to them as fast as we can. They're our partners in this; they have several hundred people working in the ship shipyards with us, shoulder to shoulder. This is a joint responsibility in some ways. Certainly we take responsibility for our part of this thing. I would say the relationship is very positive and strong going forward. And we're on the same page.
Howard Rube - Jeffries & Co: I've appreciate that one. And the last thing is steel prices have gone up substantially recently in kind of we all are seeing a little bit of inflationary pressures. What do you do I mean are you seeing any of that as it affects your business and what are you doing to mitigate it?
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well, Howard, obviously steel price is a component of our total cost, but I'll will tell you that labor and labor efficiency Labor quality, quality processes tend to be more important to us than the actual raw cost of the steel. By the way these ships have lots of electronic and machinery content as well. So while steel prices going up is not a positive thing it doesn't move the needle quite as much as our ability to improve our efficiencies and processes.
Howard Rube - Jeffries & Co: Okay. Thanks.
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Howard.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of George Shapiro with Citigroup. Please proceed.
George Shapiro - Citigroup: Good morning or afternoon.
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, George.
George Shapiro - Citigroup: If I look at Electronics, it seems like the guidance for revenues you are left the same despite selling effectively nearly $200 million. So what implies it for year-over-year electronic sales are going to be up close to 9%, but the first quarter is up only 2%. So can you tell us what's going to accelerate or help the back-end to get to the 9% and I used the midpoint $7.1 billion to calculate?
James F. Palmer - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: George, as I mentioned earlier we traditionally have higher unit deliveries in the later part of the year in the Electronics business, a significant part of the Electronics business uses the units of delivery method for revenue recognition. So, if you look back on a number of years or quarters, you'll find that traditionally they have or revenue growth in the first part of the year and stronger revenue growth in the later part of the year essentially reflecting that volume of increased unit of deliveries in the second part of the year… second half of the year.
George Shapiro - Citigroup: But why isn't that just a seasonal issue, so why, why does it mean that you should see accelerating year-over-year increases?
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well, they been winning lot of business George, if you look at our backlog – their the backlog.
Wes Bush - President and Chief Operating Officer: Scheduled five of our release, George has a nice profile of the total backlog and if you take a look at their performance in electronics year-over-year, you can see a tremendous growth in their backlog and this is the manifestation of that successful business capture.
George Shapiro - Citigroup: So you are figuring your capture in additional $200 million in revenues because you didn't lower the revenue guidance for the adjustment of the sale of electro optics?
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, exactly.
George Shapiro - Citigroup: Okay. And the same question in ship building, it doesn't look like you lowered the revenues there except you commented that you had $134 million hit to revenues in the quarter because of the charge and at the Gulf shipyards you probably going to have less revenues because of your adjusted EICs. So is that just meaning you are getting more business from Newport News?
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Not necessarily more business from the Newport News, but and obviously part of that $134 million setback will be now recognized in the remaining part of this year, so as I alluded to earlier, I feel good about our revenue forecast for shipbuilding at this point in time.
George Shapiro - Citigroup: Okay. And the drop in margin that you're saying whether rest of the year will be about 8.5% versus 10%, is that just reflecting the lower-margin at the Gulf shipyards and Newport News is going to be comparable to what it was in the first quarter, or there is something going on there as well?
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: First of all, the guidance for shipbuilding for the year was lower 9% if I remember correctly. So as we go forward essentially it is… performance of both shipyards on a go-forward basis for the programs that they have.
George Shapiro - Citigroup: No, what am I asking Jim is I mean, we know that Gulf shipyards are going to be lower because of the $36 million adjustments that you made. I'm just wondering whether Newport News is also going to be lower for some other unknown reasons?
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Nothing I know of.
George Shapiro - Citigroup: So it is really just going to be the Gulf shipyards? Okay. And then one last one, the aerospace margin always tends to do better than what you think it's going to do, but to get from 12.7% in the first quarter to the range that you given requires a fairly substantial step down in subsequent quarters and it doesn't look like there were one-time items in quarter. So I was just wondering what may cause that to occur.
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Part of it is the new programs, which we traditionally start out at lower earnings rates to begin with. And frankly, as I commented to one of the earlier questions we did have some Q1 catch-up adjustments in this business, in this quarter. It's hard for me to project whether I'm going to have any further team catch-up adjustments because I'd knew about them, I should be recognizing them now, right.
George Shapiro - Citigroup: Right. Correct.
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: To your point there had been strong performers, I alluded to that as well. But the guidance at this point reflects what I know about their business, including the cost that we're incurring on the protest on allowable cost. And so, when I think about their margins and their performance, they have been strong performers, I expect them to continue to be strong performers. We are adding some volume with a new development contracts with lower revenue, lower-margins at the beginning, and then we have protest costs as well that we're incurring.
George Shapiro - Citigroup: Then would it be fair to... I don't think you really... you said how much the catch-up's were. Would it be fair to say that cum [ph] catch-ups in the quarter were the bulk of the difference between your expected margin for the year and what you reported?
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: That's part of it, yes.
George Shapiro - Citigroup: Okay. That's my questions. Thanks.
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Okay. Thanks, George.
Wes Bush - President and Chief Operating Officer: Cut the questions of now, we are running out of time now Ron.
Ronald D. Sugar - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. Let me just make a final remark. First of all, as we told you last week and this week and as Wes has delineated in some detail, we are taking action on LHD-8. We will emerge stronger from this situation than we did before. We see significant opportunity for improvement of the ship building business. The reminder of the company is clicking on all cylinders, and we continue to be extremely confident about the future of this company. So, thank you all for joining us this morning, and we'll talk to you next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining… participating in the Northrop Grumman's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. This concludes your presentation, and you may now disconnect. Have a good day.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to Northrop Grumman Fourth Quarter and Year-End Results Conference Call. My name is Lauren and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session at the conclusion of this presentation. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today’s call, Mr. Gaston Kent Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, please proceed.
Gaston Kent - Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations: Thanks Lauren. And good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to Northrop Grumman’s fourth quarter 2007 conference call. We provided supplemental information in the form of a PowerPoint presentation that you can access on our investor relations website at northropgrumman.com. The presentation will be available for a limited time and should be viewed in conjunction with today’s commentary. Before we start please understand that as shown on slide two some of the matters discussed on this call constitutes forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements reflect the Company’s views with respect to future events and prospective financial performance. Forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties and the actual results the Company may differ materially from the results expressed or implied by the forward looking statements. More complete expression of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the Company’s SEC Filings including Forms 10-K and 10-Q. During the call, we will discuss fourth quarter and full year results including the non-GAAP measures, segment operating margins and free cash flow, both of which are reconciled in our press release. During today’s call, we will also discuss our outlook for 2008. Guidance will also include GAAP measures of sales, operating margin, earnings per share from continuing operation, cash from operations and non-GAAP measures, total segment operating margin and free cash flow. Just to advise you there is an updated release which will go out shortly correcting a transposition on schedule one of the release. In that schedule net income is shown as $1 billion or $1.709 billion, the correct number as is displayed actually in the release is $1.790 billion. It’s a simple transposition of those numbers. The 8-K filing which went to the SEC this morning is correct. I also want to draw your attention to schedule 6 of our earnings release which provides an adjustment of 2005 through 2007 results reflecting the transfer of a small organization from electronic systems to mission systems which became effective January 1. Schedule 6 is provided so you test your modules prior to the first quarter. On the call today are our Chairman and CEO Ron Sugar, our President and CEO, Wes Bush and our Chief Financial Officer, Jim Palmer. Please go now to slide three and at this time I would now like to turn the call over to Ron.
Ronald D. Sugar - Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you Gaston. Hello everyone and thanks for joining to discuss our fourth quarter and full year results. This is an outstanding finish to 2007 which was a record year by every key measure. Sales topped $32 billion, segment operating margin increased to 11% to $3.1 billion or 9.7% of sales. Operating margin grew 22% to more than $3 billion and EPS rose 16% to $5.16 per share. Cash from operations reached a record $2.9 billion with free cash flow exceeding $2 billion. We also increased our total backlog by $3 billion to an annual record of $64.1 billion. We continue to build on and strengthen the positive trends we have demonstrated over the last several years. To put this year’s results into perspective, since 2003 the full first full year following our last major acquisition, operating margin has more than doubled. Operating margin rate has expanded 360 basis points from 5.8% to 9.4%. Earnings per share have increased by nearly 250% and cash from operations has more than doubled. We continued to deliver on our commitment to improve performance. The strength of our financial results allowed us to take several shareholder value enhancing actions during 2007. We increased the dividend by 23%, the fourth double digit increase in as many years and then an 85% increase since 2003. We repurchased $15.5 million shares of our common stock for $1.2 billion during the year. Our board recently authorized a new $2.5 billion share repurchase agreement, our largest till date, representing approximately 9% of our shares outstanding. During the year, we also invested for the future with acquisitions of Essex Corporation, which has enhanced our capabilities and participation in the rapidly growing intelligence business, as well as acquisitions of Scaled Composites and Xinetics. Along with executing our balance cash deployment strategy, we improved our net debt to total capital ratio to 14% achieving the highest credit rating in our Company’s history. One of the highlights during 2007 was new business capture. New awards totaled $34.8 billion. We are specially encouraged by several trends we saw in 2007. First our technology continues to be a competitive discriminator. We saw this in both our core markets, as well as adjacent markets and with new and non-traditional customers. We won competitions for Navy UAS, GPS operational control system, Ground/Air Task Order Radar called G/ATOR, and the CREW 3 Counter IED contract. We were awarded a U.S. postal service contract to further automate mail handling, and we were also selected to outfit Marine Core’s CH-53E helicopters with our DIRCM missile defense system. DIRCM Technology also advanced in the commercial arena, where testing is now underway on Fed Ex aircraft. Secondly, during the year we were also awarded several contracts that mark the beginning of what promises to be a very long set of product runs for programs like the E-2D Advanced Hawkeye and the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. These are both franchised programs that should provide profitable revenue for decades. We were also awarded funding for the next lot of global Hawkeye, and large contracts for construction of the LHA 6 big deck and a 9 LPD assault ship. And early this year, we received the next increment of design and advanced construction funding for the first Gerald Ford class aircraft carrier CVN 78. We also saw an upturn in international business that was very encouraging. Examples here are the year Hawkeye award and the MESA radar for Korea. Electronics, where most of our international business resides had record acquisitions in 2007, which approximately 25% is international and foreign military sales. In additional to traditional sales of electronics, we are also seeing substantial international opportunities for security and infrastructure protection, such as the United Kingdoms IDENT 1 program. Lastly, we’ve been very successful across the corporation in wining competitions in the intelligence and restricted arenas. We continue to pursue $10’s of billion of competitive new business opportunities. We’ve discussed many of these outside opportunities with you in the past, such as the air force, aerial refueling tanker and the BAMS. But two important new opportunities I would like to mention today are the army’s aerial common sensor restart and the army marine core Joint Light Tactical Vehicle program, which we are doing in partnership with Oshkosh Truck. On JLTV Northrop Grumman brings rich experience in the design, development and systems integration of conflex mission equipment on military platforms. Our partner Oshkosh Trucks brings unparallel ability in advanced, extreme duty vehicle systems. This combination will enable our team to deliver the best JLTV solutions to our nation's war fighters. In summary, 2007 was a very good year for Northrop Grumman and for our shareholders. We captured business in new and adjacent markets, grew sales, improved performance, executed our balance cash deployment strategy, and announced several organizational realignments designed to position the Company for the future. We also announced some changes in our senior management. Scott Seymour and Jerry Agee will be retiring from Northrop Grumman this year. Gary Ervin will Head Integrated Systems and Phil Teel will be taking the helm at Mission Systems. I want to thank both Scott and Jerry for their contributions to Northrop Grumman over the years. I also want to acknowledge the outstanding job Phil Teel did in leading ship systems, and his work on the recovery from Hurricane Katrina. Ship building is moving in the right direction. Mike Petters will now take over as we combine new port news and ship systems into one business, which we will call ship building. Our rich bench of leadership talent will enable a seamless transition into this new structure across the Company. You will meet these terrific executives in their new roles at our upcoming investor conference on February 26th. In looking at the year, we are pleased with our progress and we will continue to focus on improving opportunities going forward. We continue to be contained, keenly focused on growing our sales, expanding margins, increasing EPS and further improving cash performance. Looking ahead, we expect the positive trends of the just concluded year to continue in 2008. Our $64 billion backlog gives us a solid base for growth. In 2008, we expect sales of approximately $33 billion, earnings per share of between $5.50 and $5.75 a share with cash from operations of $2.8 billion to $3.1 billion, and free cash flow of $1.9 billion to $2.3 billion. We had a terrific year in 2007 and 2008; it’s shaping up to be even better. Now, I’d like to turn the call over to Wes Bush for additional discussion on Northrop Grumman’s operations. Wes?
Wesley G. Bush - President and Chief Operating Officer: Thanks Ron, hello everyone. My comments are outlined on slide four. From operational perspective 2007 was a year of solid improvement in program, performance and significant risk reduction. From a risk reduction perspective, several challenging programs have shown marked improvement and good progress towards completion. For example, we completed the restructure of the NPOESS contract and all pre-Katrina contracts and ships, which represent several billion dollars of our contract base. We also settled two legal matters with Cogent and Goodrich. We successfully completed critical scheduled milestones on Box-60, with all hardware delivered and performing well in concrete. We are continuing to make good progress on the Falcon Edge Software, and we expect to retire that technical risk over the course of this year. On Wedgetail, we are also making good progress. We are currently completing the development phase and transition into type acceptance testing later this quarter or early next quarter. The technical risk is retired with a combination of that testing, presently anticipated in the third quarter. And lastly on LHD8, we are continuing to make progress towards our scheduled year and delivery date. I also want to provide a little more background on our recently announced organizational changes. Our primary goals and realignments are enhance support to our customers, better utilization of capabilities and resources, and of course operating improvements. Our customers including the Navy have expressed their strong support for these realignments. The combination of our Gulf Coast operations with new port news, will further enhance our world class ship building enterprise, and provide an integrated inter phase and four range of capabilities to our customers. We will be able to more efficiently utilize our assets, deploy our ship builders and invest for the future to meet our customer’s needs. We do not anticipate any facility closures, or significant reductions in your employment levels, as a result of this realignment. In fact, we continue to be in a having mode in many of our ship building locations. We do expect cost savings to result from the realignment overtime. We also announced our missiles business with approximately $900 million in revenue, will now report as a part of space technology. This comprises our ICBM and KEI programs, as well as our missile engineering center, and it is an excellent fit with our space technologies customers and its advanced technology profile. This transfer will enhance our companies overall support to our air force and our missile defense customers, and it will optimize our capabilities and resources. Missile systems focus will be on our rapidly growing C4ISR business. Now, this change will be effective July 1st, so you won’t see it reflected in our financials until we report our third quarter results later in October. We are also focused on improving our performance by strengthening program management over side and processes, increasing our discipline around bid and contract negotiations with strengthen threshold criteria, and of course driving cost competitiveness through process improvements. A good example of this is our recently established enterprise shared services organization, whose target is to deliver high quality enterprise wide services to our sectors at very competitive costs. These efforts will produce continuing improvements throughout the Company. And with that, I’ll turn the call over to Jim for more detailed discussion of our financials.
James F. Palmer -Chief Financial Officer: Thanks Wes, and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. My comments begin on slide five and they will summarize fourth quarter and 2007 results, as well as 2008 guidance. The highlights for the quarter and for the year were sales growth, margin expansion both in dollars and in rate, earnings per share growth and record cash performance. As a result of our very strong performance, we exceeded our guidance for sales, EPS, cash from operations and free cash flow. For 2007, we have improved by every measure. Sales were up 6%, segment operating margin is up 40 basis points to 9.7%, total operating margin rate is up a 120 basis points to 9.4%. Cash from operations reached a record $2.9 billion even after the $200 million of discretionary pre-funding of our pension plan in the fourth quarter. And free cash flow topped $2 billion, a record for the Company and an impressive of 116% conversion of net income. Now moving to slide six, the businesses combined for a 10% increase and sales for the quarter, and a 6% increase for the year. All four businesses post a higher fourth quarter sales. Information and services rose 11%, ships increased 19% and electronics rose 8%. For the year, electronic and services is 11%, ships is up 9% and electronics is up 6%. These increases were more than offset by the – these increases more than offset the 3% year-over-year sales decline for aerospace. The trends driving the fourth quarter and full year sales are consistent with the results for the first three quarters. For information and services, the drivers are, the large state and local programs we won in 2006, the Essex acquisition, new program wins, an additional revenue from existing intelligence programs, and then the Nevada test site programs. We had a small increase in Aerospace this quarter, due to higher volumes for restricted and several space programs. This was more than offset by the expected downturn in integrated systems revenues, as large programs like the E-2D Advanced Hawkeye, the F-35 and the EA-18 Growler transition from development to production. Our electronics business continues to see a strong demand for electro optical and infrared countermeasure products, including the inaugural DIRCM contract with the marines. Electronics is also seeing growth in communications in ISR, along with additional volume for restricted business. Higher sales for ships reflects the recovery from hurricane Katrina. Ramp up on LPD and LHA programs, the inclusion of revenue from AMSEC and higher volume for Coast Guard, aircraft carrier and submarine programs. Moving on to slide seven, segment operating margin rose 15% for the quarter and 11% for the year, and for both periods margin rate expanded by 40 basis points. All four businesses post a double digit operating margin increases in the fourth quarter. And for the year, operating margin is up 37% for ships, 8% for our electronics, 75 for aerospace, and 3% for information services. Looking at the fourth quarter and full year trends, aerospace electronics and ships operating margin rates are generally in line with what we discussed, as our fourth quarter expectations in our last quarterly earnings call. Aerospace operating margin is 100 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2006 at 9.7%. For the year, aerospace operating margin rate expanded 60 basis – 90 basis points to 10.4%. These increases are primarily driven by improved results and innovative systems. Electronics margin rate for the fourth quarter expanded 85 basis points to 12.1%, and for the year expanded 25 basis points. For the year, information services came at 8% in line with guidance, but the fourth quarter operating margin and rate are lower than I expected. Information technology fourth quarter margin and margin rate reflect a higher percentage of lower margin state and local business. In addition, IT’s fourth quarter margins were also negatively effected by about a 120 basis points, due to final allocation of state income taxes among the sectors and year-end cost accruals. Without those items IT’s fourth quarter performance would have been in line with expectations. For the Company, we expand our total operating margin rate by 80 basis points for the quarter and a 120 basis points for the year. Total operating margin increased $137 million, or 22% for the quarter, and $542 million also 22% for the, for the year. The improvements for the quarter and year-to-date review the better performance by all four businesses and lower net pension expense. Results for the year also include lower unallocated corporate expenses, primarily legal provisions. Our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 34.6% compared with 33.6% in last years fourth quarter. For the year, our effective tax rate is 32.9% versus 31.2% in 2006. Slide eight provides a revised format for our reconciliation of net income to cash from operations, and free cash flow for the quarter and year-to-date. This new format summarizes non-cash items like the depreciation and amortization, stock based compensation and deferred taxes into a single line and highlight trade working capital. For the fourth quarter, including the $200 million discretionary pension pre-funding, cash from operations was $734 million. Capital spending was slightly higher than last year, bringing us the free cash flow of $432 million for the quarter. For the year, major items driving the strong cash performance or higher net income and non-cash items reduced pension funding and improved trade working capital. We’ve been very focused on working capital improvements, which is reflected in our 2007 results. For the year, we’ve reduced trade working capital by a $142 million, despite a $1.9 billion increase in sales. Capital spending for the year totaled $685 million and outsourcing contract and software related costs are $137 million, bringing us the free cash flow of $2.1 billion and improvement of the $1 billion over 2006, and a 116% conversion in net income. Now, lets move on to 2008 guidance. Actuals for 2007 and our guidance for 2008 are depicted on slide nine. But I want to provide some perspective on how I view the fundamental trends year-over-year. We expect 2008 sales of about $33 billion, a slightly more than a 3% growth. This estimate is for organic growth only, and we could see some upside to this number depending on timing and funding profiles for several new competitive programs, which were scheduled to be awarded this year. Segment operating margin rate is expected to be in the mid to high 9% range compared with 9.7% in 2007. In comparing to 2007, keep in mind that our 2007 rate included a net positive impact of approximately 20 basis points for items such as the Katrina insurance recovery, AMSEC gain and completion of contract negotiations with customers, offset somewhat by a negative earnings adjustment on LHDA in the second quarter. So adjusting for the net impact of these special items 2008 does call for continued performance improvement and margin rate expansion for our operations. Operating margin should improve to high 9% range, as result of lower pension expense and somewhat lower corporate unallocated expenses. For our EPS, we expect a range of $5.50 to $5.75. This 7% to 11% improvement over 2007, reported results will be driven by higher sales and higher operating margin. The EPS range assumes an effective tax rate of about 34% and a 2% reduction from 2007, weighted average share is outstanding through open market share repurchases. Turning to cash for 2008, we expect cash from operations to be in the range of $2.8 billion, $3.1 billion, which reflects growth generally in line with that of net income. Free cash flow is projected to range between $1.9 billion to $2.3 billion, which should translate again to a net income conversion of a 100% or better. We will be providing more detail on trends we expect in our business segments at our investor conference on February 26th. In summary, it was a very strong quarter and we crossed the finished line with record results and solid foundation going in to 2008. Gaston with that I’m ready to turn the call back over to you for Q&A.
Gaston Kent - Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations: Thanks Jim. Lauren, we are ready for questions now. And ladies and gentlemen, before we start, let me ask you would limit yourself to one question as you work or wait through the queue. Lauren? Question and Answer
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from the line of Robert Springer with Credit Suisse.
Robert Springer - Credit Suisse: Good afternoon everyone.
Ronald D. Sugar - Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Robert.
Robert Springer - Credit Suisse: Yes, could you give us a little bit more color on your ’08 guidance behind the segment level?
James F. Palmer -Chief Financial Officer: Segment level guidance, is that what I have heard the question to be Robert?
Robert Springer - Credit Suisse: Yes.
James F. Palmer -Chief Financial Officer: And you are looking for sales their margins or?
Robert Springer - Credit Suisse: Well, I mean sales margins, just directional commentary to the extent that you can offer that, you know above and beyond what you’ve got here on slide nine?
James F. Palmer -Chief Financial Officer: Sure. Let me walk through the… both sales and margin rates as I see them. I do see sales growth essentially in information and services, aerospace and electronic systems. Ships revenues I think are the fairly constant year-over-year. In terms of margin rate, I expect information and services that kind of be in the low 9% range, aerospace ought to b e in the mid 9% or so, electronic 12% - 12% plus type range, and I think ships will be in the low 9% range.
Robert Springer - Credit Suisse: Okay, then on your free cash. The mid point on your guidance there implies a slight erosion in what was exceptional performance this year. I know you said a 100% or better, but you were at one point too. Could you talk about what needs to happen to maintain that 1.2%?
James F. Palmer -Chief Financial Officer: Essentially, being at the top end of the guidance range on free cash flow would, would get us that kind of conversion rates again.
Robert Springer - Credit Suisse: And is that all just in working capital or is there some movement in the CapEx plan?
James F. Palmer -Chief Financial Officer: No just you know it’s… Robert, I think the best way to describe it is -- we are at the very beginning of the year. I think there are opportunities, but you know and we -- as I have mentioned in the past, we are driving on working capital. We’ve made good progress, we are not finished. I think there are additional opportunities and it’s up to us to bring those home.
Robert Springer - Credit Suisse: Thank you very much.
James F. Palmer -Chief Financial Officer: Thank you Rob.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Steve Binder with Bear Stearns.
Steve Binder - Bear Stearns: Jim just a follow up. What’s your assumption for FCAS, you know in 2008 over ’07?
James F. Palmer -Chief Financial Officer: That’s about a $100 million improvement Steve in our net pension expense driven essentially by three items. Our discount rate is going to move from 6 to 6 in a quarter. We did have really good investment performance in the, in the plans this year. Above 8.5% long term rate return of assumption, where actual investment performance as a little bit above 11%, some very strong performance in a trophy market. And then thirdly the $200 million of pension pre-funding that we made in the fourth quarter also has a positive impact on that change in pension cost year-over-year.
Steve Binder - Bear Stearns: Okay. And then in the -- in space technology, you are the best sales increases that we’ve seen in the long, long time. In fact for many years, I’m not even sure. When was the last time that was repeated in the -- you noticed the restricted activity picking up in the quarter. Is that a -- is that a trend that we should see sustain in 2008. I’m not telling 14% growth, but is the growth in, in classified activity; can it continue in ’08, can we see strong growth out in space technology?
James F. Palmer -Chief Financial Officer: Steve, across the board we’ve seen increased restricted activities.
Steve Binder - Bear Stearns: All right. Thanks a lot.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.
Cai Von Rumohr - SG Cowen Securities: Yes, general corporate unallocated $224 million. How big was the check you wrote to Goodrich in the fourth quarter? And where you know, you said it only down slightly, but you had a couple of large abnormal negatives in ’07. I would think it would be down towards the 140 level, is that being too aggressive and if so why?
Ronald D. Sugar - Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well, you are partly right, Cai, we did write the check and settled with Goodrich late in the fourth quarter. Frankly from a quarterly impact it was insignificant, the bigger driver and corporate unallocated for the year is essentially the second quarter provision we made for a number of various legal items. There were some adjustments of legal items in the fourth quarter as well but it was by far not nearly the size of the second quarter adjustment in terms of corporate unallocated going forward I kind of look for about a $25 million or so decrease over the 2007 level.
Cai Von Rumohr - SG Cowen Securities: Okay. How come only so small given that these are all relatively large items you have?
Ronald D. Sugar - Executive Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: Just when I look at the trends, that’s kind of where I think we could be for the year.
Cai Von Rumohr - SG Cowen Securities: Okay. Great. Thanks so much.
Ronald D. Sugar - Executive Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: Okay.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS.
David Strauss - UBS: Good afternoon. Good morning. You talked about shifts, Jim flat in 2008. Could you just give a little more color around that. Obviously you had the strike impact in ’07, you are still operating… running a pretty low rate in the first and second quarters. I am just a little surprised you wouldn’t see a little bit of growth in that business in ’08?
James R. O’Neill - Corporate Vice President and President, Information Technology: I essentially see a little bit of growth, but I don’t know that it is not enough… it’s not the 4% number that I talked about for your information, for example, for your information and services. So there is a little bit of growth but it’s not a whole lot.
Ronald D. Sugar - Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, David, this is Ron. We have a variety of programs which are finishing up and we have a few others that are getting started and so I think its just basically a timing and a mix thing as we go through the cycle of destroyers and amphibs, large decks and what have you.
David Strauss - UBS: And to follow up Ron, can you maybe talk about longer term what do you see for the ship building business, you are partner on Virginia Class Submarine, laid out a pretty, pretty strong growth profile over the next couple of years personally driven by second sub of year. So just thinking about a little bit longer term what do you see for the business?
Ronald D. Sugar - Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well, we see a solid business going forward. We believe that the Navy will move to Virginia class per year in 2011 and probably that gives us some more ahead of time. As you know we are partners with Joe Dynamics, we are their sub-contractor and so while we set the work, our revenue is only that piece which we have. We also see the DDX program picking up but we will also have some tailing off of the DDG51 Destroyer line which has been a tremendous line for us in the next couple of years. We do see a steady production of aircraft carriers going forward and in fact the Navy has put a couple of carriers in their palm, I believe they are four year centers and this is of course the Gerald Ford class and in CVN-78 class. So I think overall I think we see a solid business, to echo Jim, I don’t think we see a dramatic up-spike in revenues but we do see a solid business and I think the story in ships is driving the performance levels both in terms of margins and cash a year over year better than a couple of years.
David Strauss - UBS: Thanks a lot.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Doug Hoenig with Sanford Bernstein.
Doug Hoenig - Sanford Bernstein: Good morning.
Ronald D. Sugar - Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, Doug.
Doug Hoenig - Sanford Bernstein: I am interested in the real line in ship building and I know really for the last three years you have talked a lot about taking lessons learnt from Newport News and using that as in the Gulf Shipyards. What’s led you to the decision to do this re-alignment now and what levels do you expect to use to improve performance there?
Ronald D. Sugar - Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well, Doug, this is something we have considered since we made the acquisition of Newport News quite a number of years ago. The difficulty was that initially Newport News had some issues in terms of delivering carriers and what have you and then unfortunately as we got to the place where we are in good shape there we had Katrina hit us, which really was a devastating impact a couple of years ago and we felt that managerially we were much better off to focus on those two businesses with two very powerful executives, running those businesses, collaborating but running those businesses in parallel. We are now at a position where from a performance standpoint and recovery and regeneration standpoint in the Gulf, we can and we have announced the unification of businesses in terms of a single sector management team. We have in fact increasingly been working on moving best practices, capabilities both ways, by the way, not just from new partnerships but also the other way around. We think that putting a common management in place we will be able to accelerate that. But more importantly, we will be to probably more agilely operate in terms of managing workflow peaks and valleys in each of those yards. It turns out as you look forward in ’08, ’09, ‘010, you do see some variations in manpower requirements in those yards and manpower’s actually crucial because they are the skilled people that we need to go to the ships. In some cases we have a demand for manpower in one of the yards and we have shortfall of work in the other. So we have the opportunity probably more agilely move the work back and forth as we need to. As Wes indicated we do plan to continue hiring, we have some strengths that are going forward in both areas and so we just think that we are going have a more efficient operational for it. I would also finally mention that it simplifies the interface with the Navy at the highest levels because now we have a single executive in charge of ship building business.
Doug Hoenig - Sanford Bernstein: And as part of this, one of the things that I understood of Katrina that you wanted to do in the Gulf was entry was quite a bit more automation and in fact news, news of the Katrina situation that we had a catalyst to start with a clean sheet of paper and do things somewhat differently. Assuming that’s the case, can you comment on how things have progressed in terms of automating things more and also will this re-alignment help in there?
Ronald D. Sugar - Executive Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: Yes, Doug. We have made substantial progress there. Let me ask Wes to give you a couple more pieces of color on that.
Wesley G. Bush - President and Chief Operating Officer: Yes. If you look at what we have done in the Gulf since Katrina, we did use this as an opportunity to retool our operations there. We defined the process for the workflow, we redefined the way in which the work actually gets done, introduced new technology such as wireless technology into the shipyard to help facilitate the flow of inventory and the application of labor in a more efficient way. So there are a lot of things that we have taken on that are going extremely well and I give the team in the Gulf, an enormous amount of credit for not only recovering from Katrina, but figuring out how to use that opportunity to step us ahead. So as Ron indicated we have an opportunity to bring a lot of best practices from Newport News to the Gulf and we have a lot of opportunity to bring not only longer term best practices but some more current, more recent ways of managing the workflow to Newport News. We see the coming together of these two businesses as an important step in what we are working to achieve over the longer term of having a integrated shipbuilding enterprise that gives us that flexibility to deal with how we are getting the work done and how we are best satisfying the Navy’s demands as their demands change over time so this very best move is a step forward.
Doug Hoenig - Sanford Bernstein: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol with JP Morgan.
Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan: Thanks. Good morning.
Ronald D. Sugar - Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning Joe.
Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan: I would like to ask you about state and local part of your IT business. I am wondering I guess first of all what’s the contract structure generally on those programs, is it fixed price or is it timed materials et cetera and is this intrinsically a lower margin business or are these big long term contracts where you are initially taking a more conservative booking rate and seeing how things go, maybe if you could help out a little bit with that?
Ronald D. Sugar - Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes Joe. They are long term contracts up to 10 years in some cases, a mix of fixed price and time and material type activities. The activities over the last year have largely been more of a transition activity as opposed to a service, true service delivery if you will. So, we are seeing the very front end of these long contracts moving or transitioning the work from the prior provider to ourselves and as we go into ’08 we will be essentially moving out of that transition phase into a more service delivery type of phase.
Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan: Could you characterize after the fixed priced portions of or the fixed price contracts specifically. Is there sort of risk reduction as you go in and foresee what has been done and is that a risk and B, is that potential reward as you hit those milestones you are able to increase the accrual rates?
Ronald D. Sugar - Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: All of that would be true and essentially with long term contracts and particularly IT long term contracts, there is always changes that occur whether it’s in the hardware or software applications. All of those are essential opportunities for further revenue growth and margin opportunity.
Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan: Just can you say when you hit some of the major milestones this year?
Ronald D. Sugar - Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Essentially we transitioned San Diego at the end of the year and we will finish transitioning Vida kind of mid-year of ’08.
Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Heidi Wood with Morgan Stanley.
Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley: Good morning. Ron, can you talk to us about, help us better understand DOD’s newly announced policy of requesting multiple prototypes on major acquisition programs? How does that affect Northrop’s business going forward?
Ronald D. Sugar - Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well, Heidi, I will give you… first of all I think its an interesting policy, its probably a very good policy, Secretary Young has obviously put that in place. The challenge is that you need a little upfront money to carry three guys instead of two, on the other hand these are very, very big weapons systems decisions, they have 30/40 year lifecycles. So, it is important to get them right in the beginning. We think this is great. Obviously it gives us an opportunity to participate and show what we can do and we would much rather win a program as a result of having the best offering as opposed to maybe writing the previous proposal. One example I can give you is the joint light tactical vehicle program which we did just recently announce our participation with Oshkosh, that’s a huge program, that could be a $50 billion program over the next several decades, it will replace all the Humvees in the inventory. We think that the opportunity to demonstrate what we can do through a prototype period is an excellent idea and by the way, the contractors will learn from the government what they really want and the government will have a much better understanding of what it really needs to buy as it clarifies its sense of requirements, it has the benefit of competition. So I think that’s a good idea and there will be other examples of that going forward and obviously as the contractor will be, we will participate as the government wants us to.
Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley: And do you see concern about this being funded on the contractor’s coin initially or does it look like they are prepared to fund those?
Ronald D. Sugar - Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I think in general, Heidi, these will be funded by the government. Of course there will be opportunities for the Company to invest some research money if they were appropriate but I don’t think we are back to the days, if you remember back in the old airplane competitions with the A12 and others, where companies were basically betting themselves, betting the farm on whether or not they would win the program. I don’t think we are going to see that. I think certainly the industry would find that fairly unappealing and those of us who are running these companies will obviously have to make our own decisions but I think we are looking at a case of generally funded prototypes.
Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley: Hi and lastly, you have talked a lot about the efficiency that you are making in the Gulf and obviously it looks like they procurement bow wave and shipbuilding is finally on us. When, when you look going forward, when do you think you can get to 10% margins in ships?
Wesley G. Bush - President and Chief Operating Officer: I think over the next few years, is obviously we have to work our way through the inventory of ships that are already under contract, that we are working through what have euphemously called the pig and the snake in terms of the Katrina affected ships and we are working those through the system. So I would say within a few years we should be able to move in that direction and we are absolutely focused on moving the efficiency and the profitability of this business to a place where we think it should be or you think it should be and if you take a look at the progress we have made to date in the last few years despite the impacts of the Katrina, despite the impacts of the strike, I think you can see we have got a heck of a trend going.
Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley: Great. Thanks very much.
Wesley G. Bush - President and Chief Operating Officer: Thanks Heidi.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Joe Campbell with Lehman Brothers.
Joseph Campbell - Lehman Brothers: Good morning. I would like to stay with ships if I can, I have sort of two things I don’t understand. Nick Chubraya was talking about his shipbuilding business sort of being catching, is about $500 million less than you in catching up to you this year and then growing 40% over the next three years that follow. So I am trying to understand whether there is a shift in the mix between the nation’s two shipbuilding programs where Judie’s winning and you guys are losing or whether you are just being more reticent about what you see going on. The second aspect of the shipbuilding thing that I don’t quite understand and maybe you can help me with this, just the sort of traditionally Newport News is an all cost plus known as a very expensive shipyard that builds very complicated nuclear power ships. And the Pascagoula Yards have been known as people that build fixed price ships and always have to compete and I just sort of, don’t understand how after all these years it will make sense to have the guy that normally is not that attentive to cost, run the shipyard that needs to be attentive to cost?
Ronald D. Sugar - Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well Joe, you have asked a number of questions and made a number of assertions whether you may needed to take it one at a time. First of all, I can’t really speak to Nick Chubraya’s forecast for ship building; you have to ask him about that. I am not aware of winning or losing, we are both building DDX’s together in partnership, we are both going to be building Virginia classes together in partnership. We have significant work coming in aircraft carriers. We have significant work in amphibious assault ships including the LPD line and the LHA6 newly awarded. We are not participating in LCS and we are not participating in bulk carriers such as TAKE’s, we are not participating in oil tankers or crew carriers and that sort of thing. So to that extent there might be some difference in the mix. But the things that I am aware of, we certainly know our plan going forward, it’s a matter of public record with the Navy. We are obviously partnered with the GD on subs we worked together on those. So I am not aware of GD winning and Northrop losing. In fact, quite frankly we find ourselves cooperating across the board on almost everything now as directed by the Navy. So that’s going very well. With respect to your…
Joseph Campbell - Lehman Brothers: So Ron, does that mean that we should expect very strong growth in ships. I mean Nick said this is the strongest part of the entire GD portfolio?
Ronald D. Sugar - Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I think that’s great and I am not predicting that at Northrop. What we are telling is that we see steady revenues in ships, based upon the mix we have.
Joseph Campbell - Lehman Brothers: Okay, great. Thanks.
Ronald D. Sugar - Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Okay. Yeah, near term, yeah, long term. Yeah, long term. Who knows long term? With respect to your other comment, first of all, let me point out that a substantial portion of Newport News is work, its fixed price. In fact by dollar volume of the $3 billion or so they do there, overall majority of it is fixed price, in some form, fixed price incentive. As we move into the submarine work, its fixed price, the carrier production work is fixed price, they are extraordinarily attentive to cost at Newport News and Mike Petters is the executive who runs Newport News has been extraordinarily focused on efficiency and cost, because in fact it makes a significant difference to the profit of this Company of how he performs. The ability of both yards to work together and share best practices is very, very important. Yet there are somewhat different cost structures in both yards, for example the Newport News yard does need to maintain some cost structure additions to provide nuclear safety issues that we don’t deal within the Gulf, we streamlined the Gulf for that. And years and years ago, probably three years ago, the Gulf also did some nuclear work; it does not do that today. So we have different cost structures in different parts of the business. But fundamentally we are driven by costs and better cost performance results and profits. So I think what you are going to see continued attendance in that regard.
James F. Palmer - Chief Financial Officer: Hi. This is Jim. I would just point out or echo what Ron had said, in some ways cost type contracts, or as the customers are concerned about cost, as anyone else as. And with the margin rate emphasis that we have had, overrun in a contract to increase sales declines the margin rate which is not what we are after. So I can assure you that we are after delivering our cost commitments to our customers, to all of ourselves that we have used for our planning purpose. So, the emphasis is on equally on cost, whether it’s at Newport News or at Pascagoula.
Joseph Campbell - Lehman Brothers: Great. It just struck me given all the years of sort of two Navies, the nuke Navy and the rest of the Navy that you start announcing but there is kind of one customer?
Ronald D. Sugar - Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well, I think this is the future and I think what we are seeing is inter-relationships. If you think about it, when you have to fund an aircraft carrier, it takes a significant amount of total obligational authority away from other ships and when you don’t fund an aircraft carrier you could fund other ships. The natural effect of that rippling through the industrial base, is the movement of work. And we think that over time its better to be able to deal with this in an integrated way and we can basically share work and not have to rapidly hire and rapidly lay off the highly skilled workers. We found it over time, that industrial bases in both those shipyards is a much more efficient way to go. It’s win-win for the government, its win-win for us.
James F. Palmer - Chief Financial Officer: And in fact, I made a quick comment in my remarks earlier. Now the Navy has been very supportive of this and specifically for that reason that, you are right. Historically there has been more of a narrowly defined missions and budgets that plug with that and perhaps not as much cost over effect within the Navy itself. The Navy is looking to the future; they are taking actions to think about their portfolio in a more integrated, aggregated sense. And they see this step on our part as very aligned with where they need to go as well. So it works well together for us and for the customers.
Joseph Campbell - Lehman Brothers: Thanks. That’s very helpful. Appreciate it.
Ronald D. Sugar - Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks Joe.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Banc of America.
Robert Stallard - Banc of America Securities: Good afternoon.
Ronald D. Sugar - Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Hi.
Robert Stallard - Banc of America Securities: Ron, just a structural question. You highlighted how much your operating margin has improved since 2003, do you think you are now as a Company reaching the point where the operating margin is like a slowdown in terms of its upward progress?
Ronald D. Sugar - Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, Robert. Clearly we have had a dramatic improvement in the last 4 years or 5 years. You are not going to see that going forward but we are going to see some improvement but at a slower rate.
Robert Stallard - Banc of America Securities: Okay. As a follow up, looking to the longer term as well, what’s your thoughts on the trajectory of the US defense budget, looking at both the core budget and the supplemental?
Ronald D. Sugar - Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I think every year this time, there is a lot of concern that the defense budget is either peaked or is going to be reduced substantially. We do not see that, Robert. We certainly see an ’08 budget which is substantially stronger than the ’07 budget. The Northrop programs and interests are very well provided for. Based upon our early understanding of the ’09 budget process and as you know that’s just still under way in the Pentagon and is not yet been presented to the Hill. Every indication we have is that there will be a continued growth of regional proportions in the basic budget. This is quite separate from the supplementals, but the very basic budget we expect is going to grow as well, in terms of procurement and RDT&E. As far as the supplemental is concerned, that’s a different situation, that’s going to be debated by Congress here in the spring, there is going to be need for supplementals, obviously to handle the war, the operational issues. And also frankly some additional procurement re-plenishment. Where we go with those after the next administration comes in whether those are handled separately or whether they are part of the initial submittal, I do not know. One thing I will tell you though is that this corporation is reasonably resistant to a significant reduction in supplementals or a more rapid withdrawal from Iraq than maybe some other companies, but we are not participating, have not in the last several years, in much of the supplemental money. But the basic money in terms of the basic budget for procurement RDT&E, we see that continuing to be strong in ’09 and probably in ‘010.
Robert Stallard - Banc of America Securities: That’s right. Thanks Ron.
Ronald D. Sugar - Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Citigroup.
George Shapiro - Citigroup: Hi. Good morning.
Ronald D. Sugar - Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, George.
George Shapiro - Citigroup: Just a couple of questions, the ship revenues were a lot higher in the quarter than what you have been forecasting for the year. Since that seems like a fairly predictable thing, so I was just wondering, kind of what happened in the quarter that you hadn’t captured it in your guidance before?
Ronald D. Sugar - Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Ship’s revenue for the year essentially are right on our guidance at the very beginning of the year, George…
George Shapiro - Citigroup: You weren’t guiding for this much of an increase in Q4 relative to where we were in Q3. So I was just wondering?
Ronald D. Sugar - Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: George, we have only given an annual guidance and we had arranged for ships and the actuals came right in the middle, of essentially that range.
George Shapiro - Citigroup: Okay. And then just in general, Jim, if you take a look at your guidance, you are getting 2% benefit in earnings from share reduction which is about $0.10, you are getting another $0.19 benefit from the $100 million increase in pension income. Granted that during the year you had some legal issues and you had some benefits. It wouldn’t seem just with those two items by itself, you get up to 540 or so. So it wouldn’t seem just off the top of my head that you are getting, projecting a big increase in the operating earnings out there and I am just wondering whether you are just being overly conservative or there is some major things that I am missing.
Ronald D. Sugar - Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: George, as I think about the guidance going forward, essentially there are upsides or uppers from ’06, I am sorry, ’07, for pension, for additional volume. Tax rate is a negative. Earnings per share or weighted shares outstanding is a positive. And there are operational improvements that go into it as well. Those are the four items that essentially move from ’07 to ’08.
George Shapiro - Citigroup: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein from Merrill Lynch.
Ronald Epstein - Merrill Lynch: Yes. Good afternoon guys. Ron, could you walk through in maybe a little bit more detail. You did some on your introductory remarks. Some of the upcoming programs that you are keeping your eye on?
Ronald D. Sugar - Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Sure. Obviously the big news items are involving anchors, where we think that the current plan is to go to a defense acquisition board meeting. We have been told the 13th of February, which will be a review, it would be under secretary defense, and then following that of shortly there afterwards, pulled that there will be an announcement of a decision, winner take all. That same DAB date is the date for the BAMS program which is an unmanned reconnaissance program for the Navy. So that when we have in the middle of both those, we have our final proposals in on as to the competitors. I did mention the aerial comment sensor restart as you recall a couple of years ago, there was a competition. We are unsuccessful in that competition. However, within less than a year after the program was initiated, they were canceled, there was a reconsideration on how to proceed. Two things happened from that, one is a substantial amount of near term money came to us to upgrade the guard rail program, which we are doing common. And secondly, a decision to restart the Earl comment sensor competition, and we see that competition opening up this year, and probably get an RFP sometime later in the year and perhaps the down select in ’09. We have proposals in on PSAT, we have teamed with Lockheed, that’s a very, very large job for us. We are providing the payload for the satellite next big portion of the job with our partner Lockheed. The JLTV, as we have said we have announced our anticipate… intention to participate there. And we were selected as one of two in a down select on the GPS ground station work. And we will be in a process over the next year or so of proceeding the bill prototypes in parallel with our competitor and then there will be a down select probably about a year from now on that one. So, and there are probably about another five or 6,000 other programs that were probably in the process of getting, preparing updates for, that will happen. So those are a few that I think kind of really catch the headlines.
Ronald Epstein - Merrill Lynch: Okay. Great. And then if I could just follow up, maybe just a smaller accounting question. On the quarter if you can take out some of the smaller M&A that you did, what was the organic growth for the Company topline?
Ronald D. Sugar - Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: For the quarter? Ron, I guess it’s easier for me to answer it for the year I think, you take out the acquisitions and we are commenting it up 5% range organic growth.
Ronald Epstein - Merrill Lynch: Okay. Great. Thanks.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies.
Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Co.: Thank you very much. Two questions. One to go back to electronics. Very nice showing for the year and nice to see, it looks like you are getting some of the risk programs under your belt. Could you elaborate a little bit more on where you are in terms of the Mesa Radar and some of the other items?
Wesley G. Bush - President and Chief Operating Officer: Yes. Howard, its Wes. Let me take you through that a little bit. On both programs just to give you a headline summary, on both programs we are continuing to make good progress, and we are continuing to perform within our established EAC. So we are very, very pleased with how that’s going. You asked specifically about the Mesa programs. We are finishing off the developments test and evaluation phase. We have some software upgrades that are underway as well as I mentioned at the end of the third quarter, we are continuing to focus on getting the electro-magnetic interference testing done this quarter, the first quarter of this year. We do expect to get into the type exceptions testing later this quarter or early next quarter, in that kind of range or time span. And as we think about retiring the risk over this program, we are really looking to that type acceptance test set of activities to get that risk retired by the third quarter of this year. So good progress, we are pleased with what the teams are doing there. There is always challenges and risks on these leading edged programs, but if you look back to where we were, this time last year, we have made tremendous progress on both Block 60 and on Mesa.
Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Co.: And so I didn’t hear you talk about the $40 million exposure. Well I did find it in the queue, or do you feel more comfortable that going away?
Wesley G. Bush - President and Chief Operating Officer: There has really been no change with respect to our perspective on that so the exposure that we have in the queue continues to be our position on that.
Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Co.: And just a larger macro question for Ron. If you look at your outlook, it’s kind of 3% sort of growth number and while I recognize cash as more important than revenues. The budget overall is growing it at, we will call that high single digits, and so you are lagging a little bit. I know some of it is always mixed, but is there any incentive for you or for the broad sort of ask you to sort of step up the pace?
Ronald D. Sugar - Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Of course, we are trying to step up the pace, wherever it makes sense, but we also want to take on good contracts too. We are not just driving ourselves to topline. I am not sure about the high single digits. I mean that is a different budget than I am aware of. But certainly what we are involved in, we have given you our best guidance for it. Next year, we have not given you a longer range forecast. And remember the budget for next year with the government will be a planned set of commitments which will play out over the following years after that. We are certainly trying to drive the needle up as fast as we can. But we are much more concerned about cash earnings per share, and the quality of earnings. And then just pure topline we can obviously go get topline easily anytime to take on bad contracts. But I think that’s not something that we are about doing.
Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Co.: Thank you.
Ronald D. Sugar - Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Okay. Well we are at the end of the hour and I just want to thank everybody for your participation and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.
Operator: And thank you for your participation in today’s conference. This concludes the presentation, and you may disconnect.
